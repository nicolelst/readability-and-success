standard of care for intraperitoneal injury in hemodynamically stable patients after blunt abdominal trauma has been replaced by non-operative management (NOM). However, selective NOM, depending on the situation, seems necessary in determining the treatment plan. In this study, we attempted to identify risk factors for surgical or angiographic intervention (SAI) in hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal trauma patients. This retrospective study which included adult patients who were brought to a regional trauma center was conducted from March 2015 to October 2019. We evaluated the characteristics of blunt abdominal trauma patients and analyzed factors that were related to the requirement of SAI in these patients. Patients were divided into SAI and conservative management (CM) groups. We reviewed 1,176 patients, and after exclusions, of whom 248 blunt abdominal trauma and free fluid observed on CT were identified. The mean pulse rate was higher in the SAI than in the CM (P=0.025). Laboratory findings showed that lactate and delta neutrophil index (DNI) levels were higher in the SAI than in the CM (P=0.002 and 0.026 respectively). Additionally, the mean free fluid size in the SAI (85.69mm) was significantly larger than that in the CM (68.12mm; P=0.001), and blush was more frequently observed in the SAI (P&lt;0.001). In multivariate analysis, only blush was an independent prognostic factor for SAI (OR 11.7, 95% CI, 5.1-30.8, P&lt;0.001). In hemodynamically stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma, blush but also high lactate and DNI are associated with the requirement of interventional radiology and\/or surgery. ","2":"Recent clinical practice recommendations have radically modified the management of colonic diverticulitis. The goal of our study was to evaluate a treatment pathway for uncomplicated diverticulitis and to analyze the outcome (patient compliance, treatment failure and complications). All patients who presented to the emergency department with the diagnosis of uncomplicated diverticulitis were prospectively included in this study. The treatment pathway included an outpatient clinical re-assessment by a gastrointestinal surgeon. In case of symptomatic treatment failure, oral antibiotics were prescribed. If developed clinical signs of severity developed, the patient was referred to the emergency department for new laboratory and imaging workup. Eighty-seven patients were included. The mean interval before re-assessment was 2.8 days. Fifty-nine patients (67.8%) had symptomatic treatment upon discharge from the emergency department and were reassessed as outpatients by the surgical team. Patient evolution was satisfactory for 45 (76.3%); 10 (16.9%) required oral antibiotics. One (1.7%) patient developed complicated diverticulitis. Thirty-four (39.1%) patients did not comply with the current recommendations. In our experience, uncomplicated diverticulitis can be treated effectively in an ambulatory setting followed by early re-assessment by a surgeon. ","3":"","4":"Bariatric surgery is now recognized as the most effective treatment of morbid obesity, leading to durable weight loss and resolution of associated co-morbidities. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are the two most widely used operations today. However, potentially serious medical, surgical, and\/or psychiatric complications can occur that raise questions regarding the benefits of this type of surgery. These complications can lead to surgical re-operations, iterative hospitalizations, severe nutritional deficiencies and psychological disorders. Indeed, death from suicide is said to be three times higher than in non-operated obese patients. These results are of concern, all the more because of the high prevalence of patients lost to follow-up (for various and multifactorial reasons) after bariatric surgery. However, better knowledge of post-surgical sequelae could improve the information provided to patients, the preoperative evaluation of the benefit\/risk ratio, and, for patients undergoing surgery, the completeness and quality of follow-up as well as the detection and management of complications. The development of new strategies for postoperative follow-up such as telemedicine but also the mobilization of all the actors along the healthcare pathway can make inroads and warrant further study.","5":"","6":"Small bowel obstruction syndromes (SBO) represent one of the main causes of emergency admission for surgical abdominal pain. The 2018 Bologna Guidelines (Ten Broek et al. 2018) recommend non-operative management at the outset if there are no signs of severity; surgery is proposed after 72h for the 20-30% of patients who fail medical management. However, these recommendations were based on old studies published at a time when laparoscopic surgery was not commonplace and when diagnostic capabilities (particularly for establishing etiology) were less developed than they are today. Additionally, the advent and development of laparoscopy and enhanced rehabilitation after surgery have led to a decrease in surgical morbidity. These guidelines are therefore now debated and several recent publications have encouraged urgent or semi-urgent surgical management for patients presenting for SBO in order to reduce morbidity, mortality, duration of hospitalization and costs, and to improve the feasibility of therapeutic laparoscopy. Prompt surgical management could also reduce the risk of recurrent small bowel obstructions. This model for early surgical management probably cannot be applied to all patients. It therefore seems important to select those patients at risk for failure of medical treatment and to identify those in whom the probability of successful laparoscopy is high. New radiological tools should allow better selection in the future. At the present time, the indications for early surgery \"within 24h\" should be emphasized.","7":"","8":"","9":null,"10":"The spleen can be affected by many conditions, some of which are easily diagnosed by conventional imaging, mainly using computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. Despite the contribution of functional radiology techniques such as positron emission tomography, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose certain focal splenic lesions and definitive diagnosis sometimes requires histological confirmation by percutaneous biopsy or more rarely by diagnostic intervention. Once a diagnosis has been established, treatment is based mainly on surgery: total splenectomy for malignant lesions, or partial splenectomy whenever possible for benign lesions benign that are symptomatic and\/or at risk of rupture.","11":null,"12":"Postoperative constipation occurs relatively frequently, and can involve drug-related, surgical and lifestyle and dietary factors. Gastrointestinal motility can be altered by inflammation, surgery, opioid medications, hypnotics, anti-secretory or anesthetic drugs or by functional modifications for which the physiopathology is not well defined. There are a number of laxatives available. These include bulk laxatives, osmotic laxatives and locally acting laxatives such as suppositories and enemas. Stimulant laxatives have a role to play in the short-term management of persistent constipation. 5-HT4 receptor antagonists are recommended in refractory constipation. Other specific therapeutic laxatives can be proposed such as methylnaltrexone in opioid-induced constipation or neostigmine in Ogilvie's syndrome. The prevention and\/or early detection of iatrogenic constipation, whether postoperative or not, is essential and the knowledge how to improve patient comfort and reduce the duration of gastrointestinal motor disorders with specific drugs or other means is essential, particularly the postoperative period.","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"Surgery is a last-resort treatment for the management of severe constipation, an alternative after failure of medical treatment. We can distinguish two types of management: \"conservative\" colon-sparing surgery, i.e. the Malone procedure (MP), or sacral neuromodulation (SNM), and \"radical\" surgery such as colorectal resection. While the place of SNM remains to be defined, the MP is well codified and has shown very satisfactory results. For radical treatment, total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis is the reference procedure because it is the best documented. The place of more limited segmental colectomies is poorly defined and needs a more precise identification of the colonic segment involved. Finally, it is imperative that any severe constipation be managed within a multidisciplinary radiology-medico-surgical consultative program. Indeed, a multidisciplinary strategy allows rigorous selection of patients, the only guarantee of better long-term functional results, even though they unfortunately remain uncertain.","17":"Bariatric surgery can induce changes in digestive motility that are de novo or secondary to an improvement or aggravation of previous disorders due to obesity. Alterations of digestive motility are frequently part of the mechanism of action and a result of surgery. They are not rare and they are not always associated with an increase in weight loss but can lead to the negative consequences on quality of life, which are more or less reversible as a real surgical complication. Knowledge of these complications has become essential, especially in this period when bariatric surgery often concerns patients who have already undergone an operation. Thus, the changes in digestive motility after bariatric surgery and the complications that may result from them must be known and considered to adapt surgical techniques to each patient, both in the case of a first intervention and in the case of a reoperation, which is becoming more and more frequent. The objective of this review is to synthesize alterations of esophageal and gastro-intestinal motility secondary to bariatric surgical procedures.","18":"Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a syndrome associating chronic or recurrent obstructive symptoms with intestinal dilation on imaging but without organic obstruction in the digestive tract. It is a rare disease with varying severity whose diagnosis is very complex. The diagnosis is based on clinical and paraclinical arguments in the context of repetitive occlusive syndromes when no mechanical obstruction of the digestive lumen is observed. Abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography (CT) must be performed to rule out a mechanical obstruction. An additional reference examination is trans-duodenal manometry of the small intestine, which is almost never normal in CIPO, but the test is rarely systematically performed. CIPO can be primary (acquired or congenital) or secondary to a systemic pathology (neurological, metabolic, etc.) resulting in neuromuscular damage to the intestinal tract. There are familial forms associated with genetic mutations. The majority of CIPO cases are idiopathic. Symptoms of the CIPO syndrome should be investigated with a complete assessment, guided by questioning and clinical examination that should also focus on urinary, neurological and cardiac involvement. Pathological tissue analysis is interesting for the etiological classification but is difficult to obtain. CIPO must be distinguished from non-CIPO intestinal dysmotility. Management must be carried out in an expert center with multidisciplinary care involving gastroenterologists, nutritionists, psychologists, radiologists, pathologists and digestive surgeons. It is essentially based on symptomatic management (especially with pro-kinetic agents and analgesics), nutritional support, as well as psychological support in view of its impact on quality of life. Surgical management is sometimes necessary.","19":"Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) is a benign non-tumoral disorder of the major papilla. It occurs mainly after cholecystectomy but can also occur before surgery. Biliary pain and biliary colic are the most frequent symptoms although recurrent pancreatic pain or pancreatitis can also be presenting symptoms. In about half of the cases, there is a fibrotic stricture of the sphincter of Oddi, probably secondary to the passage of biliary stones, while in the remaining half, the syndrome is due to ampullary motility disorders. The diagnosis of SOD first requires exclusion of choledocholithiasis or ampullary tumor, by means of ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Findings on biliary manometry will establish the diagnosis, but this technique is performed less and less often because its high risk of inducing pancreatitis discourages its use as a diagnostic procedure. Biliary scintigraphy offers a risk-free alternative albeit with lower sensitivity. Medical treatment relies on the administration of trimebutine and nitroglycerine when pain occurs. Their efficacy is moderate. Sometimes patients are referred for endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic treatment should be performed only for patients with biliary pain associated with hepatic function disorders and\/or bile duct dilatation. Practicians and patients should be aware that endoscopic sphincterotomy in this clinical setting is associated with a high risk of pancreatitis and its efficacy is limited in patients with pain but without laboratory anomalies or dilatation of the biliary duct (type III Milwaukee classification). Patients with Milwaukee classification type III disorders have mostly functional complaints or psychosocial disabilities and require only medical management.","20":"","21":"Functional defecation disorders (FDDs) and fecal incontinence (FI) are common anorectal disorders often distressing and significantly add to the healthcare burden. They present with multiple, overlapping symptoms that can often obscure the underlying pathophysiology and can pose significant management dilemmas. A detailed history, stool diaries and visual scales of stool form, a careful digital rectal examination are needed to guide anorectal physiology tests. With high-resolution (3-D) anorectal manometry, anal ultrasonography, (magnetic resonance) defecography and imaging, and neurophysiological tests, it is possible to define and characterize the underlying structural and functional abnormalities more accurately. In this review, we present a succinct update on the latest knowledge with regards to the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of FDDS, fecal incontinence and abnormalities of rectal capacity (i.e., megarectum, microrectum).","22":"Considerable progress has been made in therapeutic endoscopy over recent years and new techniques now offer access to a new space, the submucosal space, thus paving the way for new therapeutic perspectives, in particular, for functional endoscopy. The first of these applications, POEM (Per-oral endoscopic myotomy), has become, since the beginning of the 2010's, an endoscopic alternative to Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia. The results of this technique have been fully documented, and the technique has replaced pneumatic dilatation and become the standard treatment for this indication with equivalent effectiveness compared to traditional surgery, but with less morbidity. Indeed, the overall efficacy is around 90%, results are stable over time, and severe morbidity is less than 1%. Later, other motility disorders, such as spastic disorders, have been treated, certainly with less impressive outcomes than for achalasia, but still, of interest. This approach has also been applied to post-fundoplication motility disorders, whose de novo prevalence can be as high as 20%, and for which management is complex; this represents another new non-surgical perspective. The POEM procedure for this indication, in addition to myotomy, allows performance of a partial incision of the wrap with substantial symptomatic relief. In conclusion, the technique seems to have a bright future as it is progressively applied to more and more motility disorders.","23":"Gastroparesis is the most common gastric motility disorder. The cardinal symptoms are nausea, vomiting, gastric fullness, early satiety, or bloating, associated with slow gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Delayed gastric emptying is demonstrated by a gastric emptying scintigraphy or by a breath test. Gastroparesis can be idiopathic, post-operative, secondary to diabetes, iatrogenic, or post-infectious. Therapeutic care must be multidisciplinary including nutritional, medical, endoscopic and surgical modes. The complications of delayed gastric emptying must be sought and addressed, particularly malnutrition, in order to identify and correct vitamin deficiencies and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. An etiology should be identified and treated whenever possible. Improvement in symptoms can be treated by dietary regimes and pharmaceutical treatments, including prokinetics. If these are not effective, specialized endoscopic approaches such as endoscopic or surgical pyloromyotomy aim at relaxing the pyloric sphincter, while the implantation of an electrical stimulator of gastric muscle should be discussed in specialized centers.","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"A 67-year-old man was treated with systemic chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery for microsatellite instable (MSI), deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) right colonic cancer with peritoneal metastases.

Stress associated with an operation amounted to 31.8; it was higher at the time of the procedure (49.6) and immediately beforehand (39.4), particularly among the least experienced nurses. The most widely represented stress factors were associated with the surgical team (perceived incompetence, lack of confidence), relational problems with regard to the surgeon, and team members' disruptive behavior. By contrast, familiarity with the team or the procedure seemed to shield the nurses from stress. Feelings of stress had a relatively frequent impact on quality of life (33%), family and personal life (26%), with chronic (recurrent or constant) stress symptoms reported among 20% of respondents. Among operating theater nurses, stress associated with an operation was particularly strong among the least experienced professionals, when the type of procedure or the other team members were unfamiliar, and in the event of disruptive behavior. Stress factor improvement should be a priority, the objective being to enhance professional and personal quality of life, while better ensuring patient safety.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the performance of the Gastric Cancer Collaborative Group nomograms developed in 2014 by Kim et al., using a cohort of patients from a 10-year single institution experience in gastric cancer management. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for histologically confirmed gastric cancer at First Surgical Clinic of Padua University Hospital (Italy) from January 2010 to May 2020. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were employed to assess the effect of the variables of interest on mortality and recurrence. Multivariable analysis was performed by considering the variables included in the Gastric Cancer Collaborative Group nomograms in order to validate them. The performance of the nomograms was evaluated using Harrell's C-index and calibration plots. Overall, 168 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 20.1 months. On multivariable analysis, tumor location, lymph node ratio, and pathological T stage were associated with recurrence; age, tumor location, lymph node ratio, and pT stage were associated with OS (overall survival). The nomograms had good discriminatory capability to classify both OS (C-index: 0.75) and DFS (disease-free survival) (C-index 0.72). The corrected C-Index for DFS based on the AJCC staging system revealed better prediction (C-Index 0.75), while the corrected C-Index for OS had worse discrimination ability compared with the current nomogram (C-Index 0.72). The Gastric Cancer Collaborative Group nomograms demonstrated good performances in terms of prediction of both OS and DFS on external validation. The two nomograms are easy to apply, and variables included are widely available to most facilities. ","46":"The pre-operative work-up for non-metastatic colon cancer includes colonoscopy and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) with intravenous (IV) contrast. Colonoscopic determination of the anatomical location of the tumor may be erroneous, particularly with a long redundant colon (dolichocolon), and the search for synchronous colon neoplasms is limited when the endoscope cannot traverse the tumor-bearing segment. While computed tomography colonography angiography (CTC-A) makes it possible to assess distant tumor metastasis, it remains limited for the assessment of loco-regional extension. CTC-A requires specific colonic preparation, controlled colonic insufflation with CO2, and an injection of IV contrast. CTC-A provides a 3-D view of the overall morphology of the colon and precisely localizes the site of the colonic tumor. Merging the images of the colon with those of mesenteric and colonic vessels provides a representation of anatomical vascular variations. This information could help the surgeon to better plan the colectomy. The use of two-dimensional images of CTC-A with sections perpendicular to the major axis of the tumor-bearing colonic segment can provide precise information on the degree of parietal extension and be useful in evaluating the value of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.","47":"There is a gap in evidence that demonstrates an increased risk of hernia formation in laborers. A notable incidence of a second asymptomatic hernia among people making a workers' compensation claim for a hernia would suggest that the pathology is not acute and probably not related to work, or the performance of a single strenuous event. We performed a retrospective database study of a consecutive sample of 106 adults who claimed a work-related abdominal hernia between September 2016 and December 2018 and had a Computed Tomography (CT) scan as part of a diagnostic workup. Hernias were classified as incidental if patients had a contralateral inguinal hernia with unilateral groin symptoms, or if patients had a ventral hernia with only groin symptoms or vice versa. Thirty-three percent of patients had an incidental hernia. No patient factors were associated with having an incidental hernia. Higher BMI and having a concurrent incidental hernia were associated with lower odds of surgical treatment under the injury claim. Abdominal symptoms after a work event might lead to a diagnosis of hernia, and there is a notable likelihood that the hernia is incidental and unrelated to work. New symptoms at or near the site of an abdominal hernia may or may not be from the hernia, and very often are more consistent with an abdominal muscle strain. The clinical or imaging finding of an abdominal wall defect or the presence of a hernia may be incidental, unrelated to the physical activity. ","48":"The hepatic compartment syndrome (HCS) corresponds to compression of the intraparenchymal liver tissue (intrahepatic pressure greater than the portal vein pressure, i.e. &gt;10-15mmHg) caused by a subcapsular or intraparenchymal hematoma of the liver. It can lead to reversal of portal flow and hepatic parenchymal necrosis. We report the case of a patient who underwent a right radical nephrectomy by laparoscopy and who presented with HCS due to a subcapsular hematoma of the liver. Emergency decompression of the liver via laparotomy was performed, which allowed rapid clinical and laboratory improvement.","49":"Researchers and practitioners are faced with an exponential increase in the number of systematic reviews (SRs) (with or without meta-analysis), a so-called `secondary' research method that synthesizes data from primary research. This growing number, sometimes with discordant results on the same subject or with non-conclusions, has led to the introduction of the concept of reviews to synthesize SR in order to combine scientific knowledge useful to practitioners. These so-called ``umbrella reviews'' (UR) constitute a new tertiary research tool. Surgical research is no exception to this development but umbrella surgical reviews remain relatively rare. Any UR must be transparent and meet rigorous methodological criteria. The UR could thus provide answers to practical questions in the field of surgery, but only on condition that the bias of the included SRs is limited. Let us not forget that the base requirement of clinical surgical research remains the good methodological quality of clinical studies (primary research). Only thus can SRs or URs (secondary or tertiary research) be more useful and decisive.","50":"Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) aims to improve anorectal function in patients with disorders of anal continence and rectal emptying. The mechanism of action of SNM is not well known, and its indications are still under evaluation. We report the functional results and morbidity of a prospective cohort treated between 2002 and 2019. A total of 284 patients (of 423 tested) had implantation of a SNM. Five patients (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. Among those who had implantation, the indications for SNM were anal incontinence (n=376), refractory constipation (n=17), anterior resection syndrome (n=13), solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (n=7), and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n=10). The morbidity rate was 2.7% (Dindo-Clavien&gt;2), 33 patients (11%) required explantation for infection (n=5), pain (n=2), inefficacy (n=24) or other reasons (rectal cancer) (n=3). It was necessary to change the stimulator in 68 patients (24%) during the follow-up period. Regarding the group of patients with anal incontinence, functional results showed improvement of the incontinence score in 40% and of quality of life in 25% after a mean follow-up of 55months. SNM constitutes a mini-invasive treatment associated with low morbidity. Its' efficacy in anal incontinence makes it a priority approach.

Secondarily to endoscopic maneuvers, Stapfer type 3 may also occur, causing pancreatic or biliary ductal lesions. When perforation is highlighted following an endoscopic procedure, treatment depends on the presence of an intraperitoneal or retro-peritoneal liquid or aerial effusion. When perforation is contained and clinical tolerance remains satisfactory, conservative treatment is carried out.

Herein we evaluated the feasibility and the outcomes of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) using video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) or laparoscopic surgery (VALS) for esophageal leiomyoma enucleation. Retrospective study of patients who were treated via VATS or VALS for esophageal leiomyoma enucleation in \"Hanoi Viet Duc Hospital\" from 2010 to 2017 by the same operator. The operative approach, tumor size, complications and outcomes after surgery were recorded. Seventy-five patients were included. Mean age was 41.9 (range 20-68) years. The male\/female sex ratio was 2.1:1. Fifty-five patients had clinical symptoms (73.3%). Tumors were identified in the upper third (12%), middle third (51%), and lower third (37%) of the esophagus. Mean tumor size was 3.7 (range 2-11) cm. VALS enucleation was performed in 23 patients who had leiomyoma located near the cardia (gastroesophageal junction or abdominal esophagus). The remaining 52 patients underwent right (n=42) or left VATS (n=10). Five patients (6.7%) sustained esophageal mucosa injury during dissection, repaired by MIS without late morbidity. A mini-incision (2 mini-laparotomies and 1 thoracotomy) was required in three patients (4%) due to large tumor size or mucosal injury. The mean operative time was 105min in VATS and 174min in VALS. No major perioperative surgical or medical complications were reported. The mean duration of hospital stay was 7.2 (range 5-12) days. MIS enucleation of esophageal leiomyoma is technically safe and associated with a high therapeutic success rate with low medico-surgical morbidity. VATS could be applied for almost all esophageal leiomyoma tumors; however, the VALS approach was preferred for tumors located near the gastroesophageal junction in order to create an anti-reflux valve after enucleation.

Three types of interventions were considered: extended right hemi-colectomy, left hemi-colectomy and splenic flexure resection. The LAP and OPEN groups were matched according to propensity score and compared with Chi-square, Mann-Whitney tests, and multivariate regression models. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The study population consisted of 399 patients, including 297 operated by LAP and 102 by OPEN. Extended right hemi-colectomy was performed in 35.8% of cases, left hemi-colectomy in 32.8% and splenic flexure resection in 31.4%. After propensity score matching, the LAP (n=64) and OPEN (n=64) groups were comparable for all pre-operative variables and tumor characteristics. The LAP group showed less blood loss and a shorter interval to return of transit and feeding compared to the OPEN group, regardless of the resection technique. There were no differences between the groups in terms of overall survival and 5-year recurrence-free survival. These results support the application of laparoscopy for the resection of SFC.

Data are required to confirm the effects of a transition from biological mesh to biosynthetic resorbable mesh. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. It was based on a decision analysis model built with clinical and economic data issued from a before-after study that included 94 patients hospitalized for ventral hernia repair at the University Hospital of Strasbourg (France) from June 2011 to February 2018. The effectiveness endpoint was the number of patients presenting with a serious specific complication or a general complication at 6 months. Data for surgical hospitalization stays, home hospitalizations and ambulatory care costs were included. We found fewer serious complications with biosynthetic mesh: 21% versus 33% with biologic mesh. A cost savings of US $5146 was determined. Deterministic sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic analysis confirmed our findings and the robustness of the model.

This was a single-center retrospective case-control study including patients who underwent ileostomy or colostomy reversal by a direct approach (REVERSAL group) compared to those who did not undergo stoma reversal (NON-REVERSAL group) during hepatic resection of rectal cancer metastasis between 2004 and 2016. Peri-operative data were collected. The primary outcome measure was the comprehensive complication index (CCI). The secondary outcomes were overall mortality, liver-related morbidity, duration of hospital stay and occurrence of gastrointestinal leaks. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23.0 software. Thirty liver resections were included; 14 in the REVERSAL group (female\/male=11\/19, age=60 years). No statistically significant difference was observed in the CCI scores (15 vs. 20.8; P=0.6). Complications occurred in 9 (64%) and 8 (50%) patients in the REVERSAL and NON-REVERSAL groups, respectively (P=0.48). No gastro-intestinal leaks or post-operative mortality occurred.

The objective of this update was, through a review of the literature, to identify the most suitable management to improve overall survival and\/or recurrence-free survival after R1 TME for rectal cancer. Published national quality guidelines and original studies were searched on Pubmed. Only studies and recommendations concerning the specific management of patients who had undergone R1 TME resection were selected. Five original non-randomized studies and seven published national quality guidelines were selected for review. For patients who have undergone R1 TME resection, the French and European published guidelines issued a Grade A recommendation in favor of post-operative radio-chemotherapy (RCT) for those in whom it had not already been performed pre-operatively. The French and European guidelines recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy was based only on expert agreement. The original studies emphasized the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy, as opposed to post-operative RCT, which did not seem to improve survival.

Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with serous or chylous drainage after pancreatic surgery were included in this analysis of a prospectively collected database between 01\/2014 and 12\/2016. Risk factors for CL and treatment options were compared. A subgroup analysis on those patients, who had drain removal despite of persistent CL with respect to the need of subsequent percutaneous drainage or reoperation within three months postoperatively, was performed. Sixty patients with CL were identified. Of those, 41 patients were treated with medium-chain triglyceride-diet, with a median duration of therapy of 12 days. In patients with CL, the type of treatment had no effect on time to drain removal (P=0.29) and morbidity (P=0.15). Furthermore, morbidity was not increased in patients who had their drains removed despite persistent CL (P=0.84).

A systematic literature review searching for the studies that assessed the outcome of CME of colon cancer was conducted. Electronic databases were queried from 2009 through November 2020. The main objectives of this review were to illustrate the technical aspects and outcome of CME and to summarize the findings of the published systematic reviews. Thirteen systematic reviews were retrieved. All reviews found CME to provide longer bowel, larger area of mesentery resected, and more lymph nodes (LNs) retrieved than standard colectomy. All systematic reviews except two found similar complication rates between CME and standard colectomy. Four systematic reviews documented the survival benefit of CME in regards to improved overall and disease-free survival. Using the laparoscopic approach for CME did not compromise the oncologic outcomes of the procedures, yet was associated with less intraoperative blood loss, faster recovery, and potential survival benefits. CME is associated with better specimen quality, more LNs clearance, and potential survival benefits compared to standard colectomy. However, the lack of robust data from well-designed multicenter randomized trials may prevent drawing firm conclusions on the oncologic benefits of CME. Further high-quality studies are needed before recommending CME as the standard of care for colon cancer.

The goal of this survey was to analyse workplace quality of life among French UH digestive surgeons. An online questionnaire was addressed to all members of sub-section 52-02 (digestive and visceral surgery) of the national university council (CNU). It contained isolated questions, as well as the specific Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) questionnaire, which assesses three fields: personal burnout (PBO), work-related burnout (WBO) and client-related burnout (CBO). While 132 (85%) out of the 156 surgeons responded, only 110 (70%) filled out the CBI questionnaire. Their perceptions of quality of life were poor or very poor (57%), and progressively poorer; this was mainly due to a lack of human, logistical and financial means, and also to conflictual relations with administration. The CBI questionnaire showed high scores for PBO (37%) and WBO (30%), with lower scores for CBO (8%). Depressive syndrome appeared among 26% of respondents. There were no significant differences according to region, gender or age.

In patients with mutated B-RAF, the efficacy of first-line anti-EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) associated with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic CRC is uncertain while that of anti-VEGF has been shown to be effective. The therapeutic pathways involving inhibition of B-RAF activity, although ineffective as monotherapy, have received marketing authorization when used in association with anti-EGFR for second-line treatment of metastatic CRC. Immunotherapy has provided very encouraging results in a recent phase III study in patients with microsatellite instability, irrespective of their B-RAF status. Finally, new therapies, targeting other RAF proteins and other specific receptors are currently under development. Surgery for liver metastases in patients with the B-RAF mutation should be considered whenever possible, after a complete search for peritoneal carcinomatosis and distant metastases, similarly to workup for patients without the B-RAF mutation.","93":"","94":"The management of recurrent anal fistulas after previous surgery is usually challenging.

The study included 138 patients with recurrent anal fistulas, 76.8% of which were complex. Failure of healing was recorded in 25 (18.1%) patients and fecal incontinence (FI) in 9 (6.5%). Patients with recurrent anal fistulas had significantly higher percentage of anterior, complex, and horseshoe fistulas than patients with primary fistulas. Surgery for recurrent anal fistulas was followed by a significantly higher rate of failure of healing than primary fistulas (18.1% vs. 9.8%, P=0.011), whereas the rates of FI were comparable amongst the two groups (6.5% vs. 2.8%, P=0.07). Patients who had more than two previous operations for anal fistula had a significantly higher rate of FI than patients who underwent one or two previous surgeries (20% vs. 3.7% vs. 14.3%, P=0.04), yet healing rates were comparable. Recurrent anal fistulas were more complex than primary fistulas. Surgical treatment of recurrent anal fistula was followed by a significantly higher rate of failure of healing and similar rate of FI as compared to primary anal fistulas.

","95":"The most widely practiced (standard) treatment of non-metastatic rectal cancer is based on proctectomy with mesorectal excision (partial or total according to the location of the tumor and commonly called TME). Surgery is preceded by CAP50-type chemoradiotherapy (capecitabineand 50 Grays radiation) and performed 6-8 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy. The development of new endoscopic, surgical, radiation-based and chemotherapeutic modalities leads surgeons to envisage customized treatment to find the best compromise between functional and oncologic results according to the locoregional extension of the tumor. Superficial lesions are amenable to transanal excision. T2-3 tumors&lt;4cm are amenable to rectal preservation when neoadjuvant treatment obtains a complete response, allowing local excision or close surveillance. Intensification endocavitary radiotherapy and induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimens to avoid recourse to salvage abdomino-perineal resection (APR) are under investigation. For locally advanced rectal cancers (T3-4 and all N+ irrespective of T), the following scenarios can be envisaged: for initially resectable tumors (T3N0, T1-T3N+, circumferential resection margin&gt;2mm), neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone aims to minimize the risk of local recurrence while avoiding the sequelae of radiotherapy. In case of initially non-resectable tumors (T4, circumferential resection margin&lt;1mm), induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy after short course radiotherapy provide better results than standard treatment in terms of complete response and recurrence-free survival, and should be routinely proposed in this indication.","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":null,"100":null,"101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"To analyze the collective learning curve in the performance of safe liver resections, using the decrease of severe postoperative complications (SPC) as a proxy for overall safety competency.

The 100 first consecutive cases of elective liver resections starting from January 1st, 2018 were included in the analysis. SPC were defined as CD&gt;IIIa during the first 90 postoperative days. We used a cumulative sum (CUSUM) technique to determine the number of cases required to achieve safety competency. We then compared case characteristics before and after the learning curve completion. SPC occurred in 15 cases (15%), including 5 deaths (5%). The CUSUM chart revealed a learning curve completion at the 49th case, marked by an inflection point towards the decrease in SPC (24.5% vs 5.9%; P=0.009). In period 2 (after), cases were associated with less diabetes, less synchronous digestive resection, more cirrhosis, and more prolonged preoperative chemotherapy. The rates of major resection (30.6% vs 29.9%; P=0.89) and biliary reconstruction were comparable, as were the operating time, and estimated blood loss.

Mortality occurs in 5-10% of patients after major surgery and remains a topic of interest. However, the ratio of mortality after postoperative complications in relation to overall complications varies between hospitals because of failure to rescue at the time of the complication. There are multiple factors that lead to complication-related mortality: they are patient-related, disease-related, but are related, above all, to the timeliness of diagnosis of the complication, the organisational aspects of management in private or public hospitals, hospital volume that corresponds to the centralisation of initial management or to the concept of referral centre in case of complications, to the team spirit, to communication between the health care providers and to the management of the complication itself. Several organisational advances are to be considered, such as the development of shorter hospitalisations and notably ambulatory surgery, as well as enhanced recovery programs. Remote monitoring and the contribution of artificial intelligence must also be evaluated in this context. The reduction of mortality after visceral surgery rests on several tactics: prevention of potentially lethal complications, the all-important reduction of failure to rescue, and risk management before, during and after hospitalisations that are increasingly shorter.","107":"The Delegation for Innovation in Health Care (DIES) was created by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health to centralize and support innovative health care projects.

All potential project leaders were free to explain the objectives of their project to our team. These projects were then classified according to their objective, their type, the medical specialty concerned, the target population and their purpose. The DIES graded the degree of innovation, advised on the need for complementary scientific evaluation and oriented the personnel in charge towards fitting financing structures. Between April 2016 and December 2018, the DIES received 269 potential project leaders, almost exclusively from the national territory of France, focused on diversified medical specialties with a slight predilection for chronic diseases and disabilities. The projects were often at an economically tenuous stage of development. Less than 5% of the projects concerned drug therapy. More than a third involved medical devices, including \"surgical\" projects (predominately orthopedics), disability compensation methodology, vascular problems and bandages. E-health, the organization of care, and a \"non-classifiable\" category that included wellness projects each represented 20% of the projects. Almost 80% of these projects had some electronically (e-) based mechanism. Only 15% of all projects had the ambition to meet an unmet or poorly covered need. Only about a third of the project leaders presented a clinical or medico-economic evaluation with sufficiently rigorous methodology to assess the achievement of their objectives. Innovative health projects are dominated by the search for improvement in the organization of the health care system and the care pathway with e-connected applications.

Through the possibilities of \"scalability\" and the \"augmented physician\" that it has helped to create, AI may also constitute a revolution in our practices. In the management of surgical emergencies, abdominal pain is one of the most frequent complaints of patients who present for emergency consultation, and up to 20% of patients prove to have an organic lesion that will require surgical management. In view of the very large number of patients concerned, the variety of clinical presentations, the potential seriousness of the etiological pathology that sometimes involves a life-threatening prognosis, healthcare workers responsible for these patients have logically been led to regularly rely on imaging examinations, which remain the critical key to subsequent management. Therefore, it is not surprising that articles have been published in recent years concerning the potential contributions of telemedicine (and teleradiology) to the diagnostic management of these patients, and also concerning the contribution of AI (albeit still in its infancy) to aid in diagnosis and treatment, including surgery.

Acquiring large amount of data on surgical care and modelling the process of surgery with artificial intelligence's computational methods could shed lights on system strengths and limitations and enable computer-based smart assistance. With this vision in mind, surgeons and computer scientists have joined forces in a novel discipline called Surgical Data Science. In this regard, operating room (OR) black boxes and surgical control towers are being developed to systematically capture comprehensive data on surgical procedures and to oversee and assist during operating rooms activities, respectively. Most of the early Surgical Data Science works have focused on understanding risks and resilience factors affecting surgical safety, the context and workflow of procedures, and team behaviors. These pioneering efforts in sensing and analyzing surgical activities, together with the advent of precise robotic actuators, bring surgery on the verge of a fourth revolution characterized by smart assistance in perceptual, cognitive and physical tasks.

This complication can lead to patient death in the very short term. The goal of this review is to provide the surgeon and intensivist with objective information to help them in their decision-making. In the early phase of severe AP, it is essential to monitor intra-vesical pressure (iVP) to allow early diagnosis of intra-abdominal hypertension or ACS. The treatment of ACS is both medical and surgical requiring close collaboration between the surgical and resuscitation teams. Medical treatment includes vascular volume repletion, prokinetic agents, effective curarization and percutaneous drainage of large-volume ascites. If uncontrolled respiratory or cardiac failure develops or if maximum medical treatment fails, most teams favor performing an emergency xipho-pubic decompression laparotomy with laparostomy. This procedure follows the principles of abbreviated laparotomy as described for abdominal trauma.","119":"Rectocele is defined as a hernia of the rectum with protrusion of the anterior rectal wall through the posterior wall of the vagina.

Rectocele may be isolated or associated with other disorders of pelvic stasis involving cystocele and uterine prolapse. Complementary exams (dynamic imaging and anorectal manometry) are essential before deciding on the surgical management of this condition. The indications for surgical management of rectocele are based on the intensity of symptoms and the resulting deterioration in quality of life, and surgery should be discussed after failure of medical treatment. Different approaches are possible, although there is currently no real consensus in the literature. The initial approach depends on the type of rectocele: if it involves the low or mid rectum or is isolated, an approach from below (transanal, transperineal, or transvaginal approach) can be proposed, while, in the presence of a high rectocele and\/or associated with various disorders of pelvic stasis, transabdominal rectopexy is more suitable.","120":"","121":"","122":"Pancreatic ascites (PA) is an unusual and little studied complication of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis.

Treatment was initially medical and then, in case of failure, interventional (endoscopic, radiological and\/or surgical). Data regarding epidemiology, therapeutic and follow-up data were collected retrospectively. Twenty-four patients were analysed; median follow-up was 18.5 months [6.75-34.25].

They can lead to intestinal consequences (anal incontinence, ano-genital fistula) or sexual consequences (dyspareunia, genital pain). The complexity of management of OASI lies in the multi-factorial nature of these consequences but also in the frequently lengthy interval before their appearance, often long after childbirth. Indeed, while 2.4% of women in childbirth develop OASI, up to 61% of them will present with anal incontinence15 to 25 years after childbirth. Immediate or delayed repair of the sphincter and perineum within a few hours of injury is therefore the rule, but there is no consensus on longer-term management. The patient must be educated on preventive actions (avoidance of pushing or straining, regularization of stool transit, muscle strengthening, etc.). Early detection of anal incontinence leads to prompt management, which is more effective. This review aims to synthesize the information necessary to provide clear and up-to-date patient information on OASI (risk factors and prevalence), the management of OASI, and the management of eventual complications in the setting of dedicated specialty consultations.

Furthermore, few gynecological specialists recommended systematic consultation with an ano-rectal specialist during acute management. In the medium term, ano-rectal specialists were more likely to explore gastro-intestinal symptoms, either clinically or through para-clinical studies. However, these studies did not systematically lead to interventional management in the absence of consensus, particularly for medium-term sphincter repair.

The CAT model is well suited for the assessment of surgical trainees during central venous access device implantation. It enables a close assessment of the learning process and the technical skills of trainees, which helps them improving in a safe, standardized manner.

As the frequency of bariatric procedures increases, so too does the incidence of revisional surgery, which has become becoming increasingly important. The surgeon must know the indications and the results of the various revisional procedures in order to best guide the therapeutic decision. The current challenge is to correctly select the patients for revisional surgery and to choose the appropriate procedure in each case. Multidisciplinary management is essential to patient re-assessment and to prepare the patient for a re- intervention. The objective of this update, based on data from all the most recent studies concerning revisional surgery, is to guide the surgeon in the choice of the revisional procedure, depending on patient characteristics, co-morbidities, the previously performed procedure, the type of failure or complication observed, but also on the surgeon's own habits and the center's expertise. The collected results show that revisional surgery is difficult, with higher complication rates and weight-loss results that are often lower than those of first-intent surgery. For these reasons, patient selection must be rigorous and multidisciplinary and the management in expert centers of these difficult situations must be encouraged.","167":null,"168":"","169":"","170":"Abdominal pelvic radiation therapy can induce acute or chronic lesions in the small bowel wall, called radiation enteritis. Treatment of acute radiation enteritis is essentially symptomatic; symptoms regress when radiation is discontinued. Conversely, late toxicity can occur up to 30 years after discontinuation of radiation therapy, posing diagnostic problems. Approximately one out of five patients treated by radiation therapy will present clinical signs of radiation enteritis, including obstruction, malabsorption, malnutrition and\/or other complications. Management should be multidisciplinary, centered mainly on correction of malnutrition. Surgery is indicated in case of complications (i.e., abscess, perforation, fistula) and\/or resistance to medical treatment; intestinal resection should be preferred over internal bypass.

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life between two groups of patients having a colostomy; those practicing CI vs those not practicing CI. The French Federation of Ostomy (FFO) members were evaluated by a self-questionnaire assessing their experience of CI. Quality of life as assessed by the Stoma-QOL questionnaire was compared between patients practicing CI or not. In total 752 patients were eligible for the study. The median age was 75 years, and 47.26% were men. The median duration between stoma surgery and questionnaire completion was 12.3 years. Forty-one percent of the patients practiced CI. The median quality of life score was significantly higher for the patients practicing the CI: (69.26 vs 58.33, P&lt;0.001). In multivariable analysis, the risk factors for not performing CI were age, obesity, the presence of colostomy for less than six years, and a non-oncologic indication for operation. CI appeared to improve the quality of life of patients with colostomy. This care is a therapeutic education issue and should be proposed to all patients.

Sixty-two patients underwent excision of endometriosis via a combined vaginal-laparoscopic approach (study group, or cases), while 71 patients underwent surgery via an exclusively laparoscopic route (controls). Rates of preoperative cyclical voiding difficulty and sensation of incomplete bladder emptying were comparable between the two groups. Preoperative urodynamic assessment was carried out in 18% of cases and 38% of controls, with abnormal results in 27.3% and 11.1% of cases and controls respectively. Early postoperative voiding difficulty (post-void residual&gt;100mL) occurred in 14.7% and 24.3% of cases and controls respectively. There was a significant reduction in risk of intermittent self-catheterisation of 13% at time of discharge in the study cases. Three months postoperatively, one case and 6 controls had persistent voiding dysfunction requiring prolonged self-catheterisation. The combined vaginal-laparoscopic approach for large rectovaginal endometriotic nodules could reduce the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction, when compared to an exclusively laparoscopic approach, most likely due to a reduced risk of damage to the pelvic splanchnic nerves at the paravaginal level.

Unfortunately, hospitals are themselves \"silent polluters\". As healthcare professionals, we are the guarantors not only of quality of patient care, but also of proper hospital conduct. The aim of this attempt at clarification is to outline what can be done in the operating theater to reduce the environmental impact of the treatments we administer. Our recommendations will go above and beyond regulatory frameworks and draw upon daily practice concerning waste management, energy consumption, utilization of anesthetic agents and multiple forms of waste.

This concept, initially called \"fast-track surgery\", has evolved into \"enhanced recovery or rehabilitation\" (ER), which highlights the improvement of post-operative procedures rather than the simple shortening of hospital stay. The main benefit of ER is the reduction of the impact of surgical trauma with an attendant reduction of post-operative complications. This result has been demonstrated based on a good level of evidence for multiple surgical specialties. Mild complications are the most impacted by this program. The reduction in the duration of stay is thus the result of the improvement in post-operative care. This update illustrates the benefits of ER by taking three examples of elective surgery in three major surgical specialties: colorectal surgery, orthopedics and gynecological surgery.

The only currently effective treatment for obesity is metabolic surgery, which confers prompt, lasting benefits. It is thus necessary to resume such surgery. To ensure that this resumption is both gradual and well-founded, we have devised a priority ranking plan. The flow charts we propose will help centres to identify priority patients according to a benefit\/risk assessment. Diabetes holds a central place in the decision tree. Resumption patterns will vary from one centre to another according to human, physical and medical resources, and will need adjustment as the epidemic unfolds. Specific informed consent will be required. Screening of patients with obesity should be considered, based on available knowledge. If Covid-19 is suspected, surgery must be postponed.

Patient follow-up should preferably be by teleconsultation.","198":null,"199":"The incidence of obesity in the general population has tripled in the past four decades. The number of bariatric surgeries performed annually has quadrupled in the past ten years due to this obesity epidemic. Concomitantly, the number of patients who are obese or who have undergone bariatric surgery and have become candidates for thyroid surgery has also increased considerably. Among patients undergoing thyroidectomy in the French population, the proportion of obese patients currently represents 10 to 20%. In addition, the frequency of benign and malignant thyroid pathologies seems to be increased by obesity, with a Hazard Ratio of around 1.8 for thyroid cancers in obese women. While obesity does not seem to influence the specific post-operative morbidity of thyroidectomy, a history of malabsorptive bariatric surgery should encourage the greatest caution in patients who need to undergo thyroid surgery since it is associated with a significant risk of severe hypocalcemia (&gt;60% in some studies) requiring intravenous calcium supplementation in about 20% of cases. In the latter situation, peri-operative vitamin D-calcium supplementation is essential. In addition, the replacement dose of Levothyroxine (T4) intended for replacement must also be adapted in obese patients, calculated not from the actual weight but from the ideal weight. The objective of this review is to discuss the influence of obesity on the evolution of nodular and neoplastic thyroid pathologies, on the morbidity of thyroid surgery as well as on post-operative drug treatments.

NGP are associated with a risk of malignant degeneration and must be distinguished from other benign gallbladder polypoid lesions that occur more frequently. NGP are adenomas and the main risk associated with their management is to fail to detect their progression to gallbladder cancer, which is associated with a particular poor prognosis. The conclusions of the recent European recommendations have a low level of evidence, based essentially on retrospective small-volume studies. Abdominal sonography is the first line study for diagnosis and follow-up for NGP. To prevent the onset of gallbladder cancer, or treat malignant degeneration in its early phases, all NGP larger than 10mm, or symptomatic, or larger than 6mm with associated risk factors for cancer (age over 50, sessile polyp, Indian ethnicity, or patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis) are indications for cholecystectomy. Apart from these situations, simple sonographic surveillance is recommended for at least five years; if the NGP increases in size by more than 2mm in size, cholecystectomy is indicated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is possible but if the surgeon feels that the risk of intra-operative gallbladder perforation is high, conversion to laparotomy should be preferred to avoid potential intra-abdominal tumoral dissemination. When malignant NGP is suspected (size greater than 15mm, signs of locoregional extension on imaging), a comprehensive imaging workup should be performed to search for liver extension: in this setting, radical surgery should be considered.","205":"The COVID-19 pandemic commands a major reorganisation of the entire French healthcare system.

In cases of colorectal surgery, there is pronounced heterogeneity in urinary catheterization, which is largely explained by fear of acute urinary retention (AUR). The objective of the work is to report on the current literature on postoperative urinary catheterization following colorectal surgery, particularly with regard to the risk of AUR, and thereby contribute to the standardization of perioperative practices. In colon surgery without preoperative urinary disorders, catheterization must not exceed 24h. In rectal surgery, catheter removal starting on postoperative D2 seems reasonable in the absence of AUR risk factor (RF). Male sex, past history of lower urinary tract obstruction, abdomino-perineal amputation (APA) and low rectal anastomosis are AUR risk factors that must be taken into account when deciding to withdraw the urinary catheter. While the role of a suprapubic catheter is not clearly defined, it may be of use following APA. The epidural catheter is another AUR risk factor, but it seems possible to withdraw the urinary catheter on postoperative D1, before the epidural catheter, provided that the other risk factors have been taken into full account.

This study was aimed at establishing a CUSUM learning curve for LSG in order to define the number of procedures needed to achieve sufficient surgical skill. All LSGs performed by a single general surgeon between September 2014 and November 2017 were considered. We hypothesized that the key t variables related to the LSG learning process (LP) are: operative time (OT), intraoperative complications or difficulties, need for expert assistance, length of hospital stay (LOS), and 3-month postoperative morbidity. All of these parameters are binary variables analyzed with the risk-adjusted CUSUM method. Two groups, learning group (LG) and experienced group (EG), were identified and compared by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the variables most closely associated with operative time and surgical success. One-year weight loss outcomes were likewise analyzed. One hundred and ten (110) consecutive LSGs were considered. CUSUM-LSG showed that the mean number of consecutive interventions necessary to reach proficiency in LSG was 58. In multivariate analysis, surgical success was negatively correlated with longer operative time and need for expert assistance. Body mass index was not correlated with surgical success.

These technical platforms are expensive, and consideration must be given to pooling of resources at the regional or national levels for the most sophisticated among them. The teaching is carried out with a set of synthetic or organic simulators. In accordance with European regulations, the use of animal models should be kept to a minimum. The use of human anatomical specimens is very useful for certain specialties and justifies the participation of anatomy and pathology laboratories in the training of young surgeons.

This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.

The curriculum now includes a practical training program by means of simulation outside the operating theater, and it is structured, uniformized and standardized nationwide. Development of this training program is derived from the deliberations of a national consensus panel working under the umbrella of the French college of visceral and digestive surgery, program presenting a training guide to all future surgeons in the specialty. Four consensus conference sessions bringing together an eight-member commission have led to the drafting of a \"Resident's manual for practical teaching in visceral and digestive surgery\". As a reference document, the manual details in 272 pages the objectives (phase I), the learning resources for each skill (phase II) and, lastly, the means of evaluation for the cornerstone phases as well as the in-depth phases of an advanced degree (DES) in visceral and digestive surgery.

Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system. It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient. Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis. The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.","218":"The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported. At first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect more than half of patients. The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and\/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images consistent with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopists may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.","219":null,"220":"In initial surgical formation and continuing surgical education, simulation has become a compulsory technique. Just as becoming an airplane pilot requires skills, the acquisition of technical skills is essential to becoming a surgeon. The old apprenticeship model \"I see, I do, and I teach\" is no longer entirely compatible with the socio-economic constraints of the operating room, demands for guaranteeing patient safety, and the compulsory reduction in resident working hours. We propose a new surgical simulation model, using cadavers donated to science that are rendered dynamic with pulsatile vascularization and ventilation. Such models are available for simulation of both open surgery and laparoscopy. Surgery on a human body donated to science makes it possible to accurately reproduce the hand gestures characteristic of surgical procedures. Learning in an appropriate and realistic simulation context increases the level of skills acquired by residents and reduces stress and anxiety when they come to perform real procedures.","221":"Skills other than technical or clinical competences are also recognized as essential in surgery. Most serious adverse events in health care are related to non-technical skill (NTS) failures. This has fostered interest in teaching surgeons about NTS. Reproducible evaluation scales, inspired by management strategies in the air transportation industry have been created in health care and some have been fashioned and validated specifically for surgeons. The list of NTS varies according to authors but one usually finds the same division into two main categories: social skills (communication, teamwork, leadership) and cognitive competences (situational awareness, decision-making). Stress and fatigue affect the implementation of these skills. Simulation is an efficient manner to teach NTS. The goals and exact modalities of how to teach NTS remains to be defined.","222":"The Covid-19 pandemic has markedly changed our practices.

Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.","223":"A 78-year-old patient had a massive small bowel bleeding on CT scan.

For each type of cancer-colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma-morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and\/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3-4 and\/or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections.

In this retrospective single-center study, 23 patients who underwent Malone's surgical treatment were analyzed. The main criteria were the usage of antegrade colonic enemas (ACE) after Malone's procedure at the most recent follow-up and comparison of quality of life scores before and after surgery. The post-procedure mortality was zero, but an overall morbidity of 60% was observed, including minor complications (Clavien 1, 2) in 56%. The median follow-up was 33 months. At the most recent follow-up, the utilization rate of the neo-appendicostomy for ACE was 69.6%; 76.9% of the patients using ACE reported improvement in quality of life scores. Secondary colostomy was performed in 21.7% for functional failure of the Malone procedure.

As concerns preoperative evaluation and work-up, echo-endoscopy aimed at clarifying lymph node status should be performed in all candidates for surgical resection and exploratory laparoscopy in cases of GA cT3\/T4 and\/or N+ for peritoneal carcinomatosis. On the other hand, PET-scan should not be performed systematically, but only when the other modalities for diagnosis prove insufficient. Laparotomy remains the route of choice to achieve total or partial gastrectomy with D2 lymph node lymphadenectomy for advanced lesions (&gt;T2N0). To limit the risk of dumping syndrome and esophageal reflux and as a way of reestablishing continuity, construction of a jejunal pouch on Roux-en-Y following total gastrectomy is recommended. In cases of peritoneal carcinosis in GA with a low peritoneal cancer index (PCI) (&lt;7) in a patient in good general condition whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, macroscopically complete cytoreduction with intraperitoneal hyperthermal chemotherapy will probably be required, and it will have to take place in an expert center.

Occupational hazard became a concern leading to standardized safety measures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the perceived level of information and protection among the non-medical caregivers involved in HIPEC and PIPAC in a high-volume center. All non-medical caregivers in the operating theatre of our institution were asked to answer a questionnaire between April and May 2018. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions and open questions structured in four parts: demographic variables, perceived level of information, perceived level of protection, interest in further education. Forty-nine caregivers agreed to answer the questionnaire. All identified IP chemotherapy as an occupational risk. Thirty-eight persons (77.55%) trusted the protective value of safety measures during HIPEC compared to 32 (65.3%) during PIPAC. A total of 29 persons (59.18%) used some of the measures while 16 (32.65%) used all of them. Main reasons of non-use were slips and lapses (7 persons) and lack of comfort (4 persons). A total of 34 caregivers considered the level of information about safety protocols as good or very good (69%). A total of 46 persons considered the level of protection as satisfying or excellent (93.87%). A total of 36 (73.47%) interviewees expressed the need of receiving more information. The present study shows that non-medical caregivers in the operating theatres are aware of the occupational hazards related to the use of IP chemotherapy. The use of protective measures is associated with decreased level of perceived risk. However there is a high need of continuous education on this subject for the involved personnel. ","247":"Nearly 5% of colorectal cancers are hereditary colorectal cancers, including adenomatous polyposis. The aim of this review was to highlight the current management of adenomatous polyposis. The two main genetic conditions responsible for adenomatous polyposis are familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (caused by an autosomal dominant mutation of the APC gene) and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) (caused by bi-allelic recessive mutations of the MUTYH (MutY human homolog) gene). FAP is characterized by the presence of &gt;1000 polyps and a young age at diagnosis (mean age of 10). In the absence of screening, the risk of colorectal cancer at age 40 is 100%. It is recommended to start screening at the age of 10-12 years. For patients with FAP and MAP, it is also recommended to screen the upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach and duodenum). In FAP, prophylactic surgery aims to reduce the risk of death without impairment of patient quality of life. The best age for prophylactic surgery is not well-defined; in Europe, prophylactic surgery is usually performed at age 20 as the risk of cancer increases sharply during the third decade. There are three main surgical procedures employed: total colectomy with an ileorectal anastomosis, restorative coloproctectomy with a J pouch anastomosis and coloproctectomy with a stoma. Restorative coloproctectomy with J pouch anastomosis is the reference procedure; however, disease can vary in severity from one patient to another and this must be taken into account to decide which procedure should be performed. In conclusion, the management of adenomatous polyposis is complex but is well-defined by guidelines, particularly in France.","248":"Fourteen to seventeen percent of patients suffering from colorectal cancer have synchronous liver metastases (sCRLM) at the time of diagnosis.

Patients treated for sCRLM between October 2000 and May 2015 were included. We defined three groups: (1) \"classic\": surgery of primary tumor and then surgery of sCRLM; (2) \"combined\": combined surgery of primary tumor and sCRLM: and (3) \"liver-first\": surgery of sCRLM and then surgery of primary tumor. During this period, 170 patients who underwent 209 hepatectomies were included (\"classic\": 149, \"combined\": 34, \"liver-first\": 26). The rate of severe complications was higher in the \"combined\" group compared to the \"classic\" group (35% vs. 12%, P=0.03), and the \"liver-first\" group (35% vs. 19%, P=0.25), while there were significantly fewer liver resections. Overall survival at 5 years in our cohort was 46%, without significant differences between the groups, and a median survival of 54 months. Recurrence-free survival of the patients in our cohort was 24% at 5 years, with a median survival time without recurrence of 14 months, without significant differences between the groups. All three strategies were feasible and there were no differences regarding overall and recurrence-free survivals between the three approaches. The \"combined\" strategy group had significantly more severe complications and did not provide better oncological results, despite less aggressive liver disease and more limited liver resections.

However, even if there are no CBSC at admission, 20% of patients still require delayed emergency surgery for peritonitis due to gastric perforation thus showing the limitations of this strategy in the diagnosis of irreversible gastric necrosis lesions. The aim of this study was to identify reliable computed tomography (CT) signs of irreversible gastric necrosis in patients with stage 3 endoscopic lesions. In a prospective study from March 2014 to January 2017, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed in 30 consecutive patients with stage 3 endoscopic gastric lesions. The CT results were concealed from the clinicians and compared to CBSC results. Twenty patients were treated conservatively and ten patients were operated on. Seventy percent of the patients underwent urgent delayed surgery for symptoms that developed late but before alterations in the CBSC. The CT scan showed a perfusion defect (PD) of gastric mucosal enhancement in all patients operated on for gastrointestinal distress, and could have provided an early diagnosis of irreversible gastric necrosis. CT was a more effective diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of irreversible gastric necrosis following caustic ingestion than a strategy based on digestive endoscopy and the use of CBSC. CT could eventually replace gastrointestinal endoscopy in the emergency evaluation of gastroesophageal caustic burns.

Prospective, non-comparative, multicenter French study. The primary endpoint was the specificity of PET\/CT for identifying malignant IPMN (in situ or invasive carcinoma). Final diagnosis was obtained from pathological examination of the resected specimen. Among 120 patients analyzed, 99 had confirmed IPMN, including 24 with malignant lesions, namely 9 with carcinoma in situ and 15 with invasive carcinoma. The 18F-FDG PET\/CT was positive in 44 and 31 patients in the overall and IPMN populations respectively. In the 99 IPMN patients, PET\/CT showed 13 true positive, 18 false positive, 57 true negative and 11 false negative results.

We investigated the rate of endoscopic closure in female patients undergoing groin hernia closure. A retrospective analysis of the data of patients undergoing elective groin hernia repair within a four-year period from 2013 to 2016 was performed. The rate of endoscopic hernia repair was calculated for both genders. Eight hundred and forty-six patients including 94 females and 752 males were included for analysis. The female group was significantly older compared to the male group (68.0 vs. 61.0 yrs, P=0.02). The rate of endoscopic groin hernia repair was significantly lower in the female group compared to in the male cohort (30% vs. 60%, P=0.001). The overall duration of surgery was 74.0min in the female cohort and 93.0min in the male group, P=0.001. However, there was no statistically significant difference amongst both groups with regard to the duration of surgery for endoscopic repair: 78.0min in the female group and 89.0min in the male group, P=0.67.

MS and NAFLD are implicated in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). At present, HCC and ICC involving MS represent 15-20% and 20-30% respectively of indications for hepatic resection in HCC and ICC.

MS patients combine the operative risk associated with their general condition and comorbidities and the risk associated with the presence and\/or severity of NAFLD. Following hepatic resection in cases of HCC and ICC complicating MS, the morbidity rate ranges from 20 to 30%, and due to cardiovascular and infectious complications, post-transplantation mortality is heightened. The operative risk incurred by MS patients necessitates appropriate management including: (i) precise characterization of the subjacent liver; (ii) an accurately targeted approach privileging detection and optimization of treatment taking into account the relevant cardiovascular risk factors; (iii) a surgical strategy adapted to the histology of the underlying liver, with optimization of the volume of the remaining (postoperative) liver.","264":null,"265":"","266":"Cytoreductive surgery of locally advanced ovarian cancer has evolved in the last few years from surgery to remove macroscopic residual disease (&lt;1cm; R2b) to macroscopic complete cytoreductive surgery with no gross residual disease (R1).

Endpoints studied were indications, intra and postoperative outcomes as well as short-term outcomes. A total of 46 patients (57 specimen resected) underwent a LLR during this period, representing 29.6% of total liver resections. Indications of LLR were benign lesions in 26%, primitive malignant lesions in 32.6% and metastatic tumours in 41.3%. Median size of lesions was 22mm (range 11-100).

Patients with complications tended to have a higher peritoneal cancer index (16 vs. 13; P=0.23). The performance of rectal resections was statistically significantly associated with morbidity (P=0.02). Neither performance of other type of resections nor the hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy compound nor the completeness of cytoreduction score was associated with elevated morbidity. No complications related to liver resections were observed. Furthermore, origin of peritoneal metastases did not impact on occurrence of complications. Median overall survival for colorectal primaries was 22 months (range, 9-60 months) and 30 months (range, 12-58 months) for ovarian cancer. Simultaneous resection of hepatic and peritoneal metastases seems to provide a survival benefit for selected patients and is associated with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Knowledge of patients and operative factors linked to morbidity will help to provide a strict selection process and a safer surgical procedure.

The goal of this study was to compare the current status of claims in two different French-speaking communities by a retrospective descriptive study of surgeons' experiences, from the beginning of their practice up until December 31 2014. Data included the number, the reasons, and the results of medicolegal claims and their jurisdictions. Forty-three surgeons participated in this study. Two hundred medicolegal claims were analyzed. The mean number was 5.8 per surgeon. Bariatric surgery, colorectal surgery and parietal surgery were the most exposed. Forty-six (23%) faults were noted, while no fault was pronounced in 139 (69.5%) cases. The main reasons for lodging complaints were nosocomial infections, anastomotic leaks, poor postoperative care, hollow organ perforation, peripheral neurologic complication, and insufficient preoperative information. Forty-four percent of the complaints were analyzed by the conciliation and compensation commissions and 43.5% by the High Court. In the French-speaking group, there were 13 complaints, two of which gave rise to compensation. French surgeons are highly exposed to complaints: in French law, clumsiness or technical maladdress is considered as a fault. The patient should be informed preoperatively of all possible severe risks of a medical procedure. In Belgium, complications are exceptional and are considered random therapeutic events. Adhering to the recommendations emanating from the French High Authority of Health and Learned Societies as well as accreditation issued by the same High Authority should allow to decrease the number of undesirable events related to care and malpractice.","310":"","311":"","312":"","313":"The safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is often questioned when newly implemented in an operating room (OR); as it may increase the risk of exposure to cytotoxics for healthcare workers.

We aimed to ensure the safety of PIPAC for surgeons and their co-workers for newly implemented procedures in an OR without laminar airflow. Twenty-six samples with cellulosic wipes from surgeons and co-workers' environmental items and 5 specific polytetrafluoroethylene air-filtered collections were randomly performed for the first 2 cisplatin\/doxorubicin-based PIPAC procedures in Strasbourg University Hospital. PIPAC was performed according to previously described safety protocol but without a laminar airflow and with an additional plastic cover and smoke evacuation device. Sampling and analyzes were performed by 2 accredited independent certified organizations. All air measurements were negative for cisplatin and doxorubicin. Only one wipe sample out of 26 was positive for cisplatin (4%) on the outer surgeon's pair of gloves but dosages on the surgeon's inner pair and hands were negative. When performed in approved security conditions, even without laminar airflow, PIPAC might seem harmless for surgeons and their co-workers with very limited risk of exposure to cytotoxics.

The two main causes are choledocholithiasis and neoplasia. Clinical diagnosis relies on Charcot's triad (pain, fever, jaundice) but the insufficient sensitivity of the latter led to the introduction in 2007 of a new score validated by the Tokyo Guidelines, which includes biological and radiological data. In case of clinical suspicion, abdominal ultrasound quickly explores the biliary tract, but its diagnostic capacities are poor, especially in case of non-gallstone obstruction, as opposed to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound, of which the diagnostic capacities are excellent. CT scan is more widely available, with intermediate diagnostic capacities. Bacteriological sampling through blood cultures (positive in 40% of cases) and bile cultures is essential. A wide variety of bacteria are involved, but the main pathogens having been found are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., justifying first-line antimicrobial therapy by a third-generation cephalosporin. Systematic coverage of Enterococcus spp. and anaerobic infections remains debated, and is usually recommended, in case of severity criteria for Enterococcus severity levels, or anaerobic bilio-digestive anastomosis for anaerobes. Presence of a biliary stent is the only identified risk-factor associated with infections by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Along with antimicrobial therapy, endoscopic or radiological biliary drainage is a crucial management component.

Patients undergoing emergency colectomy and\/or proctectomy with ERAS protocol from 2011 to 2017 a university hospital was reviewed. Clinical outcomes and ERAS compliance were analyzed and compared depending on whether there was IAI. This study included 60 patients; 14 (23%) had IAI. Median ERAS compliance was 75% (IQR: 63-83). Rates of overall complication and severe complication were 35% and 15%, respectively. The 60-day mortality was 6.7%. Median length of postoperative stay was 5days (IQR: 4-8). Thirty-three patients (55%) achieved targeted discharge within postoperative day 5. High adherence to ERAS protocol was associated with lower morbidity (P&lt;0.001) and shorter hospitalization (P=0.006).

This review of major reported series has made it possible to specify the indications for each surgical approach, as well as the advantages, disadvantages and complications of each one. The choice of surgical approach is determined by the nature of the RRT, its anatomical position relative to the middle of the third sacral vertebra (S3) and the presence or absence of invasion of the neighboring organs, the pelvis or sacral vertebrae. The abdominal route is chosen for tumors situated above the middle of S3, whether benign or malignant, but without invasion of neighboring organs. The perineal route is indicated for benign RRT situated below the middle of S3. The posterior route is chosen for tumors located below the middle of S3, and allows an associated resection of sacral segments in case of tumor invasion. The combined abdomino-sacral route is indicated for RRT above the middle of S3, when there is an invasion of a pelvic organ or a sacral vertebra.

Two visceral surgeons analyzed two hundred and thirty-one claims files. The patient's characteristics and data, the intervention, the source event of the claim, re-interventions, transfers, deaths and their causes were identified. Any error, whether it was identified by the expert or by the arbitration panel or court and vice versa was analyzed, including any amicable out-of-court agreement proposed by the insurance, even, if in certain cases, no real fault had been found. The mean age of the colon surgery patients was 62 years. The pathologies for which surgery was performed fell into three equal parts: colon cancer, sigmoid diverticulitis, and other pathologies.

While the majority of clinical forms are simple, there also exist complicated forms, involving extended intrahepatic lithiasis and its consequences: lithiasis migration, acute cholangitis, intrahepatic abscess. Chronic evolution can lead to secondary sclerosing cholangitis or secondary biliary cirrhosis. In unusual cases, degeneration into cholangiocarcinoma may occur. Treatment is built around ursodeoxycholic acid, which yields dissolution of biliary calculi. Complicated forms may call for interventional, radiological, endoscopic or surgical treatment.

A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients undergoing a LAERCP between February 2014 and May 2015 was performed at a single institution. Indications were common bile duct lithiasis associated with acute or past episodes of cholangitis and pancreatitis. Endoscopic access to the gastric remnant was obtained laparoscopically. In total 5 cases were identified. Four of them had undergone a RYGB and one of them presented a benign esophageal peptic stenosis, not allowing peroral gastric access. Biliary cannulation using LAERCP associated with sphincterotomy and stone extraction was successfully achieved in all patients. Mean duration of the entire procedure was 134minutes (range: 66-200min). No early major complications were observed and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (range: 2-5 days).

Secondarily, we assessed the impact of the RCPs on postoperative and oncological outcomes. All consecutive patients having undergone curative surgical excision for middle and low (subperitoneal) rectal cancer from 1995 to 2017 in the university hospital of Caen were included in accordance with the relevant French guidelines. They were divided into two groups: before (Gr1) and after (Gr2) 2006. For each group, a chart review was conducted on demographic variables, preoperative rectal tumor features, disease severity variables and quality of surgery variables. Postoperative and oncological outcomes were likewise assessed and compared between the two groups. Six hundred and four patients were included (Gr1, n=266; Gr2, n=338). Compliance with French guidelines significantly improved (i) use of magnetic resonance imaging (P&lt;0.0001) and CT-scan (P&lt;0.0001)]; (ii) organization of multidisciplinary tumor boards (P&lt;0.0001) leading to suitable neo-adjuvant treatment plan classification (P&lt;0.0001). Consequently, compliance improved widespread total mesorectal excision (P&lt;0.0001), sphincter-sparing surgery (P=0,0005), and completeness of curative resection in the specimen (P&lt;0.0001).

The objectives of this cohort study were to identify if patient, symptoms, or gallstone disease characteristics determined readmission in an unselected cohort with screen-detected gallstone disease and who had experienced a first admission with symptomatic gallstone disease. Data from three random sampled population-based cohorts were used. At baseline, participants were screened with ultrasound and 664 had gallstones of which 84 had a first admission without cholecystectomy performed. A cohort study was performed with follow-up up for hospital readmissions beyond 30 days through central registers. Age adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed. Readmissions occurred in 60.8% and cholecystectomy was eventually performed in 47.7% of patients. Early readmissions were determined by abdominal pain in the epigastrium (Hazard ratio (HR) 3.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.62;8.12]) and of moderate intensity (HR 2.71, 95% CI [1.20;6.16]). Late readmissions were determined by larger gallstone size, especially when above 10mm (HR 4.11, 95% CI [1.18;14.3]) and inversely determined by age (HR 0.97, 95% CI [0.95;0.998]). In patients with initially uncomplicated gallstone disease, cholecystectomy was inversely determined by age (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.93;0.98]). Once gallstones have become symptomatic and caused hospital admission, a persisting high risk for future readmission exists and half of patients end up having cholecystectomy.

The study population consisted of two groups: Uncomplicated Right Diverticulitis (URD) group (63.5%, (n=59)) and Complicated Right Diverticulitis (CRD) group (36.5%, [n=34]). 84.7% (n=50\/59) of URD were treated conservatively. 41.2% (n=14\/34) of patients with CRD had emergency surgery (mostly laparotomy) for Hinchey III peritonitis, clinical intolerance or hemodynamic instability. Altogether 5.2% (n=2\/34) patients with CRD had surgery after a cooling off period (initially abscess). The overall rate of severe postoperative complications was low (8%). Recurrence rate was low and comparable in both groups: 6.8% (n=4\/59) for URD and 8.8% (n=3\/34) for CRD, all recurrences occurred in the same locations with an uncomplicated form, 42.9% (n=3\/7) of them had elective laparoscopic surgery and the rest were conservatively treated. Median follow up was 33.2 months. Conservative treatment can be proposed safely and efficiently for URD and for selected patients with CRD. Surgery should be reserved for unstable patients or patients with severe forms of complicated diverticulitis in emergency.

The aim of this study was to analyze trends and outcomes in patients undergoing cholecystectomy with gallbladder related disease in France from 2008 to 2014. We carried out a population-based, retrospective cohort study using data extracted from the French nationwide hospital discharge database (PMSI). We included all patients having a cholecystectomy related to gallbladder disease from January 2008 to December 2014. Patients' demographics, primary diagnosis, procedure type, length of stay (LOS), admission in an intensive care unit, discharge disposition, complications, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Overall, 807,307 cholecystectomies were performed in France over the study period, with an increase in the national incidence rate from 167.5 (95%CI [166.5; 168.5]) to 182.6 (95%CI [181.6; 183.6]) per 100,000 inhabitants. Females accounted for 66.5% of procedures (P&lt;0.001). The mean age was lower for females than for males: 52.1 versus 60.2 (P&lt;0.001). The ratio of laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly increased from 90% in 2008 to 94% in 2014 (P&lt;0.001). Average inpatient LOS decreased significantly from 6.5 days in 2008 to 4.7 days in 2014 (P&lt;0.001). Most common complication type was intra-abdominal (23.1%) for laparoscopic procedure (95%CI [22.7; 23.5]), and in-hospital mortality significantly decreased over time from 0.45% in 2008 to 0.38% in 2014 (P&lt;0.005).

Classically described after high-velocity accidents, ruptures are often associated with multiple organ injuries. The diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The goal of this study was to analyze and to discuss the modalities of early radiologic diagnosis and management of these injuries. This multicenter retrospective study included patients seen between 2009 and 2017 within the Northern Alpine Emergency Network [REseau Nord Alpin des Urgences (RENAU)]. Clinical, radiologic and surgical data from all patients sustaining blunt diaphragmatic rupture were studied. Thirty-one patients (18 men and 13 women), median age 44, were included. The principle mechanism of injury was road or traffic accidents for 22 patients. Diaphragmatic rupture occurred on the left side in 23 patients. Diagnosis was delayed in two patients, at 11 days and three months after the initial accident. Chest X-rays were diagnostic in 18 of 29 patients. CT scan was the reference investigation since it was performed in all patients and confirmed the diagnosis in 26 instances. Repair was surgical via a midline laparotomy in 27 patients, via laparoscopy in three, and via thoracoscopy in one. Three patients died. At urgent surgical exploration in the unstable blunt trauma patient, the surgeon should keep in mind the relatively poor diagnostic performance of chest X-rays. Accurate diagnosis relies on routine inspection of the diaphragmatic cupolas.

The program's preoperative, perioperative and postoperative measures are implemented by the members of a motivated multidisciplinary team. Having shown its merits in digestive surgery, ERP would be particularly useful in liver surgery due to the elevated rates of morbidity and mortality this type of operation continues to entail. The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of ERP in liver surgery. This is a systematic narrative review of the literature on the efficacy of ERP in liver surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Notwithstanding a number of studies (n=30: 5 randomized trials, 14 cohort studies and 11 meta-analyses) less sizable than with regard to digestive surgery in general and colorectal surgery in particular, analysis of the literature confirms that in liver surgery, ERP is associated with an overall decrease in complications by 30 to 60%, but without improvement in the rates of hospital readmission and postoperative mortality. All of the studies report a reduction in average length of stay (ALOS) by 2.3 days and in functional recovery, a more objective indicator than ALOS, by 2.5 days. As of now, the economic impact of the ERP programs in liver surgery is neither positive nor negative, the above-mentioned savings being counterbalanced by heightened costs for material and equipment. Laparoscopic surgery is independently associated with better outcomes in terms of complications, functional recovery and ALOS; that is why it is important to incorporate this surgical approach in ERP as often as possible. Given a lack of robust evidence, Prehabilitation, which is a preoperative optimization process leading to improved functional reserve, has yet to be assigned a place in ERP programs pertaining to liver surgery. Possible roadblocks to application of an ERP program can be overcome through coordination by a team leader, a motivated multidisciplinary team, training courses and dedicated teaching sessions. ERP is a care improvement process that has a major play to play in organization of liver surgery, and its large-scale application is to be recommended.

Oncological treatment concerns an ever larger number of elderly patients, raising a number of not only practical and medical questions, but also the ethical interrogations associated with therapeutic decision-making, quality of life and therapeutic obstinacy (futile medical care). Surgeons are increasingly preoccupied by elderly patients on account of the cancer rate among them, and they are compelled to cope with challenges such as morbimortality and prolonged hospitalization. Geriatric oncology is a discipline of increasing importance of which the goal consists in comprehensive care of the elderly cancer patient, care taking into full account his physical and psychological aging, his somatic and cognitive comorbidities, and, last but least, his life expectancy. The opinions and recommendations of geriatric oncologists provide increasingly more orientation for the oncological therapeutic decision-making processes. The objective of this attempt at clarification is to discuss the contributions of this discipline to everyday surgical activity, to provide surgeons with some tools facilitating initial evaluation of their patients, and to remind the reader of situations in which oncological assistance is of paramount importance.","384":null,"385":"Acute pancreatitis is a frequent pathology with 11,000 to 13,000 new cases per year in France. A biliary origin (30 to 70% of the cases) should be suspected when alanine amino-transferases are elevated during the first 48 hours, and it is confirmed by the presence of gallstones at trans abdominal ultrasound. Abdominal computed-tomography scan is performed around the fifth day, and is repeated according to clinical and biological evolution. Management of acute biliary pancreatitis varies according to its severity, which should be assessed according to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and organ failures. For mild acute pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be performed during in-hospital stay, before oral feeding. For moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis, treatment is based on resuscitation, early enteral continuous feeding, and management of complications. Interval cholecystectomy is performed at a later stage. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy should be performed in emergency when angiocholitis is associated, and in delayed emergency before oral feeding for persistent common bile duct stone. A common bile duct stone should be searched for during cholecystectomy and can be treated during the same surgical procedure if local conditions are adequate.

The natural history of liver cysts is to increase in size and number, causing progressive disease that can lead to very large and incapacitating hepatomegaly. Only symptomatic hepatomegaly (pain, inability to eat, weight loss, dyspnea) or cystic complications such as infection or intracystic hemorrhage should be treated. The treatment of PLD thus covers a wide range of therapeutic options, ranging from non-intervention to liver transplantation, including needle aspiration evacuation with injection of sclerosant, laparoscopic fenestration and fenestration by laparotomy combined with liver resection. The choice between these different treatments depends on the symptomatology, the intrahepatic extension of the lesions and the patient's general condition. Hepatic resection is commonly chosen since the vast majority of PLD consists of multiple small cysts that are impossible or difficult to fenestrate. Since cysts are inhomogeneously distributed in the hepatic parenchyma with most areas less affected, the preservation of this less-involved territory allows liver regeneration relatively free of cysts. Hepatectomies for PLD are technically difficult because the planes and the vascular and biliary structures are compressed by the cysts. Liver transplantation, whether isolated or associated with renal transplantation, is indicated in cases of severe malnutrition and\/or end-stage renal disease or if the volume of remnant parenchyma is insufficient and suggests failure of a partial hepatectomy.","406":"","407":"Various procedures can promote hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) before major hepatectomy to prevent postoperative liver failure. The pathophysiological situation following portal vein embolization (PVE), hepatic artery ligation\/embolization or hepatectomy remains unclear. On one hand, the main mechanisms of hepatic regeneration appear to be driven by hepatic hypoxia (involving the hepatic arterial buffer response), an increased portal blood flow inducing shear stress and the involvement of several mediators (inflammatory cytokines, vasoregulators, growth factors, eicosanoids and several hormones). On the other hand, several factors are associated with impaired liver regeneration, such as biliary obstruction, malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, male gender, age, ethanol and viral infection. All these mechanisms may explain the varying degrees of hypertrophy observed following a surgical or radiological procedure promoting hypertrophy the FLR. Radiological procedures include left and right portal vein embolization (extended or not to segment 4), sequential PVE and hepatic vein embolization (HVE), and more recently combined PVE and HVE. Surgical procedures include associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy, and more recently the combined portal embolization and arterial ligation procedure.

However, functional intestinal sequelae, grouping together several symptoms known under the name of anterior resection syndrome (ARS), have emerged and become an increasingly frequent concern for both patients and physicians. The pathophysiology is complex: ARS is a combination in various degrees of stool frequency, incontinence for flatus and\/or stools, urgency, and disorders in discrimination and evacuation. The \"Low Anterior Resection Score\" (LARS), validated in 2012, is currently used to evaluate the severity of ARS and its impact on quality of life. While ARS can show improvement over the first two years, symptoms persist for longer than two years in nearly 60% of patients and in half of these patients, ARS is considered severe. The most frequently reported independent risk factors of severe ARS include neo-adjuvant radiation therapy, the extent of resection (total mesorectal excision that includes inter-sphincteric resection), absence of colonic pouch and anastomotic leak. In the absence of surgical complications and\/or local recurrence, physicians can draw from a wide therapeutic armamentarium in order to improve the functional outcome of patients, including diet and lifestyle modifications, gut motility regulators, multimodal rehabilitation (biofeedback, electro-stimulation) and sacral nerve modulation. Permanent colostomy is an alternative of last resort, proposed only when all other solutions fail. A better understanding of the natural history of ARS, its risk factors as well as the array of therapeutic alternatives should provide better patient information and optimize management.","409":null,"410":"Robotics has shown encouraging results for a number of technically demanding abdominal surgeries including pancreaticoduodenectomy, which has originally represented a relative contraindication to the application of the minimally-invasive technique.

All consecutive patients who underwent robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy were included in the present analysis. Perioperative, clinicopathologic and oncological outcomes were examined. In order to investigate the role of the learning curve, surgical outcomes were also used to compare the early and the late phase of our experience. A total of 59 patients underwent surgery.

Depending on the severity of malabsorption, it will lead to intestinal failure, defined as the reduction of gut function below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and\/or water and electrolytes, resulting in a situation where intravenous supplementation is required. The risk of developing intestinal failure is related to the remaining length of small intestine and the anatomy of the remnant bowel. SBS incidence has been estimated to range from 5 to 10 patients per year per million population. The main consequence of SBS is a marked reduction of intestinal absorption surface and its main complication is undernutrition and hydro-electrolytic abnormalities. Parenteral nutrition (PN), the major treatment of intestinal failure, has long-term complications. In case of PN dependency, treatment with trophic factors can be proposed. Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogs allow significant reduction of PN dependency and improve quality of life. Rehabilitative surgery should always be proposed, with the primary goal of restoring digestive continuity. Sometimes, an additional surgical procedure, such as an antiperistaltic reversal of a small bowel segment, is performed when restoring digestive continuity in patients with insufficient length of remnant small intestine to enhance the possibility of PN withdrawal.

Between January 2004 and December 2016, 21 patients with CD\/CS were treated with liver resection or transplantation (LTX) and post-operative data of patients with CD\/CS were retrospectively analysed in a database. Two patients underwent LTX, and 19 patients underwent liver resection due to CD\/CS. During follow-up, one patient developed lung cancer nine years after LTX. Patients resected due to CD\/CS were predominantly females (74%) with an overall low incidence of co-morbidities. The median post-operative Clavien-Dindo score was 1 (range: 0-3). There was no death during a median follow-up period of over five years. In four patients, cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed. Tumor recurrence was seen in three patients, and was treated with chemotherapy or repeated liver resection.

Obesity is responsible for a 20% loss of fertility but the effects of bariatric surgery on fertility are controversial. Nonetheless, in the light of progress in surgical techniques and better knowledge of gastro-intestinal disease the negative impact of surgery on fertility warrants attention. Effectively, fertility can be preserved after certain major gastro-intestinal operations such as cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal chemotherapy, total coloprotectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis and rectosigmoid resection, as long as the patient's age permits and resection of the reproductive organs is not necessary.","426":"","427":"Nodal involvement of the hepatic pedicle is variable and depends on the underlying hepato-bilio-pancreatic pathology.

Age, sex and associated treatments influence the risk of future subfertility. Certain chemotherapies (particularly alkylating agents) and radiotherapy fields that include the gonads or hypothalamopituitary axis may negatively impact the future fertility of patients. Evaluation of the gonadotoxic potential of therapeutic measures and the utilization of appropriate methods to preserve fertility require the combined efforts of a multidisciplinary team that includes pediatric oncologists, radiotherapists, surgeons, reproductive physicians and biologists and psychologists. Techniques for fertility preservation vary depending on the age of the child and range from surgical transposition of the gonads for pelvic radiotherapy to cryopreservation of the ovary or testicle in case of sterilizing chemotherapy. While scientists still do not yet fully understand the maturation of immature germ cells, these children will be seeking the assistance of Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP) in 20-30 years.

We performed a six-year retrospective study using the registry of the Northern French Alps trauma network (TRENAU). Consecutive patients who died in the prehospital field or within their stay at hospital were included. An adjudication committee analyzed deaths to identify preventable or potentially preventable deaths from 2009 to 2014. All errors were classified using the JCAHO taxonomy.

But for young patients with early stage disease, many recent studies have focused on preservation of subsequent fertility by keeping at least one ovary and the uterus. The main objective of this fertility-sparing surgery is to preserve fertility, if this can be accomplished without increasing the oncological risks. Whether the initial site of the cancer is the cervix, uterine fundus or ovary, the oncologic validation of fertility-sparing treatment requires several evaluation criteria: a rigorous clinical, radiological and surgical staging to verify that the pathology is truly at an early initial stage; expert pathologic interpretation of biopsy specimens to validate the histological criteria of \"good prognosis\"; provision of complete and understandable patient education verifying the true objectives for this fertility-sparing treatment (whose intent is to retain a potential for subsequent fertility without guaranteeing it) and provision of an explanation of the oncological constraints and implications of fertility-sparing surgery in the event of a possible pregnancy.

At 22:33 in the evening, a 19-ton truck drove into the crowd of holiday celebrators. The attack resulted in 458 wounded and 86 deaths. The purpose of this study was to describe the management of patients with abdominal trauma admitted alive in our institution, in the context of a massive influx of victims. We performed a retrospective analysis of the management of adults with abdominal trauma arising from the terrorist attack in Nice. Among the 182 victims admitted to our trauma center, eleven patients presented with abdominal trauma. The median age was 44 years [14-63] and the median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 34 [9-59]. Eight patients underwent urgent surgical treatment in the operating room including six for abdominal trauma. These patients were treated according to the principles of surgical damage control, albeit without the need for temporary abdominal closure or packing. Three patients could have had their lesions managed non-operatively had they been admitted outside this surge episode, which saturated the technical means of the receiving hospital. The terrorist attack that victimized the citizens of Nice resulted in the second largest number of dead of any attack on French soil. A large number of patients were admitted to the city's only center for adult trauma care. The management of these patients posed diagnostic, therapeutic and logistical problems. Increased use of pre-hospital pelvic restraint belts may help to reduce vehicular trauma. We do not feel that non-operative management of abdominal lesions can be envisaged in the context of a mass influx of victims. We recommend surgical hemostasis for patients with secondary hemorrhagic risk from visceral trauma in the context of a massive influx of victims. ","438":"Benign ovarian tumors occur in 7% of women during their procreative years and involve both organic and functional tumors. The average age of onset for borderline ovarian tumors is ten years younger than that for ovarian cancers. Women with benign and borderline malignant ovarian tumors are therefore more likely to be affected by fertility issues. The causal link between infertility and benign ovarian tumor stems more from the therapeutic strategies adopted than from the histological nature of the benign ovarian tumor. The question of fertility preservation must therefore be addressed in the management of these patients through respect for \"correct\" surgical indications, through gestures centered around ovarian preservation, and finally, if necessary, by recourse to fertility preservation techniques.","439":"Colorectal surgeons often participate in the multidisciplinary management of young females with endometriosis. Complications of endometriosis as well as its management often result in infertility since they can involve all pelvic organs including the procreative organs: uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Complete excision of all endometriotic lesions should not be performed at the expense of irreversible destruction of the procreative organs; definitive infertility should not be the price to pay in order to obtain an improvement of the painful symptoms caused by endometriosis. Surgery for ovarian endometriomas should be specifically adapted to the patient's desire for future conception and to her preoperative ovarian reserve. Two main techniques are used to treat ovarian endometriomas: ovarian cystectomy excises the wall of the cyst while ablation consists of destruction of the internal surface of the cyst. The use of mono polar or biolar coagulation for cyst ablation is strongly contra-indicated. Ablation using laser or plasma energy has resulted in comparable rates of post-operative pregnancy to those obtained by ovarian cystectomy. Patients who wish to delay their attempt to conceive for some period of time, should be placed on long-term oral contraception with prevention of menstruation to reduce the risk of recurrent endometriosis. When surgery for colorectal endometriosis is necessary, the laparoscopic approach increases the chances of spontaneous conception compared to laparotomy. Surgery for deep-seated endometriosis has been accompanied by a high rate of spontaneous conception and successful pregnancy and does not seem to decrease the chances for conception by in vitro fertilization.","440":null,"441":"","442":null,"443":null,"444":"The indications for use of biological mesh prostheses are very limited because of their high cost, but include parietal repair in a contaminated setting.

In the early post-operative period, 22 (32.3%) of patients presented with wall abscess; eight (11.7%) underwent surgical revision and seven (10.2%) underwent interventional radiological drainage. In the medium term, 41\/56 (73%) had a late complication; 32 (57%) of the patients developed recurrent herniation and 15 (26.7%) of them were re-operated. In addition, nine (16%) of patients developed a late surgical site infection and eight (14.2%) a chronic residual infection. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for recurrence were parastomal hernia (P=0.007) and a history of recurrent hernia (P=0.002). A majority of patients developed recurrent incisional herniation in the medium term. This puts the use of biological prostheses into question.

The purpose of this review is to review the literature on methods of pre-operative skin preparation for the prevention of SSI in abdominal surgery. In order to obtain the best level of evidence, only meta-analyses and randomized controlled clinical trials were selected from the Cochrane Library and PubMed databases. High-powered non-randomized studies were included when results were not available for the questions asked. The primary endpoint was the rate of SSI within 30 days. Analysis of the 20 selected studies suggested that hair removal in the operative field is not recommended except when it interferes with surgery; in this case, hair clipping or chemical depilation is recommended and shaving should be banned. For the pre-operative shower, the choice of a detergent product with or without antiseptic does not seem to matter, and there were no published data on the required number of showers or the interval before surgery. Application of an alcohol-based solution to the operative field for cutaneous disinfection is recommended; the products used seem to be equivalent, and there is no need for pre-operative detergent scrubbing. There is no strong evidence to recommend adhesive plastic drapes for clean or contaminated surgery. Some recommendations on skin preparation before abdominal surgery to reduce the rate of SSI are based on a high level of evidence. Other recommendations such as the number and duration of pre-operative showers or use of adhesive plastic skin drapes are less well supported.

Postoperative mortality, morbidity, overall and disease-free survival, univariate analysis of prognostic factors on survival was analyzed. Among 66 surgical procedures in 64 patients included in the study, 41 were BCLC stage 0\/A (62.1%) and 25 BCLC stage B (37.9%). The overall 30- and the 90-days mortality rates were 1.5% and 3%. Patients in BCLC stage B had higher transfusion rate (P=0.04) but similar morbidity and mortality compared to patients in BCLC stage 0\/A.

From January 2017 to June 2017, all patients referred for consultation for hepatobiliary or pancreatic pathology were included in this new management pathway. Data were collected prospectively in a standardized form. Fifty-six patients with hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease were evaluated in the program during dedicated slots over a total of 20 days. Of these, four patients underwent evaluation in the program twice. The average number of patient slots in the program was three per day (range: 1-5).

This mandates initial laparotomy for abdominal wounds, extra-peritoneal packing (EPP) and resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) in the emergency room for pelvic wounds, insertion of temporary vascular shunts (TVS) for proximal limb injuries, ligation for distal vascular injuries, and control of exteriorized extremity bleeding with a tourniquet, compressive or hemostatic dressings for bleeding at the junction or borderline between two compartments, as appropriate.

Initially described as damage control surgery (DCS) for war-wounded patients with abdominal penetrating hemorrhagic trauma, this concept is articulated in three steps: surgical control of lesions (hemostasis, sealing of intestinal spillage), physiological restoration, then surgery for definitive repair. This concept was quickly adapted for intensive care management under the name damage control resuscitation (DCR), which refers to the modalities of hospital resuscitation carried out in patients suffering from traumatic hemorrhagic shock within the context of DCS. It is based mainly on specific hemodynamic resuscitation targets associated with early and aggressive hemostasis aimed at prevention or correction of the lethal triad of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulation disorders. Concomitant integration of resuscitation and surgery from the moment of admission has led to the concept of an integrated DCR-DCS approach, which enables initiation of hemostatic resuscitation upon arrival of the injured person, improving the patient's physiological status during surgery without delaying surgery. This concept of DC is constantly evolving; it stresses management of the injured person as early as possible, in order to initiate hemorrhage control and hemostatic resuscitation as soon as possible, evolving into a concept of remote DCR (RDCR), and also extended to diagnostic and therapeutic radiological management under the name of radiological DC (DCRad). DCS is applied only to the most seriously traumatized patients, or in situations of massive influx of injured persons, as its universal application could lead to a significant and unnecessary excess-morbidity to injured patients who could and should undergo definitive treatment from the outset.

The principles of wound ballistics are based on the interaction between the projectile and the human body as well as the transfer of energy from the projectile to tissues. The treatment of ballistic wounds relies on several principles: extremity wound debridement and absence of initial closure, complementary medical treatment, routine immobilization, revision surgery and secondary closure. Victims of explosions usually present with a complex clinical picture since injuries are directly or indirectly related to the shock wave (blast) originating from the explosion. These injuries depend on the type of explosive device, the environment and the situation of the victim at the time of the explosion, and are classed as primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary. Secondary injuries due to flying debris and bomb fragments are generally the predominant presenting symptoms while isolated primary injuries (blast) are rare. The resulting complexity of the clinical picture explains why triage of these victims is particularly difficult. Certain myths, such as inevitable necrosis of the soft tissues that are displaced by the formation of the temporary cavitation by the projectile, or sterilization of the wounds by heat generated by the projectile should be forgotten.

Prevalence of ADM in cholecystectomy specimens is estimated between 1% and 9% with a balanced sex ratio; the incidence increases after the age of 50. ADM, although usually asymptomatic, can manifest as abdominal pain or hepatic colic, even in the absence of associated gallstones (50% to 90% of cases). ADM can also be revealed by an attack of acalculous cholecystitis. Pre-operative diagnosis is based mainly on ultrasound (US), which identifies intra-parietal pseudo-cystic images and \"comet tail\" artifacts.

After ureteral resection, two types of reconstruction are possible: uretero-ureteral end-to-end anastomosis and uretero-vesical re-implantation or uretero-neocystostomy (the so-called psoas hitch technique). By compiling the experience of three surgical teams that perform HIPEC surgeries, we have tried to compare the effectiveness of these two techniques. A retrospective comparative case-matched multicenter study was conducted for patients undergoing operation between 2005 and 2014. Patients included had undergone resection of the pelvic ureter during cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatomosis; ureteral reconstruction was by either end-to-end anastomosis (EEA group) or re-implantation uretero-neocystostomy (RUC group). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of urinary fistula in postoperative follow-up. There were 14 patients in the EEA group and 14 in the RUC group. The groups were comparable for age, extent of carcinomatosis (PCI index) and operative duration. Four urinary fistulas occurred in the EEA group (28.5%) versus zero fistulas in the RUC group (0%) (P=0.0308). Re-implantation with uretero-neocystostomy during cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC is the preferred technique for reconstruction after ureteral resection in case of renal conservation.

The lifetime risk of related complications is estimated at 4%. These include gastro-intestinal bleeding, obstruction or diverticular inflammation. Diagnosis is difficult and rarely made, and imaging, especially in the case of complicated disease, is often not helpful; however exploratory laparoscopy is an important diagnostic tool. The probability of onset of complication decreases with age, and the diagnosis of MD in the adult is therefore often incidental. Resection is indicated in case of complications but remains debatable when MD is found incidentally. According to an analysis of large series in the literature, surgery is not indicated in the absence of risk factors for complications: these include male gender, age younger than 40, diverticulum longer than two centimetres and the presence of macroscopically mucosal alteration noted at surgery. Resection followed by anastomosis seems preferable to wedge resection or tangential mechanical stapling because of the risk of leaving behind abnormal heterotopic mucosa.","529":"","530":"Peritoneal encapsulation (PE) is a rare congenital anomaly that is formed due to an accessory peritoneal layer encapsulating the small bowel. Kinking of bowel within the accessory peritoneal layer or adhesions between the bowel loops and the peritoneal layer causes symptoms ranging from colicky abdominal pain to rarely intestinal obstruction. Cleland was the first person to have reported this condition as early as 1868 and since then only around 30 cases have been reported. Here, we present a case of acute intestinal obstruction in a 22-year-old woman. Imaging showed dilated bowel loops confined to the centre of the peritoneal cavity. Intraoperatively it was seen to be a case of peritoneal encapsulation. The small intestine was freed and accessory layer excised. This report is to demonstrate this rare congenital anomaly.","531":"","532":"","533":"Operative injury to the hepatic artery is a serious complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy and guidelines to manage this complication are lacking. A systematic search performed in PubMed database identified eleven studies overall including 20 patients having sustained injury to the hepatic artery during pancreaticoduodenectomy (n=18) or total pancreatectomy (n=2). One further unpublished personal observation following pancreaticoduodenectomy was also included. Sixteen of 21 patients (76%) experienced serious complications including liver necrosis\/abscess (n=14), acute liver failure (n=3), and biliary anastomotic dehiscence (n=6). Eleven patients (52%) were reoperated and 5 patients died (24%). Arterial injury was recognized and repaired immediately in five patients, four recovering uneventfully and one dying from acute liver failure (20%). In contrast delayed or conservative treatment in 16 patients was associated with serious early morbidity in 15 patients (94%), leading to death in 4 patients and late biliary complications in four others. Accidental interruption of arterial flow to the liver during pancreaticoduodenectomy often results in serious short and long-term consequences. Immediate restoration of arterial flow is indicated whenever technically feasible and may prevent early life-threatening complications as well as late biliary stenosis.

Indeed, trainee surgeons have limited access to LCS as primary operator, and ERP have improved patients' outcomes in colorectal surgery (CS). All residents of our department were trained in a simulation-based CPA: perioperative training consisted in virtual patients built according to guidelines in both ERP and CS, whilst intraoperative training involved a virtual reality simulator curriculum. Twenty consecutive patients undergoing CS were prospectively included before (n=10) and after (n=10) the training. All demographic and perioperative data were prospectively collected, including compliance for ERP. Residents' participation as primary operator in LCS was measured. Five residents (PGY 4-7) were enrolled. None had performed LCS as primary operator. Overall satisfaction and usefulness were both rated 4.5\/5, usefulness of pre-, post- and intraoperative training was rated 5\/5, 4.5\/5 and 4\/5, respectively. Residents' participation in LCS significantly improved after the training (0% (0-100) vs. 82.5% (10-100); P=0.006). Pre- and intraoperative data were comparable between groups. Postoperative morbidity was also comparable. Compliance for ERP improved at Day 2 in post-training patients (3 (30%) vs. 8 (80%); P=0.035). Length of stay was not modified. A simulated CPA curriculum to training in LCS and ERP was correctly implemented. It seemed to improve compliance for ERP, and promoted residents participation as primary operator without adversely altering patients' outcomes. ","537":"","538":"Multimodal therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery have been shown to be feasible and to have a positive impact on outcomes by decreasing the risk of locoregional recurrence and often by increasing overall survival. The advantages of neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy include optimal tumor control combined with better tolerance and compliance to treatment while also increasing the number of candidates for surgery. Whereas indications for neoadjuvant therapy are increasing, its impact on surgical treatment and postoperative outcomes are not well-known. Surgeons frequently believe that chemo(radio)therapy may amplify intraoperative difficulties, thereby increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review was to report the state of the art regarding: (i) the role of chemo(radio)therapy; (ii) its impact on surgical indications and modalities; and (iii) its impact on postoperative outcomes for the most frequently encountered gastro-intestinal cancers, i.e. esophageal, rectal, pancreatic, and anal canal cancer.","539":"Total thyroidectomy for substernal goiter occasionally requires a sternotomy associated with a cervical incision. We sought to analyze the postoperative complications of thyroidectomy for substernal goiters in our center and more precisely the complications related to the sternotomy. All patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for substernal goiter in our center between 2007 and 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with combined cervical incision and sternotomy (ST group, n=16) were compared to those with cervical incision alone (CT group, n=54), with regard to postoperative complications. Risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative complications were investigated in this population. A total of 24 patients (34.2%) had one or more postoperative complications. The incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury were higher in the ST group (P=0.001 and P=0.052, respectively). The median duration of hospitalization was longer in the ST group (P&lt;0.001). Eighteen patients (25.8%) had a malignant tumor on final pathology. In univariate analysis, the following risk factors for transient postoperative hypoparathyroidism were identified: sternotomy, preoperative symptomatic character and thyroid height (P=0.001, P=0.009 and P=0.013, respectively). In multivariable analysis, only sternotomy was an independent risk factor for postoperative transient hypoparathyroidism (OR=4.48 [1.1; 18], P=0.035). Sternotomy is associated with added morbidity that is not negligible. This surgical approach should be reserved for substernal goiters that descend into the posterior mediastinum, below the level of the aortic arch, when there is suspicion of carcinoma with loco-regional invasion, or when the thyroid tissue is located mainly intrathoracically (conical shaped thyroid, asymptomatic goiter, ectopic thyroid).","540":"","541":"","542":"","543":"Congenital porto-caval shunt is a rare anomaly that can result in direct shunt-related complications (encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension) or indirect complications such as the development of benign or malignant hepatic neoplasms.

This stratification is needed to customize the choice of hemodynamic support that is best adapted to the patient's level of risk, integrating the use of the least invasive procedures. The macro-circulatory hemodynamic approach aims to maintain a balance between oxygen supply (DO2) and oxygen demand (VO2). Volume replacement plays a crucial role based on the titration of fluid boluses according to their effect on measured stroke volume or indices of preload dependency. Good function of the microcirculatory system is the best guarantee to achieve this goal. An assessment of the DO2\/VO2 ratio is needed for guidance in critical situations where tissue hypoxia may occur. Overall, all of these strategies are based on objective criteria to guide vascular replacement and\/or tissue oxygenation in order to improve the patient's post-operative course by decreasing morbidity and hospital stay.","556":"","557":"","558":"","559":"","560":"Although we have seen revolutionary changes with multi-disciplinary management of patients with rectal cancer, the evaluation of genito-urinary sequelae remains of great concern. Precise pre-operative evaluation with validated scores allows detection of urinary disorders in 16 to 23% of patients, and sexual disorders in nearly 35% of men and 50% of women. Regardless of the surgical approach, it is fundamental to respect the autonomic innervation during total mesorectal excision in order to prevent these sequelae. Identification of these nerves can be facilitated by intra-operative neuro-stimulation. In spite of these precautions, de novo urinary sequelae are observed in nearly 33% of patients and bladder evacuation disorders in 25% of patients. Advanced age, pre-operative urinary disorders, female gender, and abdomino-perineal resection are independent risk factors for urinary sequelae. Early post-operative urodynamic abnormalities might be predictive of these sequelae and justify early physiotherapy. Likewise, sexual sequelae such as erectile and\/or ejaculatory disorders, dyspareunia and lubrication deficits result in de novo cessation of sexual activity in 28% of men and 18% of women. Advanced age, neo-adjuvant radiation therapy, and abdomino-perineal resection are independent risk factors for sexual dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy with sildenafil has proven useful in the treatment of erectile disorders.

Prognosis is directly related to the degree and duration of intestinal ischemia. Our goal is to describe our experience with TSIVM in the adult, to identify any specific findings and to discuss its management. Eleven patients who had undergone surgery for TSIVM at three centers between 1992 and 2012 were included. Surgery was performed as an emergency for five patients and surgery was elective for six. Mean follow-up was 63 months (range: 12-270). Six patients had had previous abdominal surgery. In nine cases, the diagnosis of TSIVM was made preoperatively, mainly by CT scan in eight cases. Seven patients had associated congenital failure of retroperitoneal fixation of the right colon and all of these underwent a Ladd procedure. The mortality rate was zero. Of the five patients who underwent emergency surgery, three required intestinal resections, one of whom developed a short bowel syndrome. The six patients who underwent surgery electively had no surgical complications. TSIVM is a very unusual finding in adult patients. The diagnosis can be made by CT scan with IV and oral contrast, but it often comes to light only at the time of surgery, even though the patients have often had recurrent episodes of abdominal symptomatology that dated back to childhood. The Ladd procedure, consisting of division of Ladd's bands, widening of the mesentery, and incidental appendectomy, remains the standard surgical repair. Digestive surgeons who care for adults should be familiar with this procedure, and it should be performed, as often as possible, with the assistance of a pediatric surgeon. ","570":"","571":"Internal rectal prolapse (IRP) is a well-recognized pelvic floor disorder mainly seen during defecatory straining. The symptomatic expression of IRP is complex, encompassing fecal continence (56%) and\/or evacuation disorders (85%). IRP cannot be characterized easily by clinical examination alone and the emergence of dynamic defecography (especially MRI) has allowed a better comprehension of its pathophysiology and led to the proposition of a severity score (Oxford score) that can guide management. Decision for surgical management should be multidisciplinary, discussed after a complete work-up, and only after medical treatment has failed. Information should be provided to the patient, outlining the goals of treatment, the potential complications and results. Stapled trans-anal rectal resection (STARR) has been considered as the gold standard for IRP treatment. However, inconsistent results (failure observed in up to 20% of cases, and fecal incontinence occurring in up to 25% of patients at one year) have led to a decrease in its indications. Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy has substantial advantages in solving the functional problems due to IRP (efficacy on evacuation and resolution of continence symptoms in 65-92%, and 73-97% of patients, respectively) and is currently considered as the gold standard therapy for IRP once the decision to operate has been made.","572":"Serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) that exceeds a pre-defined threshold between the 3rd and 5th postoperative day is a reliable marker of infectious complications after colorectal surgery. However, the optimal strategy to follow when a high CRP is found has not been defined. The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of computed tomography (CT) scan in this situation in a prospective cohort of patients following colorectal surgery. Between November 2011 and April 2015, patients at two surgical centers who had undergone elective colorectal resection with anastomosis and who had a CRP&gt;12.5mg\/dL on the 4th postoperative day (POD) were prospectively included in a database. Data were collected concerning all complications occurring during the 30days following surgery, method of diagnosis, management and clinical course. The decision to perform a CT scan between POD 4 and POD 6 day was guided only by the elevation of CRP in the absence of any other clinical signs; results were analyzed to evaluate the diagnostic value of elevated CRP. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to identify risk factors for postoperative infection. The study included a total of 174 patients: 56 (32.1%) had a CT between POD 4 and 6, and this helped detect a postoperative complication in 55.4% of cases. Patients who did not undergo CT had lower CRP values (16.3 vs. 18.5, P=0.02). Among the 118 patients who did not undergo CT, 50.8% eventually developed an infectious complication. The sensitivity of CRP-guided CT was 76.7% with a negative predictive value of 78.8%. If an elevated CRP is found on POD 4, an abdominopelvic CT should be performed. A normal result does not formally eliminate the existence of intra-abdominal complication. A study protocol should be set up to evaluate whether systematic revisional surgery or repeat CT scan is the appropriate management if CRP in the next two days reveals persistent inflammation.

Our study was multicentric and retroprospective from January, 2010 to September, 2013. Patients presenting with a penetrating abdominal stab wound (SW) or gunshot wound (GSW) were included in the study. Those with signs of acute abdomen or hemodynamic instability had immediate surgery. Patients who were hemodynamically stable had a CT scan with contrast. If no intra-abdominal injury requiring surgery was evident, patients were observed. Criteria evaluated were failed NOM and its morbidity, rate of non-therapeutic procedures (NTP) and their morbidity, length of hospital stay and cost analysis. One hundred patients were included in the study. One patient died at admission. Twenty-seven were selected for NOM (20 SW and 7 GSW). Morbidity rate was 18%. Failure rate was 7.4% (2 patients) and there were no mortality. Seventy-two patients required operation of which 22 were NTP. In this sub-group, the morbidity rate was 9%. There were no mortality. Median length of hospital stay was 4 days for the NOM group and 5.5 days for group requiring surgery. Cost analysis showed an economic advantage to NOM. Implementation of NOM of penetrating trauma is feasible and safe in France. Indications may be extended even for some GSW. Clinical criteria are clearly defined but CT scan criteria should be better described to improve patient selection. NOM reduced costs and length of hospital stay.

However, there is some doubt as to their feasibility and efficacy in the elderly. Our goal was to systematically review the evidence-based literature concerning the feasibility of ERP in elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The PubMed and Cochrane Database for systematic reviews as well as the \"grey\" literature between 2000 and 2015 were sought. Articles were selected if they compared ERP in elderly patients to ERP in young patients (feasibility) or compared ERP to traditional post-operative management in the elderly (efficacy). Sixteen articles were identified according to the inclusion criteria. All showed that an ERP was feasible in the elderly although post-operative morbidity was higher compared to younger patients. Compared to traditional management, ERP was effective since it decreased (as in the young) the overall rate of complications and thus the duration of hospital stay. There were not enough data on the degree of implementation of ERP and the medico-economic aspects to come to any formal conclusions. This comprehensive systematic review of the literature showed that ERP was feasible and effective in the elderly undergoing colorectal surgery.

Data from the literature are in agreement, emphasizing that, in this clinical pathway, the patient has thus become an actor in his own care, whose active participation is paramount to the success of the program. In parallel with this, a spirit of teamwork is required and the program contributes substantially to cohesion within the team.

The best identified risk factors for pain chronicity are the presence of pain pre-operatively, pre-operative opioid use, and the intensity of post-operative pain. Ideal management of peri-operative pain in 2015 aims to optimize post-operative pain management, to detect the risk of pain chronicity begins pre-operatively with early detection of risk factors for chronicity. In terms of treatment, the systematic and generous use of morphine has shown its limitations, particularly due to reduced efficacy for movement-related pain. Meanwhile, opioid side effects can be very debilitating for the patient, leading to delay in post-operative rehabilitation, a dose-dependent hyperalgesic effect resulting in both acute and chronic pain, immune modulation that may have a deleterious impact on infectious complications or cancer [1], and, finally, some question of possible neurotoxicity. Therefore, modern analgesia depends on both intra-operative and post-operative morphine sparing. The goal at the present time is to obtain optimal analgesia that allows rapid rehabilitation without sequelae or chronicity through the use of drugs and\/or techniques to avoid the need for opioid medications.","584":"The prevention of post-operative risk of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is of fundamental importance, but preventive methods have progressed with the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), the development of ambulatory surgery and enhanced recovery programs (ERP) after surgery. Surgery is, inherently a trigger for venous thrombo-embolic disease, as is prolonged immobilization. However, the risk of VTE is very low following ambulatory surgery, especially in this selected population. ERP, consists of a set of measures to optimize the patient's peri-operative management while reducing length of stay, costs and morbidity and mortality; one measure is the encouragement of early ambulation. This will undoubtedly have an impact on the incidence of VTE and lessen the need for prolonged thrombo-prophylaxis.","585":"Post-operative cerebral dysfunction includes delirium, usually occurring early and reversible, and post-operative cognitive disorders, usually occurring later and prolonged. This is a frequent complication in patients older than 75 years old. The two neurological pictures are often inter-related. The pathophysiology of both entities is similar and related to post-operative neuro-inflammation; therefore onset may occur independently of any surgical complication. Post-operative cerebral dysfunction is a serious organic complication. Reduction of inflammation represents the most logical preventive measure but currently there are no studies that show this to be effective. Prevention therefore means combining several minor measures, elements that fit well into programs of enhanced post-operative recovery after surgery. Diminished pre-operative cognitive status being a major risk factor, pre-operative rehabilitation combining nutritional, physical and cognitive support can be helpful.","586":"Outpatient left colectomy has been described in several small series or case reports.

They all underwent surgery following the same outpatient management protocol. After discharge, patients were followed by home health nurses with surgeon follow-up visits on days 10 and 21 (D10, D21) or earlier, if necessary. During this period, 56 patients underwent a left colectomy, 47 of whom met the inclusion criteria. Seven patients refused the outpatient care approach, leaving a total of 40 patients included (8 ASA 3 [American Society of Anesthesiologists], 24 ASA 2, 8 ASA 1).

Abbreviated laparotomy is a surgical strategy that forgoes the completeness of operation in favor of a physiological approach, the overriding preference going to rapidity and limiting the procedure to control the injuries. Management is based on sequential association of the shortest possible preoperative resuscitation with surgery limited to essential steps to control injury (stop the bleeding and contamination), without definitive repair. The latter will be ensured during a scheduled re-operation after a period of resuscitation aiming to correct physiological abnormalities induced by the trauma and its treatment. This strategy necessitates a pre-defined plan and involvement of the entire medical and nursing staff to reduce time loss to a strict minimum. ","612":"For the last 20 years, nonoperative management (NOM) of blunt hepatic trauma (BHT) has been the initial policy whenever this is possible (80% of cases), i.e., in all cases where the hemodynamic status does not demand emergency laparotomy. NOM relies upon the coexistence of three highly effective treatment modalities: radiology with contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) and hepatic arterial embolization, intensive care surveillance, and finally delayed surgery (DS). DS is not a failure of NOM management but rather an integral part of the surgical strategy. When imposed by hemodynamic instability, the immediate surgical option has seen its effectiveness transformed by development of the concept of abbreviated (damage control) laparotomy and wide application of the method of perihepatic packing (PHP). The effectiveness of these two conservative and cautious strategies for initial management is evidenced by current experience, but the management of secondary events that may arise with the most severe grades of injury must be both rapid and effective. ","613":"","614":"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) play an important role in the treatment of post-operative pain, particularly in the context of enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery. Several recent articles have suggested that NSAID may have a deleterious effect on colo-colic or colo-rectal anastomoses. The aim of this review is to analyze the evidence based on meta-analyses and cohort studies in the literature. A systematic review of clinical studies identified twelve studies including two meta-analyses and ten comparative cohort studies that included a large number of patients. The data in these studies are heterogeneous, often biased, and do not permit a formal recommendation based on a high level of evidence. The main conclusion of this review is that the balance of benefit vs. risk (analgesic effect\/risk of anastomotic disruption) is acceptable; it appears (with a low level of evidence) that a prescription of NSAID for 48h after surgery may be recommended for elective colon surgery. Nevertheless, it is important to respect the specific contra-indications of NSAID and avoid post-operative NSAID use if there are risk factors for anastomotic leakage: advanced age, malnutrition, severe co-morbidities, intra-operative difficulties.

Surveillance using text messages (TM) has been validated for minor operations in ambulatory surgery. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of home surveillance by TM after colorectal surgery within an ERP. This prospective multicenter study involved the University hospitals of Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble, Marseille and Lyon Sud between November 2014 and September 2015. All patients underwent colorectal surgery within an ERP. Post-discharge, patients received TM (4 simple questions with regard to pain, bowel movements, temperature and phlebitis) on days 1, 3 and 5. If there was abnormal or lack of response, an automatic alert was sent to the attending physician via Internet and the patient was contacted immediately. One hundred and eleven patients were included. Responses were obtained within a median of 12 (1-422) minutes, and 90% of patients answered all TM. There were 48 alerts: 56% because of pain and 40% due to absence of response to the TM. Alerts led to in-hospital care for 4% of patients including three re-hospitalizations and two unplanned re-operations. The median satisfaction score (85% of patients responded) was 5 on a scale of 1 to 5. This study suggests the possibility, as for ambulatory surgery, to use test messaging for post-discharge home surveillance for patients undergoing colorectal surgery within an ERP. ","619":"The spleen and pancreas are at risk for injury during abdominal trauma. The spleen is more commonly injured because of its fragile structure and its position immediately beneath the ribs. Injury to the more deeply placed pancreas is classically characterized by discordance between the severity of pancreatic injury and its initial clinical expression. For the patient who presents with hemorrhagic shock and ultrasound evidence of major hemoperitoneum, urgent \"damage control\" laparotomy is essential; if splenic injury is the cause, prompt \"hemostatic\" splenectomy should be performed. Direct pancreatic injury is rarely the cause of major hemorrhage unless a major neighboring vessel is injured, but if there is destruction of the pancreatic head, a two-stage pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) may be indicated. At open laparotomy when the patient's hemodynamic status can be stabilized, it may be possible to control splenic bleeding without splenectomy; it is always essential to search for injury to the pancreatic duct and\/or the adjacent duodenum. Pancreatic contusion without ductal rupture is usually treated by drain placement adjacent to the injury; ductal injuries of the pancreatic body or tail are treated by resection (distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy), with generally benign consequences. For injuries of the pancreatic head with pancreatic duct disruption, wide drainage is usually performed because emergency PD is a complex gesture prone to poor results. Postoperatively, the placement of a ductal stent by endoscopic retrograde catheterization may be decided, while management of an isolated pancreatic fistula is often straightforward. Non-operative management is the rule for the trauma victim who is hemodynamically stable. In addition to the clinical examination and conventional laboratory tests, investigations should include an abdominothoracic CT scan with contrast injection, allowing identification of all traumatized organs and assessment of the severity of injury. In this context, non-operative management (NOM) has gradually become the standard as long as the patient remains hemodynamically stable and there is no suspicion of injury to hollow viscera, with the patient being carefully monitored on a surgical service. The development of arteriography with splenic artery embolization has increased the rate of splenic salvage; this can be performed electively based on specific indications (blush on CT, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula), and may also be considered for severe splenic injury, abundant hemoperitoneum, or severe polytrauma. For pancreatic injury, in addition to CT scan, magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRCP) or even endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be necessary to identify a ductal rupture. If the pancreatic duct is intact, laboratory and CT imaging surveillance is performed just as for splenic injury. In case of pancreatic ductal injury, ERCP stenting can be considered. However, if this is unsuccessful, the therapeutic decision can be difficult: while NOM can still be successful, complications may arise that are difficult to treat while distal pancreatectomy, although initially more agressive may avoid these complications if performed early.

It often involves young patients sustaining multiple injuries, with a high associated mortality rate. Management should begin at the scene of injury and relies on a structured chain of care in order to transport the trauma patient to the appropriate hospital center. Management is multi-disciplinary, involving intensive care specialists, surgeons and radiologists. Imaging to precisely define injury is best performed with whole body dual phase computed tomography, which can also identify the source of bleeding. Non-operative management has developed considerably over the years: this includes selective embolization in case of active bleeding or vascular anomalies in stable or stabilized patients after resuscitation. Embolization has become one of the corner stones of abdominal trauma management and interventional radiologists must play an active role on the trauma team. This overview details the different embolization procedures according to the involved organ and embolic agent used.

This study did not include patients who sustained blunt trauma or non-traumatic wounds, as well as patients with penetrating head and neck injury, limb injury, ano-perineal injury, or isolated thoracic injury above the fifth costal interspace. In addition, we also included cases that were reviewed in emergency department morbidity and mortality conferences during the same period. Mortality was 5.9% (11\/186 patients). Mean age was 36 years (range: 13-87). Seventy-eight percent (145 patients) suffered stab wounds. Most patients were hemodynamically stable or stabilized upon arrival at the hospital (163 patients: 87.6%). Six resuscitative thoracotomies were performed, five for gunshot wounds, one for a stab wound. When abdominal exploration was necessary, laparotomy was chosen most often (78\/186: 41.9%), while laparoscopy was performed in 46 cases (24.7%), with conversion to laparotomy in nine cases. Abdominal penetration was found in 103 cases (55.4%) and thoracic penetration in 44 patients (23.7%). Twenty-nine patients (15.6%) had both thoracic and abdominal penetration (with 16 diaphragmatic wounds). Suicide attempts were recorded in 43 patients (23.1%), 31 (72.1%) with peritoneal penetration. Two patients (1.1%) required operation for delayed peritonitis, one who had had a laparotomy qualified as \"negative\", and another who had undergone surgical exploration of his wound under general anesthesia.

The purpose of this retrospective study of prospectively collected data was to analyze why these patients do not have AS and evaluate their immediate post-operative course, in order to broaden the indications for AS. Between January and December 2013, the reasons why patients who had appropriate indications for ambulatory cholecystectomy or hernia repair but later had conventional hospital management were recorded. The primary endpoint was early post-operative morbidity. Secondary endpoints were demographic, surgical, anesthetic, post-operative data as well as analysis of criteria leading to conventional hospital stay. Among 410 patients undergoing surgery for accepted AS indications, 158 (39%) did not have AS; 113 out of these patients (72%) were discharged the day following surgery. Of the 69 patients (43.6%) who did not have AS for medical reasons (50 by the surgeon's decision alone), 60 patients could have undergone AS since their outcome was uneventful in 96% of cases; only three patients (2.5%) had post-operative complications. The AS rate could have been increased by 15% through better surgical and anesthetic collaboration. ","634":"","635":"Splenectomy is attended by medical complications, principally infectious and thromboembolic; the frequency of complications varies with the conditions that led to splenectomy (hematologic splenectomy, trauma, presence of portal hypertension). Most infectious complications are caused by encapsulated bacteria (Meningococcus, Pneumococcus, Hemophilus). These occur mainly in children and somewhat less commonly in adults within the first two years following splenectomy. Post-splenectomy infections are potentially severe with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) and this justifies preventive measures (prophylactic antibiotics, appropriate immunizations, patient education) and demands prompt antibiotic management with third-generation cephalosporins for any post-splenectomy fever. Thromboembolic complications can involve both the caval system (deep-vein thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) and the portal system. Portal vein thrombosis occurs more commonly in patients with myeloproliferative disease and cirrhosis. No thromboembolic prophylaxis is recommended apart from perioperative low molecular weight heparin. However, some authors choose to prescribe a short course of anti-platelet medication if the post-splenectomy patient develops significant thrombocytosis. Thrombosis of the portal or caval venous system requires prolonged warfarin anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months. Finally, some studies have suggested an increase in the long-term incidence of cancer in splenectomized patients.

All caregivers should thoroughly understand the pre-established protocols of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to allow optimal management of unstable trauma victims in whom hemostasis must be obtained as soon as possible to decrease the morbid consequences of post-hemorrhagic shock. In patients with acute respiratory, circulatory or neurologic distress, several surgical procedures must be performed without delay by whichever surgeon is on call. Our goal is to describe these salvage procedures including invasive approaches to the upper respiratory tract, decompressive thoracostomy, hemostatic or resuscitative thoracotomy, hemostatic laparotomy, preperitoneal pelvic packing, external pelvic fixation by a pelvi-clamp, decompressive craniotomy.

Between 01\/2010 and 12\/2013, a total of 248 consecutive patients who underwent PD with a modified PJ were identified from our database and retrospectively analyzed. POPF cases were divided into three categories (ISGPF-international study group-guidelines): biochemical fistula without clinical sequelae (grade A), fistula requiring any therapeutic intervention (grade B), and fistula with severe clinical sequelae (grade C). Perioperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. The overwhelming majority of patients had no evidence of fistula. Grade A POPF was observed in 9 (3.62%), grade B in 1 (0.40%), and grade C in 0 patients. There were no postoperative deaths. Overall complications occurred in 61 patients (24.59%) of patients after PD. This modified pancreaticojejunostomy is widely applicable and is associated with very low rates of POPF, low postoperative morbidity and mortality. Overall, it is a feasible and safe novel approach with excellent short-term outcomes. ","641":"Penetrating pelvic trauma (PPT) is defined as a wound extending within the bony confines of the pelvis to involve the vascular, intestinal or urinary pelvic organs. The gravity of PPT is related to initial hemorrhage and the high risk of late infection. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable and in hemorrhagic shock, the urgent treatment goal is rapid achievement of hemostasis. Initial strategy relies on insertion of an intra-aortic occlusion balloon and\/or extraperitoneal pelvic packing, performed while damage control resuscitation is ongoing before proceeding to arteriography. If hemodynamic instability persists, a laparotomy for hemostasis is performed without delay. In a hemodynamically stable patient, contrast-enhanced CT is systematically performed to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the lesions prior to surgery. At surgery, damage control principles should be applied to all involved systems (digestive, vascular, urinary and bone), with exteriorization of digestive and urinary channels, arterial revascularization, and wide drainage of peri-rectal and pelvic soft tissues. When immediate definitive surgery is performed, management must address the frequent associated lesions in order to reduce the risk of postoperative sepsis and fistula.

The injuries are polymorphic including hematoma, seromuscular tear, perforation, and ischemia. They preferentially involve the small bowel and may result in bleeding and\/or peritonitis. An urgent laparotomy is necessary if there is evidence of active bleeding or peritonitis at the initial examination, but these situations are uncommon. The main diagnostic challenge is to promptly and correctly identify lesions that require surgical repair. Diagnostic delay exceeding eight hours before surgical repair is associated with increased morbidity and probably with mortality. Because of this risk, the traditional therapeutic approach has been to operate on all patients with suspected bowel or mesenteric injury. However, this approach leads to a high rate of non-therapeutic laparotomy. A new approach of non-operative management (NOM) may be applicable to hemodynamically stable patients with no signs of perforation or peritonitis, and is being increasingly employed. This attitude has been described in several recent studies, and can be applied to nearly 40% of patients. However, there is no consensual agreement on which criteria or combination of clinical and radiological signs can insure the safety of NOM. When NOM is decided upon at the outset, very close monitoring is mandatory with repeated clinical examinations and interval computerized tomography (CT).

Moreover, pancreatico-enteric anastomotic breakdown remains a life-threatening complication. For these reasons, the management of the pancreatic stump following resection is still one of the most hotly debated issues in digestive surgery; more than 80 different methods of pancreatico-enteric reconstructions having been described, and no gold standard has yet been defined.

Retrospective study of PT treated in the University Hospital of Grenoble over a 22-year span. The decision for initial laparotomy depended on hemodynamic status as well as on associated lesions. Main pancreatic duct lesions were always searched for. PT lesions were graded according to the AAST classification. Of a total of 46 PT, 34 were grades II or I. Hemodynamic instability led to immediate laparotomy in 18 patients, for whom treatment was always drainage of the pancreatic bed; morbidity was 30%. Eight patients had grade III injuries, six of whom underwent immediate operation: three underwent splenopancreatectomy without any major complications while the other three who had simple drainage required re-operation for peritonitis, with one death related to pancreatic complications. Four patients had grades IV or V PT: two pancreatoduodenectomies were performed, with no major complication, while one patient underwent duodenal reconstruction with pancreatic drainage, complicated by pancreatic and duodenal fistula requiring a hospital stay of two months. The post-trauma course was complicated for all patients with main pancreatic duct involvement. Our outcomes were similar to those found in the literature. In patients with distal PT and main pancreatic duct involvement, simple drainage is associated with high morbidity and mortality. For proximal PT, the therapeutic options of drainage versus pancreatoduodenectomy must be weighed; pancreatoduodenectomy may be unavoidable when the duodenum is injured as well.

After debridement of necrotic tissue, reconstructive surgery was necessary. We opted for an anterolateral thigh flap based on a proximal vascular pedicle. In this case, there was a major loss of substance that included the rectus abdominis fascia below the level of the arcuate line. This situation required a fascial reconstruction of the abdominal wall; a defect of this size would typically require synthetic mesh for closure. The anterolateral thigh flap allowed us to avoid the use of foreign material by repairing the defect with a pedicle flap including fascia lata and the quadriceps aponeurosis.

Plain radiographs have little or no place in the evaluation of the acute abdomen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) still has limited availability in many hospitals, thus narrowing the imaging choice to ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT). No scientific evidence exists to allow the imposition of one single strategy. At the present time, the clinician may choose either routine US evaluation complemented by CT in case the US is inconclusive or first-line CT (except for the evaluation of right lower quadrant [RLQ] pain, right upper quadrant [RUQ] pain and in pregnant women where ultrasound is the first-line study).

So protection of the GDA stump may avoid this devastating complication. This is a retrospective observational study. All patients, who underwent a PD between August 2007 and December 2014, were included in the study. We used pedicled falciform ligament flap to protect the GDA stump. After PD, pedicled falciform ligament flap was spread widely over the skeletonized hepatic artery including the GDA stump and was fixed to the surrounding retroperitoneal connective tissue. This procedure allowed complete separation of the GDA stump from the pancreatic stump. We performed 182 cases of PD during the study period. Although, 27 (15%) patients developed pancreatic fistula and six patients developed intra-abdominal abscess, no one experienced hemorrhage due to erosion or pseudoaneurysm formation of the GDA.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a transgluteal approach by reviewing our clinical experience. We reviewed medical records of patients having undergone percutaneous CT-guided transgluteal drainage for deep pelvic abscesses. We focused on the duration of catheter drainage, the complications related to the procedures and the rate of complete resolution. Between 2005 and 2013, 39patients (27women and 12men; mean age: 52.5) underwent transgluteal approach CT-guided percutaneous drainage of pelvis abscesses in our department. The origins of abscesses were postoperative complications in 34patients (87.2%) and infectious intra-abdominal disease in 5patients (12.8%). The mean duration of drainage was 8.3days (range: 3-33). Laboratory cultures were positive in 35patients (89.7%) and Escherichia coli was present in 71.4% of the positive samples. No major complication was observed. Drainage was successful in 38patients (97.4%). A transpiriformis approach was more significantly associated with intra-procedural pain (P=0.003).

Early use of pertinent imaging may reduce this delay. Surgical procedures in the elderly do not differ from those in younger patients, but their associated morbidity is different. Assessing co-morbidities and patient frailty, as well as taking into consideration the diagnosis, patients' wishes and status should help in decision-making.

","698":"The performance of emergency abdominal surgery in an outpatient setting is increasingly the order of the day in France. This review evaluates the feasibility and reliability of ambulatory surgical treatment of the most common abdominal emergencies: appendectomy for acute appendicitis and cholecystectomy for acute complications of gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis). This study evaluates surgical procedures performed on an ambulatory basis according to the international definition (admission in the morning, discharge in the evening with a hospital stay of less than 12 hours). Just as for elective surgery, eligibility of patients for an ambulatory approach depends on the capacities of the surgical and anesthesia team: to manage the risks, particularly the risk of deferring surgery until the morning); to prevent or treat post-operative symptoms like pain, nausea, vomiting, re-ambulation in order to permit rapid post-operative discharge. Recent studies have shown that appendectomy for non-complicated acute appendicitis can be deferred for up to 12 hours without any increase in danger. Many other studies have shown that early discharge after appendectomy for acute non-complicated appendicitis is feasible and safe. Nonetheless, there is only one published series of truly ambulatory appendectomies. The results were excellent. Patients who presented in the afternoon were brought back for operation the following morning. The appropriate timing for performance of cholecystectomy in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis has not been well defined, but is always somewhat delayed relative to the onset of symptoms. To minimize operative complications, cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis should probably be performed between 24 and 72 hours after diagnosis. Cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis should probably not be delayed longer than a week; the need to keep the patient hospitalized during the interval has not been demonstrated. Early discharge after cholecystectomy was usually possible, even in series where acute cholecystitis was diagnosed intra-operatively. Cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis seems to be feasible but no reports specifically support this approach.

Our objective was to compare the clinicopathological features and outcomes in patients undergoing curative resection between SRCs and non-SRCs histologic types of early gastric cancer. Clinicopathologic features and the overall survival rates of 334 patients with early gastric cancer undergoing D2 curative resection from January 1994 to December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed and compared according to the histologic type. Clinicopathologic features were comparable between two groups, except age, ulcer findings and the presence of lymph node metastasis. The incidence of recurrence for SRCs group was significantly lower than that for non-SRCs group (10.4% vs. 19.6%; P&lt;0.05). The overall 5-year survival rate was 88.6% in all cases. The overall survival rate of patients in SRCs group was significantly better than that of patients in non-SRCs group (5-year survival, 93.9% vs. 85.8%; P=0.027). Multivariable analysis revealed that SRCs subtype, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors. Our analysis revealed that the biological behavior of SRCs was different from other undifferentiated cancer histologic subtypes in early stage. Early gastric cancer with signet ring cell histology had low incidence of lymph node metastasis and a relatively favorable prognosis. ","704":"","705":"Prophylactic drainage of the abdominal cavity after gastro-intestinal surgery is widely used. The rationale is that intra-abdominal drainage enhances early detection of complications (gastro-intestinal leakage, hemorrhage, bile leak), prevents collection of fluid or pus, reduces morbidity and mortality, and decreases the duration of hospital stay. However, dogmatic attitudes favoring systematic drain placement should be questioned. The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence supporting systematic use of prophylactic abdominal drainage following gastrectomy, pancreatectomy, liver resection, and rectal resection. Based on this review of the literature: (i) there was no evidence in favor of intra-peritoneal drainage following total or sub-total gastrectomy with respect to morbidity-mortality, nor was it helpful in the diagnosis or management of leakage, however the level of evidence is low, (ii) following pancreatic resection, data are conflicting but, overall, suggest that the absence of drainage is prejudicial, and support the notion that short-term drainage is better than long-term drainage, (iii) after liver resection without hepatico-intestinal anastomosis, high level evidence supports that there is no need for abdominal drainage, and (iv) following rectal resection, data are insufficient to establish recommendations. However, results from the French multicenter randomized controlled trial GRECCAR5 (NCT01269567) should provide new evidence this coming year. Accumulating data support that systematic drainage of the abdominal cavity in digestive surgery is a non-beneficial and obsolete practice, except following pancreatectomy where the consensus appears to indicate the usefulness of short-term drainage. While the level of evidence is high for liver resections, new randomized controlled trials are awaited regarding gastric, pancreatic and rectal surgery.

Four hundred and forty-eight consecutive patients were treated between 1990 and 2014 for pancreatic injuries of whom 49 (median age: 30, range: 13-68 years, 41 men, blunt injuries: n=43) had an IPI. Thirty-four (70%) patients underwent urgent surgery, 20 of whom had a distal pancreatectomy and 14 had external drainage of the pancreatic injury. Fifteen (30%) patients presented with a non-resolving pancreatic pseudocyst or fistula; five had grade 4A or 4B ductal injuries and underwent surgery, 10 with 3A and 3B ductal injuries were successfully managed endoscopically. Fifty-five percent had postoperative morbidity. Two patients (4%) died of non-pancreatic-related causes. While overall mortality is low after an IPI, morbidity is high. Two thirds of patients required operative intervention and one third were treated endoscopically. The degree of pancreatic ductal injury determined whether endoscopic intervention was effective.

Almost all liver surgery is performed in patients with cancer, a factor that increases the risk of malnutrition. The primary risk factors for post-operative complications are pre-operative hypo-albuminemia and a body mass index less than 20 kg\/m(2). To improve the prediction of complications in these patients, some teams have suggested measurement of muscle thickness by computed tomography. Muscular mass can thus be quantified by measuring the total surface of the psoas muscle or the total surface of all muscles (i.e. external and internal oblique, transverse, psoas and paravertebral muscles) seen on an axial CT slice at L3. As well, data exist suggesting that sarcopenia is an independent predictive factor of post-operative morbidity and poor long-term survival after resection for cancer. Nonetheless, the literature on the subject is limited, there are no standardized definitions for sarcopenia, and the need of special software to calculate the surfaces limits its usefulness. Lastly, there are little if any data concerning the nutritional or pharmacologic means to treat sarcopenia. This update, based on a literature review, deals with the value and the prognostic impact of sarcopenia in surgery for liver tumors.

The need for urgent control of hemorrhage and limb ischemia may contra-indicate immediate transfer to a hospital with a specialized vascular surgery service. For a non-specialized surgeon, hemostasis and revascularization rely largely on damage control techniques and the use of temporary vascular shunts (TVS). Insertion of a TVS is indicated for vascular injuries involving the proximal portion of extremity vessels, while hemorrhage from distal arterial injuries can be treated with simple arterial ligature. Proximal and distal control of the injured vessel must be obtained, followed by proximal and distal Fogarty catheter thrombectomy and lavage with heparinized saline. The diameter of the TVS should be closely approximated to that of the artery; use of an oversized TVS may result in intimal tears. Systematic performance of decompressive fasciotomy is recommended in order to prevent compartment syndrome. In the immediate postoperative period, the need for systematic use of anticoagulant or anti-aggregant medications has not been demonstrated. The patient should be transferred to a specialized center for vascular surgery as soon as possible. The interval before definitive revascularization depends on the overall condition of the patient. The long-term limb conservation results after placement of a TVS are identical to those obtained when initial revascularization is performed.

Between 1999 and 2014, 172 patients underwent LHS at our institution, including 151 liver resections and 21 fenestrations of hepatic cysts. The consecutive series of highly selected patients who underwent ambulatory LHS were included in this study. Twenty patients underwent ambulatory LHS. Indications were liver cysts in 10 cases, liver angioma in 3 cases, focal nodular hyperplasia in 3 cases, and colorectal hepatic metastasis in 4 cases. The median operative time was 92 minutes (range: 50-240 minutes). The median blood loss was 35 mL (range: 20-150 mL). There were no postoperative complications or re-hospitalizations. All patients were hospitalized after surgery in our ambulatory surgery unit, and were discharged 5-7 hours after surgery. The median postoperative pain score at the time of discharge was 3 (visual analogue scale: 0-10; range: 0-4). The median quality-of-life score at the first postoperative visit was 8 (range: 6-10) and the median cosmetic satisfaction score was 8 (range: 7-10).

Pre- and postoperative enteral feeding is preferred. In patients without obvious undernutrition, postoperative nutritional support has to be initiated if patients cannot maintain oral intake above 60% of recommended intake for more than 7 days, and it has to be programmed if it is anticipated that the patient will be unable to eat for more than 7 days.

Although malnutrition reflects the severity of cancer, it is important to underline that anticancer treatments including surgery likely increase the severity of malnutrition. Additionally, malnutrition is associated with an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Nutritional assessment should be a part of pre-treatment work up of gastrointestinal cancer patients because nutritional support has been shown to limit the negative impact of malnutrition on perioperative outcome. The objective of these practice guidelines is to address the following questions regarding nutritional screening in gastrointestinal cancer patients: who should benefit from nutritional assessment, when nutritional assessment should be proposed, how nutritional assessment should be carried out and why nutritional assessment is indicated.

Three hundred eighty-five patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for neoplasms from 1998 to 2011 were included in the study, and were divided in two groups: group 1, patients younger than 80 years of age, and group 2, patients 80 years of age and older. Operative morbidity, mortality, disease-free and long-term survival were analysed. English literature was systematically searched for pancreatic resection's outcome in octogenarians. There were 385 pancreaticoduodenectomies: 362 patients were in group 1 and 23 patients in group 2. There was no significant difference regarding gender, and pathologic findings between the two groups. Complications' rate (40 vs. 43%), mortality rate (4% vs. 0%), and overall median survival for pancreatic cancer patients were not statistically different in the two groups (median 21 vs. 19 months). Literature's review showed 14 reports of pancreatic resection in octogenarians. Most of the studies (particularly in centres with high-volume pancreatic surgery) showed that outcome after pancreatectomy was not different in octogenarians or in younger patients.

This is a monocenter retrospective observational study including patients with a preoperative diagnosis of sigmoid stricture associated with diverticular disease undergoing operation between Jan 1, 2007 and Dec 31, 2013.

If there are no criteria of gravity, initial treatment should be conservative or pharmacologic using neostigmine; decompression of colonic gas is also a favored treatment in the decision tree, especially when cecal dilatation reaches dimensions that are considered at high risk for perforation. Recurrence is prevented by the use of a multiperforated Faucher rectal tube and oral or colonic administration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) laxative. Alternative therapeutic methods include: epidural anesthesia, needle decompression guided either radiologically or colonoscopically, or percutaneous cecostomy.

Infection is usually bacterial, sometimes parasitic, or very rarely fungal. In the Western world, bacterial (pyogenic) HA is most prevalent; the mortality is high approaching 15%, due mostly to patient debilitation and persistence of the underlying cause. In South-East Asia and Africa, amebic infection is the most frequent cause. The etiologies of HA are multiple including lithiasic biliary disease (cholecystitis, cholangitis), intra-abdominal collections (appendicitis, sigmoid diverticulitis, Crohn's disease), and bile duct ischemia secondary to pancreatoduodenectomy, liver transplantation, interventional techniques (radio-frequency ablation, intra-arterial chemo-embolization), and\/or liver trauma. More rarely, HA occurs in the wake of septicemia either on healthy or preexisting liver diseases (biliary cysts, hydatid cyst, cystic or necrotic metastases). The incidence of HA secondary to Klebsiella pneumoniae is increasing and can give rise to other distant septic metastases. The diagnosis of HA depends mainly on imaging (sonography and\/or CT scan), with confirmation by needle aspiration for bacteriology studies. The therapeutic strategy consists of bactericidal antibiotics, adapted to the germs, sometimes in combination with percutaneous or surgical drainage, and control of the primary source. The presence of bile in the aspirate or drainage fluid attests to communication with the biliary tree and calls for biliary MRI looking for obstruction. When faced with HA, the attending physician should seek advice from a multi-specialty team including an interventional radiologist, a hepatobiliary surgeon and an infectious disease specialist. This should help to determine the origin and mechanisms responsible for the abscess, and to then propose the best appropriate treatment. The presence of chronic enteric biliary contamination (i.e., sphincterotomy, bilio-enterostomy) should be determined before performing radio-frequency ablation and\/or chemo-embolization; substantial stenosis of the celiac trunk should be detected before performing pancreatoduodenectomy to help avoid iatrogenic HA.

From June 2012 to June 2013, 100 consecutive patients were included in a prospective study according to the post-operative care protocol developed by den Dulk et al. The score is based on several laboratory and clinical items recorded daily. Among the 100 patients, 12 developed a post-operative AL (12%) with a specific mortality rate of 16.6% (2 patients). A DULK-score&gt;3 was good criteria for early diagnosis of AL with a sensitivity of 91.7%, a specificity of 55.7%, a positive predictive value of 22%, a negative predictive value of 98%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83. If used routinely, the DULK-score would allow diagnosis of AL 3.5 days earlier than clinical judgment alone. The DULK-score was superior to common diagnostic criteria described in the literature such as the C-reactive protein or procalcitonin, in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. The DULK-score is, at present, the most reliable instrument for early diagnosis of AL after colorectal surgery and should be integrated into risk management health policies aiming to improve the quality of care according to the \"failure to rescue\" concept.

However, interventions that minimize pain and reduce opioid consumption have certain advantages for patients by avoiding side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been used to minimize pain in a diverse range of surgical procedures but its safety on patients undergoing TEP repair has yet to be investigated. To assess the results of outpatient TEP repair with TAP block without curare. Consecutive patients undergoing elective TEP procedure were prospectively enrolled. Patients in two institutes received a similar anesthetic, surgical, and analgesic treatment protocol. Fifty consecutive day-case patients were included in this series. The TEP repair was successful in 49 patients and there was one conversion to transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) endoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Identification of risk factors is essential for the prevention of AL. AL can present with various clinical pictures, ranging from the absence of symptoms to life-threatening septic shock. Contrast-enhanced CT scan is the most complete investigation to define AL and its consequences. Early and optimal multidisciplinary management is based on three options: medical management, radiologic or endoscopic intervention, or surgical re-intervention. Prompt treatment should help decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality, with the choice depending on the septic status of the patient. If the patient is asymptomatic, treatment can be medical only, coupled with close surveillance. Interventional management is indicated when the fistula is symptomatic but not life-threatening. On the other hand, when the vital prognosis is engaged, surgery is indicated, emergently, associated with intensive care. Even more than their prevention, early and appropriate management counts most to decrease their consequences.

The question of whether or not to preserve the anal sphincter lies at the center of the therapeutic choice. Histologically, tumor-free distal and circumferential margins of&gt;1mm allow a favorable oncologic outcome. Whether such margins can be obtained depends of TNM staging, tumor location, response to chemoradiotherapy and type of surgical procedure. The technique of intersphincteric resection relies on these narrow margins to spare the sphincter. This procedure provides satisfactory oncologic outcome with a rate of circumferential margin involvement ranging from 5% to 11%, while good continence is maintained in half of the patients. The extralevator abdominoperineal resection provides good oncologic results, however this procedure requires a permanent colostomy.

Its pathogenesis is due to multiple factors: mechanical trauma, sphincter spasm, and ischemia. Treatment must address these causative factors. While American and British scientific societies have published recommendations, there is no formal treatment consensus in France. Medical treatment is non-specific, aimed at softening the stool and facilitating regular bowel movements; this results in healing of almost 50% of acute anal fissures. The risk of recurrent fissure remains high if the causative factors persist. If non-specific medical treatment fails, specific medical treatment can be offered to reversibly decrease hypertonic sphincter spasm. Surgery remains the most effective long-term treatment and should be offered for cases of chronic or complicated anal fissure but also for acute anal fissure with severe pain or for recurrent fissure despite optimal medical treatment. Surgical treatment is based on two principles that may be combined: decreasing sphincter tone and excision of the anal fissure. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is the best-evaluated technique and remains the gold standard in English-speaking countries. Since LIS is associated with some risk of irreversible anal incontinence, its use is controversial in France where fissurectomy combined with anoplasty is preferred.

However, the success rate of SSTs is lower than that of fistulotomy. Ligation of the Intersphincteric Fistula Tract (LIFT) is one of the most recent SSTs. It aims to ligate and transect the fistula by an approach through the intersphincteric space.

Risk of morbidity (Dindo-Clavien criteria) and mortality (criteria of the AFC-French Association of Surgery) were evaluated. Thirteen patients in the open surgical group were operated in a 10-year period and 17 patients in the laparoscopy group were operated on in a seven-year period. The mean age (57 years in both groups) and sex ratio (0.7 versus 0.6, respectively), and the length of hospital stay (18 versus 15 days, respectively) were comparable in the two groups.

This technique is simple and rapid, and avoids ileostomy and\/or ileo-cecal resection. The goal of this case-series was to describe the technique of ileo-right colic intussuscepted anastomosis as an alternative to ileostomy. This is a retrospective, monocenter study of patients with lesions of the terminal ileum who were managed with right ileo-colic intussuscepted anastomosis between January 2008 and December 2013. The technique was standardized. The main outcome criterion was the post-operative complication rate. Four patients, three female and one male, with a median age of 35 years were managed with ileo-right colic intussuscepted anastomosis for necrosis of the terminal ileum. The cause of distal ileal necrosis was necrosis secondary to tubo-ovarian abscess and perforation secondary to non-specific ileitis, in one patient each, and band-related bowel obstruction with extended necrosis in two patients. There was no reported post-operative morbidity or mortality and, in particular, no post-operative anastomotic leak occurred. Based on the findings in the literature and our series, right ileo-colic intussuscepted anastomosis is a simple technique, easy to learn and associated with little morbidity.

Later, fibrosis or even secondary biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension can develop, enhanced by prolonged biliary obstruction associated with recurrent cholangitis.

Parameters that determine the management of late complications of BDI include the type of biliary injury, associated vascular injury, hepatic atrophy, the presence of intra-hepatic strictures or lithiasis, repetitive infectious complications, the quality of underlying parenchyma (fibrosis, secondary biliary cirrhosis) and the presence of portal hypertension. Endoscopic drainage is indicated for patients with uncontrolled acute sepsis, patients at high operative risk, patients with cirrhosis who are not eligible for liver transplantation and patients who have previously undergone several attempts at repair. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, whether de novo or as an iterative repair, is the technique of reference for post-cholecystectomy BDI. Hepatic resection is indicated in only rare instances, mainly in case of extended hilar stricture, multiple stone retention in one sector of the liver or in patients for whom the repair is deemed technically difficult.

","816":"Liver tumors bleed rarely; management has changed radically during the last 20years, advancing from emergency surgery with poor results to multidisciplinary management. The first steps are the diagnosis and control of bleeding. Abdominopelvic CT scan should be performed as soon as patient hemodynamics allow. When active bleeding is visualized, arterial embolization, targeted as selectively as possible, is preferable to surgery, which should be reserved for severe hemodynamic instability or failure of interventional radiology. When surgery is unavoidable, abbreviated laparotomy (damage control) with perihepatic packing is recommended. The second step is determination of the etiology and treatment of the underlying tumor. Adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the two most frequently encountered tumors in this context. Liver MRI after control of the bleeding episode generally leads to the diagnosis although sometimes the analysis can be difficult because of the hematoma. Prompt resection is indicated for HCC, atypical adenoma or lesions at risk for degeneration to hepatocellular carcinoma. For adenoma with no suspicion of malignancy, it is best to wait for the hematoma to resorb completely before undertaking appropriate therapy.

Because of the particularly grim prognosis of gallbladder cancer, especially when discovered at a late stage, it is especially important to focus on the potential for malignant degeneration of any gallbladder lesion. Imaging plays an important role in distinguishing these lesions; ultrasound remains the key diagnostic tool for gallbladder disease, but other modalities including CT and MRI may help to characterize these lesions. The resulting treatment strategies vary widely depending on the risk of malignancy.

Once the patient has been stabilized, the main objective and greatest difficulty is to identify the location of bleeding in order to provide specific appropriate treatment. While upper endoscopy and colonoscopy remain the essential first-line examinations, the development and availability of angiography have made this an important imaging modality for cases of active bleeding; they allow diagnostic localization of bleeding and guide subsequent therapy, whether therapeutic embolization, interventional colonoscopy or, if other techniques fail or are unavailable, surgery directed at the precise site of bleeding. Furthermore, newly developed endoscopic techniques, particularly video capsule enteroscopy, now allow minimally invasive exploration of the small intestine; if this is positive, it will guide subsequent assisted enteroscopy or surgery. Other small bowel imaging techniques include enteroclysis by CT or magnetic resonance imaging. At the present time, exploratory surgery is no longer a first-line approach. In view of the lesser gravity of LGI bleeding, it is most reasonable to simply stabilize the patient initially for subsequent transfer to a specialized center, if minimally invasive techniques are not available at the local hospital.

Several anticancer agents can be administered to hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (HMCRC) by HACT. Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), used mainly in the United States, has a high intrahepatic extraction rate but also has intrinsic hepatobiliary toxicity. The HACT route is less suitable for irinotecan, since its active metabolite requires first-pass metabolism. In France, oxaliplatin is the most commonly used agent administered by HACT in combination with intravenous chemotherapy according to a 5-FU-Leucovorin protocol. The three main indications for HACT are: (1) potentially resectable HMCRC, (2) adjuvant treatment after resection of HMCRC in patients at high risk of intrahepatic recurrence, (3) palliative treatment of patients with primarily intra-hepatic disease that is definitely unresectable. In the setting of potentially resectable HMCRC, HACT can increase the chemotherapeutic response rate and improve the rate of secondary resectability. In the adjuvant setting, HACT seems to improve disease-free survival after complete resection of HMCRC in patients at high risk of intrahepatic recurrence.

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU\/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days).

The principle of this imaging technique relies on the intravenous administration of indocyanine green before surgery and the illumination of the surface of the liver by an infrared camera that simultaneously induces and collects the fluorescence. Detection by fluorescence is based on the contrast between the (fluorescent) tumoral or peri-tumoral tissues and the healthy (non-fluorescent) liver. Results suggest that indocyanine green fluorescence imaging is capable of identification of new liver cancers and enables the characterization of known hepatic lesions in real time during liver resection. The purpose of this paper is to present the fundamental principles of fluorescence imaging detection, to describe successively the practical and technical aspects of its use and the appearance of hepatic lesions in fluorescence, and to expose the diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives of this innovative imaging technique in liver surgery. ","861":"Surgical treatment of anal incontinence is indicated only for patients who have failed medical treatment. Sphincterorraphy is suitable in case of external sphincter rupture. In the last decade, sacral nerve stimulation has proven to be a scientifically validated solution when no sphincter lesion has been identified and more recently has also been proposed as an alternative in cases of limited sphincter defect. Anal reconstruction using artificial sphincters is still under evaluation in the literature, while indications for dynamic graciloplasty are decreasing due to its complexity and high morbidity. Less risky techniques involving intra-sphincteric injections are being developed, with encouraging preliminary results that need to be confirmed especially in the medium- and long-term. Antegrade colonic enemas instilled via cecostomy (Malone) can be an alternative to permanent stoma in patients who are well instructed in the techniques of colonic lavage. Stomal diversion is a solution of last resort. ","862":"Endpoints are measurable clinical and biological findings that are used for the development and assessment of treatment options. In the treatment of cancer, endpoints can be classified into two categories: \"patient-centered clinical endpoints\" including overall survival (OS) and health-related quality of life (QoL), and \"tumor-centered clinical endpoints\" such as progression-free survival. Surrogate endpoints are tumor-centered clinical endpoints that can be used as substitutes for patient-centered clinical endpoints, particularly OS. The choice of endpoints in oncology trials is a major problem. The published Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) best-practice guidelines encourage the reporting of clearly defined primary and secondary outcome measures. OS is the gold standard of endpoints but as increasing numbers of effective salvage treatments become available for many types of cancer, much larger numbers of patients are included; this requires a longer follow-up period and increases the cost of clinical trials. Thus, tumor-centered clinical endpoints that can be assessed earlier and used as surrogates for overall survival are increasingly studied, but most of them currently lack standardized definitions to enable cross comparison of results among different clinical trials and they have not been validated as surrogate endpoints. In addition, the variability of their definition can strongly impact the trial's conclusions by affecting both statistical power and estimation. In this context, QoL constitutes an available and useful surrogate endpoint for trials to ensure treatment benefit from both the patient and public health points of view. Methodological research should be pursued to develop standard outcome definitions for use in cancer clinical trials and to define a standardized longitudinal analysis of QoL data.

","866":"Despite the prevalence of complex ventral hernias, there is little agreement on the most appropriate technique or prosthetic to repair these defects, especially in contaminated fields. Our objective was to determine French surgical practice patterns among academic surgeons in complex ventral hernia repair (CVHR) with regard to indications, most appropriate techniques, choice of prosthesis, and experience with complications. A survey consisting of 21 questions and 6 case-scenarios was e-mailed to French practicing academic surgeons performing CVHR, representing all French University Hospitals. Forty over 54 surgeons (74%) responded to the survey, representing 29 French University Hospitals. Regarding the techniques used for CVHR, primary closure without reinforcement was provided in 31.6% of cases, primary closure using the component separation technique without mesh use in 43.7% of cases, mesh positioned as a bridge in 16.5% of cases, size reduction of the defect by using aponeurotomy incisions without mesh use in 8.2% of cases. Among the 40 respondents, 36 had experience with biologic mesh. There was a strong consensus among surveyed surgeons for not using synthetic mesh in contaminated or dirty fields (100%), but for using it in clean settings (100%). There was also a strong consensus between respondents for using biologic mesh in contaminated (82.5%) or infected (77.5%) fields and for not using it in clean setting (95%). In clean-contaminated surgery, there was no consensus for defining the optimal therapeutic strategy in CVHR. Infection was the most common complication reported after biologic mesh used (58%). The most commonly reported influences for the use of biologic grafts included literature, conferences and discussion with colleagues (85.0%), personal experience (45.0%) and cost (40.0%). Despite a lack of level I evidence, biologic meshes are being used by 90% of surveyed surgeons for CVHR. Importantly, there was a strong consensus for using them in contaminated or infected fields and for not using them in clean setting. To better guide surgeons, prospective, randomized trials should be undertaken to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes associated with these materials in various surgical wound classifications.

An anonymous questionnaire was sent by E-mail in 2011 to all residents and chief-residents in visceral and digestive surgery in France. The questionnaire addressed demographic characteristics, educational resources used and desired, as well as the current medical and university curriculum. The practical and theoretical aspects of training were evaluated. Of 208 residents, 63% responded to the survey (96 residents and 35 chief-residents). Daily practice of surgery and the reading of English-language articles were the two most frequently used teaching resources. Surgical training was judged satisfactory by 41.2% of respondents. In multivariate analysis, only the function of chief-resident (p &lt; 0.001) and authorship as first author of scientific papers (p = 0.041) were associated with a feeling of satisfaction. Surgical training on animals, use of online course materials, and the establishment of a mentoring process during residency were rated favorable by more than 80%. The majority of residents and chief-residents in visceral and digestive surgery in France believe their training is unsatisfactory. However, this dissatisfaction decreases progressively throughout the training period. Strengthening of companionship through tutoring, better information on existing resources, and improved access to surgical training in animals should enhance satisfaction.

However, laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is associated with significant advantages: faster recovery, less post-operative pain, less morbidity, easier subsequent surgery and better cosmetic results. Since the inception of this technique, more than 3000 procedures have been reported. The aim of this update was to review the literature in order to define the indications (malignant tumors, benign tumors, major resections), the advantages and limits of this approach as well as the expected value of new technology, such as intra-operative guidance or robotics, in the development of this branch of surgery.

Nevertheless, in France, concerns have been raised that limited skin excision during mastectomy could result in an increased risk of local recurrence especially in invasive breast cancer; many surgeons continue to have reservations regarding the oncologic safety of this operation. This is a retrospective, long-term follow-up study of 400 patients operated and followed by two oncoplastic surgeons. A total of 400 patients with breast cancer underwent SSM with immediate breast reconstruction from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2002. The American Joint Committee on Cancer pathological staging was Stage 0 (41.5%), Stage I (33.25%), Stage II (16%), Stage III (7.5%), while 1.75% were non-stageable. With a mean follow-up period of 88 months (range: 13-215 months), the locoregional recurrence rate was 3.5%, the rate of distant metastases was 13.5%, and 83% of patients have remained free of recurrent disease. This study provides encouraging results suggesting that skin-sparing mastectomy is a safe and reliable option for the management of selected cases of women with invasive or in situ breast cancer. ","881":"Rectovaginal fistulas constitute a serious burden for the affected patient and a major challenge for the attending surgeon. Definitive surgical treatment of the fistula depends on the size and location of the fistula, the underlying disease, and any previous therapies. In regards to complicated recurrent rectovaginal fistulas, transposition of the gracilis muscle is one of the well-established therapeutic options with a success rate of up to 70%. Between 01\/2004 and 06\/2010, ten patients diagnosed with a recurrent rectovaginal fistula were treated in the surgical department of Klinikum Oldenburg by gracilis muscle transposition; their data were collected and analyzed. Post-operative evaluation was performed using a standardized telephone interview. All patients had a protective stoma. The primary endpoint of assessment was the long-term healing of the fistula following stoma reversal, and the comparison between those who were treated successfully versus those who were not. Over a time span of 6years, ten women with a complicated rectovaginal fistula underwent fistula repair with the gracilis muscle transposition. Patient age ranged from 29 and 64years. There were five rectovaginal fistulas, four pouch-vaginal fistulas, and one anovaginal fistula. The underlying disease was rectal cancer in seven patients, Crohn's disease in one patient, previous complicated gynecologic surgery in one patient, and idiopathic anal fistula in one patient. All seven patients with rectal cancer underwent radiochemotherapy with 50.4Gy (n=6 neo-adjuvant, n=1 adjuvant). All ten patients had previously undergone repair by a different surgical approach while five presented with a second or third recurrence. Post-operative complications were noted in two patients (perineal wound defect, thigh hematoma). Follow-up of the patients ranged from 8 to 60months. Recurrent rectovaginal fistula occurred in four patients. Evaluation of the data failed to identify statistically significant criteria for treatment failure of rectovaginal fistula repair. Our results are similar to previous studies in this area. For the majority of the patients, the gracilis muscle transposition was a long-term effective treatment of recurrent rectovaginal fistulas, however recurrences were noted in 40% of cases.

At this time, it is unclear whether the laparoscopic approach can be routinely proposed as a safe procedure for patients with complex CD involving localized abscess, fistula or recurrent disease. The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic surgery for complex or recurrent CD. In the current literature, there are nine non-randomized cohort studies, two of which were case-matched. The mean rate of conversion to open laparotomy reported in these series ranged from 7% to 42%. Morbidity rate and hospital stay following laparoscopic resection for complex CD were similar to those for initial resection or for non-complex CD. In summary, even though strong evidence is lacking and more contributions with larger size are needed, the limited experiences available from the literature confirm that the laparoscopic approach for complex CD is both feasible and safe in the hands of experienced IBD surgeons with extensive expertise in laparoscopic surgery. Further studies are required to confirm these results and determine precisely patient selection criteria.

The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and excess BMI loss (% EBL), obesity-related co-morbidities, and post-SG complications were evaluated at 2 years after SG based on our database, and at 5 years after SG based on a questionnaire sent to the patients by one of the authors (IB) between May 2011 and February 2012. A complete data set was obtained for 53 of 65 patients (82%), including 45 patients who had SG as the only surgical treatment, and eight patients who had a second bariatric procedure at a later date because of insufficient weight loss (five gastric bypass (GBP), three SG revision). For these 53 patients, the mean %EWL was 54.4% at 2 years and 53.7% at 5 years, and the mean %EBL was 61% at 2 years and 60% at 5 years. Three patients (5.7%) had post-operative complications (two fistulas (3.8%), one hemorrhage (1.9%)). Three trocar-site hernias (5.7%) were observed between 10 months and 34 months post-SG. Sub-group analysis of the 45 patients who underwent SG alone showed a mean %EWL of 57.1% at 2 years and 50.7% at 5 years; the mean %EBL was 64% at 2 years and 56.8% at 5 years. Of these 45 patients, 13 (28.9%) required medication to treat diabetes (DM) before SG and only five (11.1%) at 5 years after SG (61.5% decrease); 18 (40%) had antihypertensive treatment before SG, and eight (17.8%) at 5 years after SG (55.5% decrease); 12 (26.7%) took lipid-lowering medication before SG, and five (11.1%) at 5 years after SG (58.3% decrease); 24 (53.3%) had sleep apnea (SAS) before SG and six (17.8%) at 5 years after SG (75% decrease). However, while only five patients (11.1%) had GERD requiring PPI therapy before SG, 15 patients required PPI therapy (33.3%) at 5 years after SG (200% increase). Five years after performance of SG, weight loss was satisfactory, few complications were observed, the reduction of co-morbidities was significant, but there was an increase in the frequency of GERD. ","889":"Para-esophageal hernias are relatively rare and typically occur in elderly patients. The various presenting symptoms are non-specific and often occur in combination. These include symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) in 26 to 70% of cases, microcytic anemia in 17 to 47%, and respiratory symptoms in 9 to 59%. Respiratory symptoms are not completely resolved by surgical intervention. Acute complications such as gastric volvulus with incarceration or strangulation are rare (estimated incidence of 1.2% per patient per year) but gastric ischemia leading to perforation is the main cause of mortality. Only patients with symptomatic hernias should undergo surgery. Prophylactic repair to prevent acute incarceration should only be undertaken in patients younger than 75 in good condition; surgical indications must be discussed individually beyond this age. The laparoscopic approach is now generally accepted. Resection of the hernia sac is associated with a lower incidence of recurrence. Repair of the hiatus can be reinforced with prosthetic material (either synthetic or biologic), but the benefit of prosthetic repair has not been clearly shown. Results of prosthetic reinforcement vary in different studies; it has been variably associated with four times fewer recurrences or with no measurable difference. A Collis type gastroplasty may be useful to lengthen a foreshortened esophagus, but no objective criteria have been defined to support this approach. The anatomic recurrence rate can be as high as 60% at 12years. But most recurrences are asymptomatic and do not affect the quality of life index. It therefore seems more appropriate to evaluate functional results and quality of life measures rather than to gauge success by a strict evaluation of anatomic hernia reduction. ","890":"Penile metastases are very rare and arise most frequently from genitourinary cancers. Penile metastases from rectal adenocarcinoma are less common and only 50 or so cases have been reported. We present a 43-year-old man with penile metastases from a rectal adenocarcinoma. Two years before admittance to our department, abdomino-perineal resection of the rectum (Miles operation) was performed for a Dukes B (T3N0M0) rectal adenocarcinoma; the surgical resection margins wee negative. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment were administered. One year after initial management, excision of a local recurrence was performed followed by further chemotherapy. The patient subsequently noticed lesions of the penis measuring up to 1.2 cm in diameter. Biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography showed normal structure of penis with subcutaneous nodular thickening. Soon thereafter, the entire shaft of the penis becomes indurated and the patient developed urinary obstruction. A suprapubic cystostomy was performed. The patient died within 6 months. Penile metastases arise most frequently from genitourinary cancers, primarily from the bladder and the prostate gland. Metastasis to the penis from a rectal adenocarcinoma occurs much less commonly. Other reported primary origins of penile metastases include malignancies of the lung, nasopharynx and melanoma. The major symptoms are penile nodular mass, malignant priapism, penile pain and tenderness, difficulty in micturition, and urinary retention. Possible routes of metastasis are arterial, retrograde venous spread, retrograde lymphatic spread, but direct tumor infiltration\/extension is also possible. Penile metastases from rectal adenocarcinoma usually occur within 2 years after diagnosis of the primary tumor. The prognosis is very poor regardless of treatment modality. Treatment is more often palliative than curative. Survival usually varies from 7 months to 2 years. Long-term survival (9 years) has been seen after aggressive surgical treatment (penile amputation) with best results for patients when penile metastasis was the only evident region of recurrence. The prognosis of metastasis to the penis is very poor; the best results have been achieved with surgery but only for lesions where metastasis is limited to the penis. ","891":"Rectal resection with total mesorectal excision is the standard treatment for rectal cancers. Local excision represents an alternative with less post-operative mortality and morbidity and preservation of intestinal and bladder function. However, local excision cannot provide adequate nodal staging. Presently, endorectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are used to select the appropriate patients for local excision, those with limited T1 rectal tumors. There is general agreement that the ideal tumors for local excision are less or equal to 3 cm in diameter, superficial (usTis and\/or usT1N0), infra-peritoneal, located below the middle rectal valve, and involving no more than 40% of the rectal circumference. Transanal tumor excision is suitable for distal tumors and transanal endoscopic microsurgery for mid and upper lesions. The principles of adequate resection margin, non-fragmentation, and full-thickness excision are similar to those for any cancer resection. Unfavorable pathologic criteria, as assessed on the fixed rectal specimen, include depth of tumor invasion (submucosal [T1sm3] or muscular [T2]), positive resection margins, vascular and\/or lymphatic invasion, and poor differentiation. Further radical surgery is required in case of unfavorable criteria. Simple surveillance may be advised for superficial tumors (T1sm1) without any unfavorable criteria. Management of T1sm2 tumors without any unfavorable criteria should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.","892":null,"893":"","894":"","895":"","896":"Adjustable gastric banding is recognized for its effectiveness in obtaining long-term weight loss with low morbidity-mortality for patients with morbid obesity. However, life-threatening complications can sometimes occur, and surgeons may end up in court. We analyzed complications, some of them lethal, arising from gastric banding surgery in nine patients and the main issues identified by the experts, contributing to the judge's decision. Gastric banding is considered a benign operation, but, of the nine cases examined herein, five resulted in death while the other four had serious consequences with several damages, especially aesthetic and psychological suffering. Perforations of the oesophagus or stomach remain the leading causes of complications; the experts identified several issues from the records that helped the judge to render a decision and condemn seven of the nine surgeons. Three types of faults were considered the responsibility of the doctors: the lack of patient information or incomplete medical records, a clumsy mistake or delay of appropriate treatment due to underestimation of clinical symptoms, and finally, failure to observe the proper indications. Expert opinion focused most often on criticism of postoperative behaviour and failure to make decisions according to the state of the art. ","897":"Splenic metastases develop in less than 1% of all metastatic cancers, and typically occur in a setting of disseminated disease. When isolated splenic metastasis occurs, the patient may be a candidate for aggressive treatment consisting mainly of splenectomy as described in the literature. However, the increased incidence of post-operative morbidity and severe infection after splenectomy are well known. We report a case of splenic metastasis that developed from colorectal cancer and was treated by laparoscopic-guided radiofrequency ablation. We reviewed the few reported cases of splenic metastasis (from colorectal and other primary cancers) treated by thermal ablation using radiofrequency (RF) or microwave (MW) energy sources. Many studies have proved that thermal ablation for benign splenic pathology is both feasible and safe with no sacrifice in efficacy. However only a few cases of MW or RF treatment of splenic secondary tumor have been described; no complications have been reported with this treatment in contrast to the 15 to 27% morbidity rate for splenectomy. When treatment of splenic metastasis is proposed with curative intent, thermal ablation by RF or by MW seems to be a feasible and safe technique resulting in spleen conservation with a low morbidity rate. Because of these features, thermal ablation seems an ideal treatment modality to obliterate splenic metastasis and may be an indispensable tool in the armamentarium of modern splenic surgery. ","898":"Management of perforated gastro-duodenal ulcer (GDU) is not consensual, from no operative treatment to surgery by simple closure, gastrectomy and vagotomy. The purpose of this study is to report results of the literature concerning management of perforated GDU. Two authors, identified in the databases Pubmed and Embase studies, related to the therapeutic management of perforated GDU. The data were extracted from articles published between 1940 and 2012. Non-operative treatment is feasible for patients in good general condition and in good local circumstances without evolved peritonitis with a success rate more than 50%. Simple closure is the standard method. Laparoscopy is a safe and feasible method for patient with delay of treatment less than 24 hours and without associated complications with a success (meaning non conversion) of 80% and a mortality less than 1%. Rate of conversion is 7.9%, and increases in case of ulcer size &gt;6 mm, frail ulcer edges, bleeding associated, unusual location and septic shock. Helicobacter pylori eradication is essential. Gastric tube, abdominal irrigation and drainage are still debated. Two-stage treatment for perforated gastric carcinoma, which represents 10 to 16% of gastric perforation, is a good option for frail patients with resectable tumors. Management of perforated GDU is still a subject of debate without guidelines but with several possibilities of treatment depending of local circumstances of peritonitis and size of defect &gt;20 mm, general conditions, surgeon patterns and experience.

However, there may be potential benefits of performing prophylactic cholecystectomy during certain abdominal procedures for non-biliary disease; this remains a subject of debate. This debate has become livelier with the recent increase in bariatric surgery. Gastrectomy for cancer, small bowel resection, colonic resection, and splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis as well as all bariatric surgical interventions can all alter the physiology of gallstone disease raising the question of the value of PC, but the specific morbidity of cholecystectomy must be kept in mind. The purpose of this study was to report epidemiological and pathophysiological data and the results from literature reports in order to assess the value of concomitant prophylactic cholecystectomy during various common surgical situations. ","901":"Pilonidal disease is a frequent suppurative condition that occurs twice as often in men as in women, usually between the ages of 15 and 30. Pilonidal disease is located beneath the skin of the sacro-coccygeal region. It presents acutely as an abscess under tension while the chronic form gives rise to intermittent discharge from pilonidal sinus(es). Diagnosis is clinical and usually straightforward. In the large majority of cases, treatment is surgical but there is no consensus as to the 'ideal' technique. Acute abscess must be evacuated and an off-midline incision seems preferable. Excision is the standard definitive treatment but the choice of wide versus limited excision depends on the school of thought. The widespread practice in France is to leave the wound open, relying on postoperative healing by secondary intention. This technique has a low rate of recurrence but has the disadvantages of requiring local nursing care; the healing process is prolonged, usually associated with a temporary but prolonged cessation of activity. Primary wound closure techniques are less restrictive but their recurrence rate is probably higher. A direct midline suture is best after a small excision, but for a more extended wound, plastic reconstruction techniques are preferred; data in the literature favor asymmetric closure techniques such as those described by Karydakis and Bascom. ","902":"The role of routine intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) during cholecystectomy remains controversial. The purpose of this evidence-based review was to analyze the role of IOC in the prevention and detection of biliary ductal injury during cholecystectomy. The relative rarity of biliary complications means that the randomized trials and meta-analyses that include fewer than 12,000 patients cannot answer the question. Therefore, only six comparative studies were included in this review. The conclusions of these studies were conflicting, half showing a protective effect of routine IOC and the other half showing no effect. Nevertheless, the U.S. and Swedish studies that included the largest number of patients suggested that, while not a panacea, routine IOC could prevent major biliary injuries (one ductal injury per 500 cholecystectomies). Finally, in the context of risk management, we must also emphasize the educational value of teaching young (and not so young) surgeons how to correctly interpret the operative cholangiogram. ","903":"Endoscopic treatment has become, according to the latest recommendations, the standard treatment for common bile duct stones (CBDS), although in certain situations, surgical clearance of the common duct at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still considered a possible alternative. The purpose of this article is not to compare endoscopic with surgical treatment of CBDS, but to describe the various techniques of endoscopic treatment, detailing their preferential indications and the various treatment options that must sometimes be considered when faced with \"difficult calculi\" of the CBD. The different techniques of lithotripsy and the role of biliary drainage with plastic or metallic stents will be detailed as well as papillary balloon dilatation and particularly the technique of sphincterotomy with macrodilatation of the sphincter of Oddi (SMSO), a recently described approach that has changed the strategy for endoscopic management of CBDS. Finally, the overall strategy for endoscopic management of CBDS, with description of different techniques, will be exposed. ","904":"The duodenum is the second most common location of intestinal diverticula after the colon. Duodenal diverticulum (DD) is usually located in the second portion of the duodenum (D2), close to the papilla. Most duodenal diverticula are extraluminal and acquired rather than congenital; more rare is the congenital, intraluminal diverticulum. DD is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, but can become symptomatic in 1% to 5% of cases when complicated by gastroduodenal, biliary and\/or pancreatic obstruction, by perforation or by hemorrhage. Endoscopic treatment is the most common first-line treatment for biliopancreatic complications caused by juxtapapillary diverticula and also for bleeding. Conservative treatment of perforated DD based on fasting and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be offered in some selected cases when diagnosis is made early in stable patients, or in elderly patients with comorbidities who are poor operative candidates. Surgical treatment is currently reserved for failure of endoscopic or conservative treatment. The main postoperative complication of diverticulectomy is duodenal leak or fistula, which carries up to a 30% mortality rate. ","905":"Endoscopy has an ever-increasing role in the treatment of complications in digestive surgery. Endoscopic treatment is essentially used for (i) fistula or intra-abdominal collection secondary to anastomotic dehiscence and (ii) anastomotic stricture, especially esophagogastric, but also sometimes after colorectal surgery. First intention treatment of fistula following esophagogastric surgery is the insertion of an extractable self-expandable metallic stent (partially or entirely covered); this is supported by a low level of scientific evidence, but clinical experience has been satisfactory. Other techniques for treatment of anastomotic leak have also been reported anecdotally (clip placement, sealing with glue). There are few data available in the literature on endoscopic management (stents essentially) of postoperative colonic fistula. Whatever the approach chosen to treat a postoperative digestive tract fistula, management is medico-surgical and cannot be limited to simple closure of the digestive tube wall defect. Drainage of any collections by endoscopic, radiologic or surgical approach, systemic treatment of infection and nutritional support are essential adjuvant treatment modalities. Treatment of postoperative esophageal or colonic strictures is essentially endoscopic and is based on initial dilatation (endoscopic with hydrostatic balloon or bougie), and placement of extractable metallic stents (partially or entirely covered) in case of refractory outcome. ","906":"The cause of bile duct leaks can be either iatrogenic or more rarely, traumatic. The most common cause is related to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. While surgical repair has been the standard for many years, management in these often morbid and complex situations must currently be multidisciplinary incorporating the talents of interventional radiologists and endoscopists. Based on the literature and in particular the recent recommendations of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), this review aims to update the management strategy. The incidence of these complications decreases with surgeon experience attesting to the value of training to prevent these injuries. Bile duct injuries must be categorized and their mapping detailed by magnetic resonance cholangiography MRCP or endoscopic cholangiography (ERCP) when endoscopic therapy is considered. Endoscopic management should be preferred in the absence of complete circumferential interruption of the common bile duct. The ESGE recommends insertion of a plastic stent for 4 to 8 weeks without routine sphincterotomy. For complete circumferential injuries, hepaticojejunostomy is usually necessary. In conclusion, adequate training of surgeons is essential for prevention since the incidence of bile duct injury decreases with experience. Faced with a bile duct injury, a multidisciplinary team approach, involving radiologists, endoscopists and surgeons improves patient outcome. ","907":"","908":"","909":"Since the initial studies published in the eighties, percutaneous radiologic drainage, is considered the first-line treatment of infected post-operative collections and is successful in over 80% of patients. Mortality due to undrained abscesses is estimated between 45 and 100%. Radiology-guided percutaneous drainage can be performed either with curative intent or to improve patient status prior to re-operation under better conditions. Cross-sectional imaging, using either ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), has changed the management of post-operative complications. Percutaneous drainage is most often performed by interventional radiologists and imaging is essential for road-mapping and guiding the puncture and drainage of intra-abdominal collections. Indeed, such imaging allows both identification of adjacent anatomical structures and determination of the best tract and the safest route. Cooperation between the surgeon and the interventional radiologist is essential to optimize the management and to avoid, if possible, surgery, which is so often difficult in this setting. ","910":"Gastrostomy is the most efficient and best tolerated method of prolonged nutritional support. Jejunostomy is used more rarely. Indications for both techniques have increased because of progress in insertion techniques under endoscopic or radiologic guidance. The procedure is simple and rapid, performed under simple sedation with a success rate over 95% for gastrostomy, irrespective of the technique. Mortality directly related to the technique is less than 5%, but associated co-morbidity also explains a more variable but often higher 30-day mortality. Local care and maintenance of the catheter should help avoid most of the late complications such as peristomal leaks, local infection or sepsis of the tunneled catheter in the abdominal wall. The main indications are neurologic swallowing disorders, mechanical dysphagia from ENT or esophageal disease, when the expected duration of enteral nutrition is at least longer than 3 weeks. In patients with severe dementia, no benefit for either nutritional status or quality of life has been demonstrated.

The charts of all patients who underwent right colectomy by a totally laparoscopic approach in our service since 2004 were reviewed and pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were collected. Eighty-two patients underwent totally laparoscopic right colectomy; of these, 32 had a BMI greater than 20 kg\/m2 (39%). The mean operative duration was 113 minutes. In most cases, the operative specimen was extracted through a supra-pubic Pfannenstiel incision measuring 4-6 cm in length. Three cases were converted to a laparoscopy-assisted technique (in order to control the ileo-cecal vascular pedicle because of extensive nodal invasion in two cases, and to evaluate a hepatic flexure polyp in the third case). Overall morbidity was 29.3% and parietal morbidity was only 9.8%; there was no difference in morbidity between obese patients (BMI&gt;30 kg\/m2) and non-obese patients (BMI&lt;30 kg\/m2). The mean duration of hospitalization was 9 days and two patients developed ventral hernia in the extraction incision in long-term follow-up. These satisfactory results show that the totally laparoscopic approach to right colectomy is technically feasible and safe, even in obese patients. In addition, the very low rate of parietal complications is an argument in favor of this approach. ","914":"The two most common early complications of thyroid surgery are hypocalcemia (20-30%) and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (5-11%). Bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis resulting in adduction of the vocal cords is a rare life-threatening complication (occurring in less than 0.1% of cases that requires emergency management. Prevention of complications depends on careful operative technique and is enhanced for some teams by the use of specific techniques such as intraoperative neuromonitoring. Postsurgical hypocalcemia is managed by the administration of calcium plus vitamin D for at least 10 days. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis recovers in most cases, and no invasive therapy should be performed for at least six months, except for emergency presentations; laryngeal surgery techniques may offer significant improvement if phonation or respiratory sequelae persist beyond six months, but the results are inconsistent. There should be a systematic strategy for detection of complications after thyroidectomy involving a multidisciplinary approach. ","915":"Cervical hematoma with airway compromise is a severe complication that may be rapidly lethal or result in irreversible cerebral anoxia if the hematoma is not urgently decompressed. It is therefore indispensable to know the essential relevant elements as well as predictive criteria for this complication before envisioning ambulatory thyroidectomy. The Association francophone de chirurgie endocrinienne (AFCE) sought to answer several questions raised by the proposal of ambulatory thyroidectomy and to propose recommendations based on a review of the literature, an inquiry sent out to members of the AFCE, and an in-depth research of the medicolegal risks involved, based essentially on jurisprudence. The details scrutinized included preoperative selection criteria, the characteristics of the operation and the basic elements of postoperative surveillance. The standard today is at least an overnight hospital stay. In fact, hospital stay can be less than 24h because the risk of cervical compressive hematoma is very unusual beyond this interval. Ambulatory (outpatient) thyroidectomy (0 nights) is possible under certain conditions for highly selected patients according to criteria described in the literature that also define relative contra-indications. In case of life-threatening or functional complications, the surgeon stands first in the line of responsibility. The surgeon must therefore ensure that the patient and family were fully informed of the contra-indications, the normal course of postoperative events, of pertinent elements of postoperative surveillance and of the conditions under which the patient can be safely discharged. The surgeon must also realize that this type of management is time-consuming.

The objective of the present study was to assess the role of excision of port-sites from the initial LC for patients with incidental gallbladder carcinoma (IGBC) in a French registry. Data on patients with IGBC identified after LC between 1998 and 2008 were retrospectively collated in a French multicenter database. Among those patients undergoing re-operation with curative intent, patients with port-site excision (PSE) were compared with patients without PSE and analyzed for differences in recurrence patterns and survival. Among 218 patients with IGBC after LC (68 men, 150 women, median age 64 years), 148 underwent re-resection with curative intent; 54 patients had PSE and 94 did not. Both groups were comparable with regard to demographic data (gender, age &gt; 70, co-morbidities), surgical procedures (major resection, lymphadenectomy, main bile duct resection) and postoperative morbidity. In the PSE group, depth of tumor invasion was T1b in six, T2 in 24, T3 in 22, and T4 in two; this was not significantly different from patients without PSE (P = 0.69). Port-site metastasis was observed in only one (2%) patient with a T3 tumor who died with peritoneal metastases 15 months after resection. PSE did not improve the overall survival (77%, 58%, 21% at 1, 3, 5 years, respectively) compared to patients with no PSE (78%, 55%, 33% at 1, 3, 5 years, respectively, P = 0.37). Eight percent of patients developed incisional hernia at the port-site after excision. In patients with IGBC, PSE was not associated with improved survival and should not be considered mandatory during definitive surgical treatment. ","918":"The most serious early complication after rectal resection with low anastomosis is anastomotic leakage (AL). AL may compromise the long-term conservation of the anastomosis and also worsen oncological results. The aim of this review was to identify those factors that contribute to the prevention of AL and to delineate the various treatment options (endoscopic, perineal surgical approach, abdominal surgical approach) for chronic AL or anastomotic stricture. Treatments for AL or anastomotic stricture should be protected by proximal diversion of fecal flow, ideally by a diverting stoma created at the time of the initial proctectomy. Local approaches to surgical treatment should include perineal examination under general anesthesia by the surgeon and drainage of the fistula. Trans-abdominal interventions should be reserved for high AL and for failure of perineal procedures. Although they have only limited indications for the treatment of AL, endoscopic treatments can be used in a complementary manner to surgical treatment. Balloon dilation is the first-line treatment for anastomotic strictures.

Surgery is an invasive and often irreversible alternative that offers substantial and durable weight loss at the price of non-negligible morbidity and mortality. Three procedures account for almost all bariatric surgical procedures in France: adjustable gastric banding (AGB), vertical or sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and gastric bypass (GBP). The goal of this review is to help the surgeon make the best choice among these procedures, depending on his surgical convictions, abilities, and habits. Evidence-based data were extracted from the literature using the major data-base resources (Medline, Web of knowledge, Scopus); as well the most recent recommendations from relevant learned societies and health care organisms were analyzed. In 2010, 26,558 bariatric operations were performed in France; these were more or less equally distributed between AGB, SG and GBP. In 2011, the proportion of SG increased enormously and represented 43.9% of all bariatric procedures. In terms of weight loss and perioperative morbidity\/mortality, SG tends to stand midway between AGB and GBP.","921":"Local recurrence (LR) after curative surgery for rectal cancer occurs in 4 to 33% of cases especially with suboptimal surgery (non-TME). For numerous patients, diagnosis of LR is done at late stage of the disease because of the high rate of asymptomatic patients. MRI and PET-scan are the most performing exams to assess the local and general extension, with high diagnostic accuracy (sensibility 85% and specificity 92%). For extraluminal pelvic recurrences from rectal cancer, pelvic exenterations alone or with irradiation (preoperative and\/or intraoperative) can afford a R0 resection rate ranging from 30% to 45% with acceptable morbidity. Morbidity and mortality rates are high for total exenteration and abdominosacral resection. After curative surgery, 5-year global survival from 30% to 40% is observed. Careful selection of patients with better preoperative status before resection is needed to achieve more curative resections and increase long-term survivor rates.","922":"","923":"","924":"Patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma often develop biliary and\/or duodenal obstruction during the course of their disease.

The success rate for placement of duodenal and biliary stents is greater than 90% with low morbidity. Classical surgical bypass surgery includes biliary-digestive and gastro-jejunal anastomoses.

However, the quality of available data on the effectiveness of minilaparotomy to treat choledocholithiasis is poor. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with choledocholithiasis underwent surgical exploration of the common bile duct via minilaparotomy from 1995 to 2010. Of these, 193 patients had choledocho\/cholecystolithiasis with previous ineffective attempts at endoscopic clearance and 29 patients had choledocho\/cholecystolithiasis without previous attempts at endoscopic clearance. Six other patients had recurrent\/residual choledocholithiasis despite ineffective attempts at endoscopic clearance. Peri-operative adverse events were analyzed in accordance with the revised Satava classification for intra-operative events while post-operative complications were graded according to the Accordion classification. Conversion was needed in 3.9% of procedures. The mean operative time was 86 min. Post-operative complications occurred in 6.1%, 2.2% of which were major (Accordion grade 4-6). Mortality was 0.9%. Minilaparotomy is an effective minimally invasive approach for the surgical treatment of choledocholithiasis. This approach could be considered as an alternative to the laparoscopic approach for surgical exploration of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis. ","934":"Incidentally discovered cystic tumors of the pancreas (CTP) are an increasingly frequent entity. It is essential to differentiate lesions whose malignant potential is either nil or negligible (pseudocyst, serous cystadenoma, simple cysts) from lesions with intermediate malignant potential (intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas [IPMN] involving the secondary ducts, cystic endocrine tumor) or those with high malignant potential (mucinous cystadenoma, solid pseudopapillary tumors and IPMN involving the main pancreatic duct). The approach to defining malignant potential is based on diagnostic CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), often complemented by EUS-guided cyst puncture for biochemical and cytological analysis of cyst fluid. Surgery for diagnostic purposes should be avoided because of its significant morbidity. For pseudocysts, simple cysts and serous cystadenomas, abstention is the general rule. Resection, preserving as much pancreatic parenchyma as possible, is the rule for IPMN involving the main pancreatic duct, mucinous cystadenomas, solid and pseudopapillary tumors, and cystic endocrine tumors. Resection is rarely indicated at the outset for IPMN involving secondary pancreatic ducts; morphologic observation is the general rule and preventive excision may be indicated secondarily. Good collaboration between surgeons, radiologists and endosonographists is necessary for optimal management of CTP.","935":"We report a case of synovial sarcoma of the pancreas in a 44-year-old male who presented with multiple episodes of retroperitoneal hemorrhage; the diagnosis was confirmed by histology.

As ischemia is often transient and clinical symptoms are reversible, its exact incidence is unknown. In current clinical practice, two types of IC are described according to the severity: severe IC, with transmural colonic ischemia and\/or multi-organ failure (MOF), and mild IC, without MOF and spontaneous favourable evolution in most cases. Two clinical contexts are encountered: spontaneous IC (SIC) and postoperative IC (POIC), mainly after aortic surgery. As there is no specific clinico-biologic symptom of IC, emergent CT-scan and rectosigmoidoscopy are required for diagnosis confirmation, surgical decision and prognosis analysis. IC surgical treatment is not consensual but can be standardized according to organ function and the degree of ischemia: surgical treatment in case of colonic necrosis with deep ischemia and\/or MOF; observation for superficial ischemia without organ dysfunction; systematic medical care.

Empirically selected broad spectrum antibiotic therapy (with a defined duration, dosage and administration route) should be prescribed according to the severity of the cholecystitis, an associated history of recent antibiotic therapy, and local bacterial susceptibility patterns.

Postoperative complications, weight loss, evolution of co-morbidities and quality of life were analyzed. The Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) was used to classify outcomes. There were 15 women and five men (median age: 37.5 years). Median BMI was 63 kg\/m2. Median duration of operation was 180 minutes. One patient was converted to laparotomy. Three complications occurred: one grade I, one grade II and one grade V. The median excess weight loss was 47.1% at 12 months, 55.3% at 24 months, 53.3% at 36 months and 55.3% at 48 months. Among the patients with a follow-up of at least 12 months (n=17), the median quality of life score was 1.75 and the median BAROS score was 5.75. Arterial hypertension and type II diabetes resolved or improved in all patients and sleep apnea resolved in almost half of patients (43%).

The first patient had liver metastases secondary to previously resected malignant glucagonoma and the second, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. We used bevacizumab in association with melphalan for HILP because of the additional effect of an anti-VEGF antibody in these highly vascularized tumors and its locally restricted delivery to the isolated hepatic vascular compartment despite of its classic contraindication in association with surgery. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee. Enhanced CT scans during follow-up showed complete tumor necrosis as early as the second postoperative day. Patients had 27 and 7 months disease-free survival and 48 and 41 months overall survival after HILP, for neuroendocrine liver metastases and HILP plus liver transplantation for HCC respectively.

This prospective study compared the occurrence of incidents related to equipment, patient installation and the time loss attributed to these incidents, before and after the initiation of a preoperative checklist. Two hundred consecutive laparoscopic procedures (appendectomies and cholecystectomies) were studied; the first hundred without the preoperative checklist and the second hundred after the initiation of this laparoscopic checklist. The risk of at least one incident to occur during the procedure was increased 3-fold ([1.36 vs. 6.64], P=0.007) when the checklist was not used compared to when the preoperative checklist was used. Likewise, the number of incidents increased 2.4-fold ([1.15; 5.01], P=0.02), compared to when the preoperative checklist was used. The checklist significantly reduced the proportion of incidences during which time was lost from 22% to 10% (P=0.03).

Multicenter prospective study concerning 105 consecutive patients operated between December 2009 and February 2011 by SILC for non-complicated gallstones. Perioperative and postoperative parameters were analyzed with a systematic follow-up at 1 and 6months postoperative. Conversion to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) was required for six patients (5.7%). Conversion rate is higher in case of acute cholecystitis (25%, P&lt;0.001). Cosmetic outcome is found excellent by the patient (in 86% of the cases at 6months) and by the surgeon (in 90% of the cases at 6months) using an EVA scale. An incisional hernia was found in two cases (1.9%) and a superficial wound infection in four cases (3.8%). The cosmetic outcome after SILC is found excellent. SILC has its place in the surgical management of the non-complicated gallstone. We did not notice higher level of peroperative complications (biliary tract injury) during SILC than during CLC. Postoperative higher level of abdominal wall complications than after a CLC makes the surgeon caution to a careful abdominal wall closure.

The incidence ranges from 2% to 20% and varies greatly from one series to another. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and preventive measures for ventral incisional hernia. An analysis of the surgical literature was performed using the search engines EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed with the keywords: abdominal hernia, wound dehiscence, incisional hernia, incidence, trocar site hernia, and hernia prevention. The overall incidence of incisional hernia after laparotomy was 9.9%. The incidence was significantly higher for midline incisions compared with transverse incisions (11% vs. 4.7%; P=0.006). In contrast, the incidence of ventral hernia was only 0.7% after laparoscopy. A compilation of all the studies comparing laparotomy to laparoscopy showed a significantly higher incidence of incisional hernia after laparotomy (P=0.001). Independent risk factors for incisional hernia included age and infectious complications. Only two meta-analyses were able to show a significant decrease in risk-related to the use of non absorbable or slowly absorbable suture material. No difference in incisional hernia risk was shown with different suture techniques (11.1% for running suture, 9.8% for interrupted sutures: NS). A review of the literature shows that only the choice of incisional approach (transverse incision or laparotomy vs. midline laparotomy) allows a significant decrease in the incidence of ventral incisional hernia. ","953":"The results of laparoscopic treatment of rectal cancer have been evaluated in several randomized trials. Still, the validity of this approach remains controversial because of concerns regarding its oncological safety. In this review, oncological results of laparoscopic rectal resection were similar to those of laparotomy, with no observed survival difference. Conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy seemed to be associated with worse oncological results and an increased post-operative morbidity including nervous sequelae. Intra-operative blood loss was significantly reduced with the laparoscopic approach, but post-operative morbidity was not different. Post-operative pain and length of hospital stay were decreased by the laparoscopic approach, and short-term quality of life was improved. There was no demonstration of significant reduction in late morbidity such as incisional hernia and bowel adhesions.","954":"Intestinal transplantation (IT) can involve small bowel transplantation alone, or be associated with liver or multivisceral transplantation. Although IT is the radical treatment for intestinal failure, home parenteral nutrition (PN) remains the treatment of choice for this disease. Indications for IT are still debated. A recent study showed that early referral for IT is recommended for patients with life-threatening combined liver and intestinal failure or for patients with invasive intra-abdominal desmoid tumors. In the same study, no survival benefit was shown for patients undergoing IT for ultra-short bowel or major complications related to the PN catheter; indications still need to be fully assessed. While short-term outcomes for IT have improved dramatically (one-year survival for small bowel-alone IT is now 80% versus 0-28% in the 1980s), long-term outcomes have not improved much since the introduction of Tacrolimus in the 1990s: five-year survival still does not exceed 60%.

The various implants can be synthetic, biologic or mixed: their physicochemical properties condition the mechanical results and the long-term outcome of the repair. The increasing number of available materials allows the surgeon to choose between a wide variety depending on the indication, the site of implantation, the surgical approach and whether the operative field is contaminated or not. With regard to evidence-based medicine, while several synthetic implants have been shown to be superior in efficacy to simple suture, other studies are underway to develop the indications for bioprostheses, in particular in contaminated fields. This review of the literature summarizes the current knowledge on synthetic and biologic implants (physicochemical characteristics, forms, indications).","958":"Incisional hernia is one of the classic complications after abdominal surgery. The chronic, gradual increase in size of some of these hernias is such that the hernia ring widens to a point where there is a loss of substance in the abdominal wall, herniated organs can become incarcerated or strangulated while poor abdominal motility can alter respiratory function. The surgical treatment of small (&lt;5 cm) incisional hernias is safe and straightforward, by either laparotomy or laparoscopy. For large hernias, surgical repair is often difficult. After reintegration of herniated viscera into the abdominal cavity, the abdominal wall defect must be closed anatomically in order to restore the function to the abdominal wall. Prosthetic reinforcement of the abdominal wall is mandatory for long-term successful repair. There are multiple techniques for prosthetic hernia repair, but placement of Dacron mesh in the retromuscular plane is our preference.","959":"Repair of the abdominal wall is the last stage of abdominal surgery; pariet complications, particularly infection, can have serious impact on operative results. While abdominal wound infections are not universally preventable, they are often predictable; the aphorism of Jean Rives (Stoppa, 1999 [1]) summarizes this sequence: \"Infection is the mother of postoperative incisional hernia and infection of the incisional hernia repair is the grand-daughter\". Repair of the abdominal wall in a potentially septic milieu requires the solution of an equation involving four variables: mechanism of sepsis, its severity, the surgical approach, and choice of prosthetic material. These interdependent variables potentiate each other, requiring adaptations of surgical strategy that cannot be absolutely determined pre-operatively, even with collegial consultation.","960":"","961":"","962":"In clean surgery (Altemeier Class I), the incidence of infections is not increased by the placement of prosthetic material. Prosthetic mesh infections occur more frequently and are more serious in ventral incisional repair than in inguinal hernia repair. While removal of the mesh resolves the infectious problem, it creates other problems that are equally difficult. This underscores the need to: explore other conservative hernia treatment options; in the end, these are often feasible; respect and implement strict measures to prevent infection.","963":"Despite advances in surgery including new prosthetic materials and the advent of laparoscopy, the treatment of parastomal hernias remains a challenge for the surgeon. This is mainly due to the very high recurrence rate. Adequate management requires preoperative multidisciplinary consultation to offer the most appropriate surgical solution to each patient. We propose a review of current knowledge about this complication.","964":"Umbilical hernia (UH) is the most frequent abdominal wall complication of ascites in cirrhotic patients. Treatment to control ascites, which mainly consists of repeated paracentesis or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), is mandatory; otherwise the risk of hernia recurrence is very high. Nowadays, surgical portosystemic shunts are rarely performed. Classically, hernia repair was offered only to patients with symptomatic UH, but presently, even if the hernia is minimally symptomatic, there is tendency to perform elective repair to avoid emergency surgery for complications associated with very high mortality and morbidity rates (rupture and strangulation). If liver transplantation is indicated, treatment of UH can be performed simultaneously, unless the hernia is highly symptomatic or complicated or if the waiting time on the transplantation list is long. During repair, necrotic skin tissue should be excised; the use of prosthetic material (if the defect is large) is possible with a low risk of infection as long as ascites is sterile. The advantage of laparoscopic repair of large UH is to avoid any skin incision (precluding ascitic fluid leak) and avoid exposing prosthetic mesh to necrotic infected tissue. If the defect is small, UH repair can be performed under local anesthesia.","965":"","966":"Surgical patient is a stressed patient. Aggression is more intense and prolonged as surgery is important. Surgery induces secretion of stress hormones, inflammatory mediators and metabolic changes resulting in significant catabolic phenomena. The presence of malnutrition is an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. Malnutrition increases morbidity (infections, delayed healing), mortality, length of stay and costs and impacts human quality of life for patients. It has been shown that the management of perioperative malnutrition reduces the additional risk generated by it. Perioperative nutritional support should not be systematically provided. Since 1994, recommendations on perioperative nutrition, the care of patients and the available resources have changed dramatically. An update of these recommendations was needed. In 2010, an expert panel of the French society of Anesthesiology (SFAR) and the French-speaking society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNEP) has made recommendations for good clinical practice of perioperative nutrition. They are presented. Thus, the perioperative nutritional management must be integrated in a process to reduce the operative risk: risk reduction due to preoperative malnutrition, reduced risk of postoperative malnutrition which may compromise the following treatments, reduction of postoperative metabolic complications, reducing the postoperative morbidity, especially infectious, through the use of pharmaconutrients either preoperatively or postoperatively in some patients.","967":null,"968":"Anastomotic leakage is the most important complication after colorectal surgery. Its prognosis depends on its early diagnosis. C-reactive protein (CRP) has already shown its usefulness for the early detection of anastomotic leaks. Procalcitonin (PCT) is widely used in intensive care units and is more expensive, but its usefulness in the postoperative period of digestive surgery is not well established. Between May 2010 and June 2011, 100 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were prospectively included in a database. CRP and PCT were measured before surgery and daily until postoperative day 4. All intraabdominal infections were considered as anastomotic leaks, regardless of their clinical impact and their management. The kinetics of PCT and CRP were recorded, as well as their accuracy for the detection of anastomotic fistula. The incidence of fistula was 13% and the overall mortality rate was 2%. Both CRP and PCT were significantly higher in patients with leakage. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) for CRP were higher than those for PCT each day. The best accuracy was obtained for CRP on postoperative day 4 (areas under the ROC curve were 0.869 for CRP and 0.750 for PCT). Procalcitonin is neither earlier nor more accurate than CRP for the detection of anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.

The case of a 65-year-old woman with a multilocular cystic hepatic tumor is reported. Radiological and laboratory findings suggested the diagnosis of cystadenoma with localized malignant degeneration. A surgical resection of hepatic Segment I was performed, requiring total vascular exclusion (TVE) of the liver and a needle aspiration of a non-degenerated cyst to permit total resection. TVE and decompression of a cyst presumed to be benign may be warranted to achieve a safe and complete resection of biliary cystadenoma.

The management strategy depends on the hemodynamic status of the patient (stable, unstable or extremely unstable). Open trauma requires specific treatment in addition to control of bleeding. All surgical centers can be confronted some day with patients with hemorrhagic PPT and for this reason, all surgeons should be familiar with the initial management. In expert centers, management of patients with severe PPT is complex, multidisciplinary and often requires several re-interventions. Obstetrical and sexual trauma, also requiring specific management, will not be dealt with herein.","978":"There are very few studies evaluating the efficacy of sleeve gastrectomy on the metabolic syndrome, truly a worldwide pandemic. The main objective of this study was to retrospectively determine the evolution of the metabolic syndrome and its associated comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia) at 24 months after sleeve gastrectomy. The secondary objective was to determine the predictive factors for resolution of this syndrome. Between July 2004 and February 2008, 241 patients with morbid obesity (males: 17%) underwent sleeve gastrectomy in our center. Patients were seen in combined medical and surgical outpatient postoperative follow-up consultation at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Patients were classed as responders or not, according to whether or not the metabolic syndrome (as defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III [NCEP-ATPIII]) disappeared at 24 months follow-up. Thirty-six patients (15% of all patients, 30% of males) presented initially with metabolic syndrome. Twenty-six patients (72%) still had metabolic syndrome at 6 months, 17 patients (47%) at 12 months, and 13 patients (36%) at 24 months. The main parameters that regressed after sleeve gastrectomy were type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. In univariate analysis, only one parameter (systolic blood pressure) appeared to be a factor of non-resolution of the metabolic syndrome at 24 months. Our study showed that sleeve gastrectomy reduced the incidence of the metabolic syndrome and several of its components. ","979":"Mesenteric tumors are rare and consist of a heterogeneous group of lesions. Masses may arise from any of the mesenteric components: peritoneum, lymphatic tissue, fat, and connective tissue. Cellular proliferation can also arise from infectious or inflammatory processes. They can be classified as solid or cystic, benign or malignant. Mesenteric tumors are usually discovered incidentally or during investigation of non-specific symptoms. While clinical examination and imagery may suffice to make the diagnosis, histopathology is often required by either needle percutaneous or surgical biopsy, or immediate excision. Therapeutic management options vary widely depending on the nature of the lesion; they range from simple observation or medical therapy to surgery. Benign well-delineated mesenteric masses that are symptomatic can often be treated by simple enucleation. But invasive malignant tumors require a carcinologic resection; a careful preoperative evaluation to assess the relationship between the mass and adjacent vascular and digestive structures is essential since they may dictate the need for extensive sacrifice of bowel with resultant intestinal insufficiency due to short bowel syndrome.","980":"Mesenteric cystic lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor.

The therapeutic options remain the same, i.e. appendectomy. We present a series of 29 pregnant women who underwent surgery for acute appendicitis over a period of 10 years. The mean age was 28.6 years. Mean gravidity was 1.75 and mean parity was 0.84. The average period of gestation was 18 weeks and 5 days since the last menses. Seven patients underwent surgery during the 1st trimester, 15 during the 2nd trimester, and seven during the 3rd trimester. Eighteen patients underwent appendectomy through a laparoscopic approach and 11 through a McBurney incision. The postoperative course was uncomplicated in 27 patients. Two patients miscarried in the week following surgery. Acute appendicitis puts both maternal and fetal prognosis at risk. Management should be prompt and undertaken by a multidisciplinary team approach. Morbidity and mortality are not negligible. ","983":"","984":"Obesity has become a major public health concern. More and more patients with substantial obesity require surgery including complex hepatobiliary interventions. The morphology of these patients can make surgery difficult, especially in terms of exposure. We report the case of an obese patient who required a left hemihepatectomy for colorectal liver metastasis. It was very difficult to obtain adequate exposure; this problem was solved by transcutaneous introduction of the handle of a broad costal margin retractor. We describe this maneuver, which allowed us to carry out the intervention under excellent conditions.","985":"Bronchogenic cysts are benign congenital malformations usually. A retroperitoneal location is extremely uncommon. We reported a case of bronchogenic cyst occurred in the retroperitoneum in a 60-year-old patient. An abdominal CT for a prostatic adenocarcinoma staging has reported this incidental lesion. Biological, radiological and histological assessment confirmed the bronchogenic cyst diagnosis. The treatment of choice for most authors is surgical excision. However, because of a low malignant transformation risk, we have chosen a follow-up with abdominal computerized tomography every 6 months. During 3 years, biological and radiological assessments have shown a stable lesion. Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose a simple radiological monitoring for bronchogenic cysts in selected patients.","986":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Developed on a pathological liver in 90% of cases, theoretically liver transplantation (LT) is its best treatment because it cures both malignancy and cause of malignancy, the underlying pathological liver. Cadaveric donors are the main source of liver in Western countries as France and living donors are the rules in Eastern countries as Japan. Because organ shortage could impact choices in HCC treatments, it was interesting to compare a Western and Eastern surgeon's points of view about treatment of HCC to assess if the source of organs has modified therapeutic strategies. Hence, aim of this work was to compare points of view of two hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons specialized in the treatment of HCC in France and Japan concerning five keys points that are decisive to choose one of the two curative treatments in HCC on pathological liver: liver resection or LT. These questions included the definition of an oncological treatment of HCC, the assessment of liver function, the treatment of HCC recurrences, the incidence of pathological information on therapeutic strategy and potential future therapeutics strategies.","987":"The significance of complete calcification of liver metastases on imaging is unknown. This study was conducted to determine whether complete calcification of liver metastases after chemotherapy, as assessed by imaging, was synonymous with sterilization of disease. Imaging by triphasic contrast-enhanced helical CT scan and abdominal ultrasound showed complete calcification of eight liver metastases in four patients after systemic chemotherapy. All eight completely calcified liver metastases were resected within four weeks of imaging. Histological and surgical findings were analyzed to see whether there was any correlation between radiological and pathological status for completely calcified liver metastases. The pretreatment median diameter at initial imaging of the eight liver metastases that became completely calcified after chemotherapy was 24 mm. In all eight resected calcified liver metastases, pathological examination showed the presence of residual viable tumor cells. Most of the tumor volume was occupied by calcification, necrosis and fibrosis; but small discrete islands of viable tumor cells were detected at the periphery of lesions. This preliminary study shows that although imaging evidence of complete calcification of liver metastases may be a good indicator of chemotherapy response, it does not imply sterilization of the malignancy.

Abdominal ultrasound showed an abdominal mass in 11 cases. Ileo-ileal intussusception was most frequent (16 cases). Intussusception was secondary in 24 cases. There were seven instances of intestinal necrosis. Intestinal resection was performed in 34 cases. Surgical site infection occurred in four patients, three patients died. The pre-operative diagnosis of acute intestinal intussusception is difficult. Morbidity and mortality rates are high.

Abdominal CT scan with multi-planar reconstructions led to the diagnosis of an intestinal obstruction due to impaction of a large gallstone in the second portion of the duodenum. The CT scan demonstrated a large cholecysto-duodenal fistula as the origin of the gallstone migration. Surgical treatment consisted of milking the stone down beyond the ligament of Treitz, where it was removed through a jejunal enterotomy. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. No attempt was made to repair the choledocho-duodenal fistula at the initial intervention nor subsequently, and there have been no complications due to the fistula over 36 months of follow-up observation.","993":"","994":"","995":"The standard treatment of locally-advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma consists of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Very little data are available concerning the feasibility of this strategy in patients older than 70 years of age. Between 1996 and 2008, 118 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia (Siewert I and II). These were divided into three groups for comparison: Group I (age less than 70 years, neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery; n=66); Group II (age greater or equal to 70 years, surgery alone; n=32); Group III (age greater or equal to 70 years, neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery; n=20). Data concerning comorbidities, type of intervention, morbidity, mortality, survival and quality of life were analyzed. There was no difference among the three groups with regard to comorbidity and preoperative evaluation. The patients in Groups I and III had more locally-advanced tumors (P&lt;0.001). There was some disparity between the types of surgery proposed. The Lewis-Santy esophagectomy was most commonly used (90%, 50%, and 65% respectively). The 90-day mortality was 8%, 15%, and 15% respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of postoperative pulmonary, cardiac, or digestive complications among the three groups. No difference was found in 5-year survival and quality of life. Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for elderly patients (age above 70 years) with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not seem to increase postoperative morbidity or mortality, nor was there any difference in quality of life, nor any effect on survival, no matter what the age of the patient.

These intestinal metastases are mainly the small intestine; colon is a rare achievement. We report a case of small intestine metastatic of a tubulo-pappilary carcinoma revealed by a multiple intussusception a year after nephrectomy. The cross-sectional imaging (ultrasound and CT) was the gold standard for positive diagnosis of intussusception and the nature of secondary underlying tumor. Intestinal metastases of renal cell carcinoma sometimes occur many years after nephrectomy.

Colonoscopy revealed a submucosal mass suggestive of a benign tumor but that was too large for endoscopic resection. CT scan demonstrated an endoluminal fatty mass in the transverse colon, typical of lipoma, and suggested colo-colonic intussusception due to the mass. The mass was removed laparoscopically. Recovery was uneventful.","1000":"External drainage of the common bile duct by placement of a T-tube is a common practice after choledochotomy. This practice may result in the specific complication of bile peritonitis due to leakage after removal of the T-tube. This complication has multiple causes: some are patient-related (corticotherapy, chemotherapy, ascites), and others are due to technical factors (inappropriate suturing of the drain to the ductal wall, minimal inflammatory reaction related to some drain materials). The clinical presentation is quite variable depending on the amount and rapidity of intra-peritoneal spread of of bile leakage. Abdominal ultrasound (US), with US-guided needle aspiration and occasionally Technetium(99) scintigraphy are useful for diagnosis. Traditional therapy consists of surgical intervention including peritoneal lavage and re-intubation of the choledochal fistulous tract to allow for a further period of external drainage. When leakage is walled off and well-tolerated, a more nuanced and less invasive conservative therapy may combine percutaneous drainage with endoscopic placement of a trans-ampullary biliary drainage.","1001":"Surgery is the only curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), but resection should be total with tumor-free margins and the remaining parenchyma, functionally evaluated. The rationale behind portal vein embolization (PVE) to reduce the risk of these hepatic resections is threefold: (i) surgery for CRLM has become more and more aggressive, and hepatocellular insufficiency represents the leading cause of mortality after major hepatectomy for hepatic metastasis (HM), (ii) underlying hepatic disease occurs more frequently than previously thought in these patients having undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and can alter hepatic function and\/or hinder postoperative regeneration, and (iii) the operative risk is increased if major hepatectomy is associated with resection of the primary tumor. The goal of this update is to review the reasons behind and the indications for PVE, to analyze the literature pertaining to whether PVE should be routine or selective, and to tackle certain technical aspects, all within the framework of the treatment of CRLM.","1002":"","1003":"","1004":"","1005":"","1006":"Internal hernias account for less than 1% of acute mechanical bowel obstruction.

A cohort of 186 patients with a BMI greater or equal to 50 kg\/m(2) who underwent adjustable gastric banding (AGB) at the Bichat-Claude-Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) were prospectively entered into a database. The following data were recorded: BMI, percentage of BMI loss, percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL), complications, and surgical re-interventions. Loss of greater than 50% of excess weight was considered a success (primary endpoint). A %EWL of less than 25% after one year, or the removal of the gastric band was considered a failure. Thirty-five men (18.8%) and 151 women (81.2%), with a mean age of 38.9 years (range: 16-65) underwent AGB between September 1995 and December 2007. The mean BMI was 55.06 kg\/m(2) (range: 50-74.4). Mean follow-up was 112.5 months with a minimum of 28 months and a maximum of 172 months. The follow-up rate was maintained at 89% at ten years. The technique of AGB was by \"peri-gastric dissection\" in the first 115 patients (61.82%) and by \"pars flaccida dissection\" in 71 patients (38.17%). The gastric band was removed in 87 of 186 patients (46.8%); band ablation was due to a complication of the gastric band in 62 of these cases (33.3%), to failure of weight loss in 23 cases (12.4%), and to patient request in two cases (1%). The major complications requiring re-operation were: chronic dilatation of the proximal gastric pouch (27 patients - 14.5%), acute dilatation (21 patients - 11.3%), intragastric migration of the prosthesis (six patients - 3.2%), reflux esophagitis (six patients - 3.2%), infection of the gastric band (one patient - 0.5%), and Barrett's esophagus (one patient - 0.5%). No statistically significant difference was found between the two operative techniques with regard to the possibility of preserving the gastric band for ten years. For patients who underwent band removal, no further follow-up analysis of patient data after band ablation was performed. The results were best at two years after AGB with a median BMI of 42.72 kg\/m(2), a band removal rate of 8.6% (16 of 186 patients), and a failure rate of 16.4% (28 of 170 patients) of those patients who still had their band in place. However, at 10 years, the picture was completely reversed with a band removal rate of 52.2% (47 of 90 patients), a failure rate of 22% (seven of 33 patients) of those who still had their band in place, and a median BMI of 43.43 kg\/m(2). Laparoscopic gastroplasty using the adjustable gastric band appeared to be a promising intervention for super-obese patients when the results at two years were analyzed - fairly simple to perform, with perioperative morbidity and mortality near zero. However, these results do not persist in the long-term for super-obese patients. At ten years, only 11% of patients (nine of 80) have successful bariatric results (%EWL&gt;50%) and we were forced to remove the gastric band in 52.2% of patients (47 of 90) because of complications, regardless of the initial operative technique used. Given these results, AGB gastroplasty is not a recommended method for super-obese patients and we believe that a BMI greater or equal to 50 kg\/m(2) is a contra-indication for this procedure.

All the frozen sections from the department of digestive surgery from Amiens hospital performed between 01\/07\/2006 and 01\/07\/2010 were assessed. Assessment of frozen section forms, reading of pathology reports, and reviewing of frozen section slides were performed. Eight hundred frozen sections were performed in 349 patients. From one to 14 surgical specimens were sent for frozen section (mean 2.3). Frozen sections were performed in 77% of the cases for cancer surgery (n=268), most of the time pancreatic surgery (28.4%) and liver surgery (24.6%). Frozen sections were performed in 69% of the cases for diagnosis, in 29% of the cases to assess surgical margins and in 2% of the cases to assess if tissue specimen was appropriate for pathological diagnosis. Frozen sections were sent all days of the week (except Saturday and Sunday), during all the year, between 8 H 30 and 17 H 15. Thirty-seven percent of the cases were sent between 12 H and 14 H. Response time was 15 minutes (3 to 57 minutes). Rate of differed diagnoses was 2%. Rate of discordant diagnoses was 3.4%. Frozen section is a rapid and accurate tool in digestive surgery.

","1013":"While the prevalence of distal gastric cancer is decreasing in the western world, there has been an alarming rise in the incidence of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA) during recent decades. Current reports show that the prognosis of EGJA remains poor. Therapy strategies are complex due to the anatomical location of the junction between the esophagus and stomach. Surgery, based on Siewert's classification and associated with regional lymphadenectomy, is the mainstay of treatment. Transthoracic esophagectomy is recommended for type I EGJA, while total gastrectomy is recommended for type III EGJA; both approaches can be considered for type II EGJA. Surgery alone can be indicated only for stage I and IIa tumors. Perioperative chemotherapy should be considered for stage IIb, III and non-metastatic stage IV tumors. Adjuvant chemoradiation can be proposed for tumors with high-risk of recurrence in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can be proposed for predominantly esophageal EGJA, and might well become a standard treatment for all EGJA tumors in the near future. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for optimal diagnosis and management.","1014":"","1015":"After hepatectomy for metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC), approximately 50% to 70% of patients develop recurrent hepatic metastases.

An electronic literature search was conducted to identify all medical articles published concerning repeat hepatectomy for liver metastases of colorectal origin during the period January 1990 to December 2010. After a second hepatectomy, the mean mortality was 1.4% and the mean morbidity rate was 21.3%. The 5-year survival ranged from 16% to 55%. After a third or fourth hepatectomy, the mean mortality rate was 0% and the mean morbidity rate was 24.5%. After a third hepatectomy, the 5-year survival ranged from 23.8% to 37.9%.

Indeed, their morbidity is lesser but they are however burdened by a rate of important postoperative fistulas. The purpose of our study is to compare pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis and pancreatico-gastric anastomosis. This work was realized in a bicentric retrospective way. Twenty-five CP were included and classified according to two groups according to the pancreatic anastomosis (group 1 for pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis and group 2 for the pancreatico-gastric anastomosis). CP was realized according to a protocol standardized in both centers and the complications were classified according to the classification of Clavien and Dindo and the fistulas according to the classification of Bassi. Both groups were comparable. The duration operating and the blood losses were equivalent in both groups. There was a significant difference (P=0,014) as regards the rate of fistula. The pancreatico-gastric anastomosis complicated more often of a low-grade fistula. However, in both groups, the treatment was mainly medical. Our results were comparable with those found in the literature and confirmed the advantages of the CP with regard to the cephalic duodeno-pancreatectomy (DPC) or to the distal pancreatectomy (DP). However, in the literature, a meta-analysis did not report difference between both types of anastomosis but this one concerned only the DPC.

Between 1995 and 2011, 595 patients underwent a laparoscopic primary fundoplication (PFP) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). During the same period, 47 patients required a re-operative fundoplication (RFP). In 11 patients, the original wrap had herniated into the thorax. All these revisions consisted of a complete takedown of the original wrap before constructing a tension-free wrap using a standardized technique. Patients with a follow-up of at least 2 years were matched to patients who had been operated only once to assess satisfaction and quality of life. Short term: All patients were operated by laparoscopy with no conversion. There was no mortality. Two postoperative complications necessitating re-operation were observed (morbidity 4.3%): one complete aphagia and one gastric perforation. Long term: 29 re-operated patients with a follow-up of at least 2 years (mean: 4,5 years) (Group RFP) were compared to a matched group of 29 patients operated only once (Group PFP). These groups were comparable in age, sex ratio, BMI and follow-up. In both groups, all patients were operated by laparoscopy without conversion. Morbidity was 3.5% in the RFP group, none in the PFP group. There was no mortality in either group. The length of stay and operative time were significantly higher in the RFP group (4.6 vs. 2.6 days, p&lt;0.05). Two RFP patients (5%) required re-operation at three and seven months vs. none in the PFP group. The long-term satisfaction was comparable in the two groups (78% vs. 85%, p=NS).

For left-sided obstructing cancer, in patients with low surgical risk, primary resection and anastomosis associated with on-table irrigation or manual decompression can be performed. It prevents the confection of a loop colostomy but presents the risk of anastomotic leakage. Subtotal or total colectomy allows the surgeon to encompass distended and fecal-loaded colon, and to perform one-stage resection and anastomosis. Its disadvantage is an increased daily frequency of stools. It must be performed only in cases of diastatic colon perforation or synchronous right colonic cancer. In patients with high surgical risk, Hartmann procedure must be preferred. It allows the treatment of both obstruction and cancer, and prevents anastomotic leakage but needs a second operation to reverse the colostomy.

In multivariate analysis, ileostomy had a lower risk of developing PSH than did colostomy; age mote than 60 years and peristomal complications at the time of stoma creation increased the risk. Only 24% of patients with PSH were free from symptoms related to the hernia.

The inserter helps the deployment of the mesh the same way an umbrella would open, which prevents the enlargement of the wound. Four centres took part in this study. A questionnaire was completed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 1 month of surgery. Data on pain and complications, patients' satisfaction, as well as the ease of installation and the quality of deployment of the mesh was gathered and assessed. From January 2009 to December 2009, 80 patients were assessed. The prosthesis, ease of installation and the deployment quality were rated \"very good\" and \"good\". The average operating room time was 20.86 min (range: 10-50 min). Postoperative pain was rated level 0 and 3 on VAS score in 73 cases (91.25%). After 1 month, no occlusion or relapse were reported on 77 patients; 82.47% of patients had no pain. One seroma required the removal of the mesh. The first set of results on 80 cases is encouraging judging by the simplicity of implantation, low postoperative pain and patient's satisfaction.

Interestingly, due to the enlarged gland size, their high vascularity, and the difficulty to control bleeding, many authors feel that Graves' disease remains a contraindication to current endoscopic techniques. We hypothesize that performing robotic subtotal thyroidectomy in Graves' disease settings could overcome the limitations of conventional endoscopic surgeries in the surgical management of this challenging thyroid disease. Prospective study in an academic hospital. Sixty-seven patients had robotic transaxillary thyroidectomy within a year. Of these, five cases (7%) were done for Graves' disease. There were three females and two males (mean age, 36 years). There were no conversions to laparoscopic or open surgery. The mean (SD) thyroid volume was 16.6 (3.2) ml. The mean (SD) operative time was 159 (17.8)min and docking time was 81 (20)min. Mean blood loss was 18 mL. All patients were discharged home in 24h. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. There was no evidence of postoperative vocal cord palsy or paresis. We showed that robotic transaxillary thyroidectomy is feasible and can be safe and effective in patients with Graves' disease. To our knowledge, this is the first article describing this approach for Graves' disease. These findings, however, warrant additional investigation within future prospective clinical trials.

In case of chronicization, malnutrition and immunologic complications can occur, responsible for a mortality rate of up to 50%. Optimal management of chylothorax can decrease mortality. It is based on three options: conservative treatment, surgery and radiological treatment. Conservative treatment must be initiated at diagnosis and results in resolution of the chylothorax is achieved in 50 to 70% of cases.

No formal agreement has been reached about the routine practice of intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). The purpose of this survey was to describe the practices and the opinions of surgeons in western France. A survey was conducted among 300 visceral surgeons practicing in western France who were asked to respond to a questionnaire with objective and subjective items. One hundred forty-eight answers were interpretable. Among these 148 surgeons, 125 (83.4%) performed IOC routinely (IOCr group) and 23 (15.4%) selectively (IOCs group). Mean age of responding surgeons was 49.3 years. Groups IOCr and IOCs were not significantly different concerning surgical experience. Surgeons in both groups responded that IOC effectively screens for intraoperative bile duct injury. In our survey, routine practice of IOC was more common than reported by our English-speaking colleagues. The routine users responded that IOC can screen for intraoperative bile duct injury or choledocholithiasis. The selective users responded that IOC has its own morbidity. IOC is commonly performed in France during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Although it may not be indispensable, it allows rapid screening for intraoperative bile duct injury. It also provides documented proof of good surgical practice in the event of a litigation claim after bile duct injury.","1046":"The hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The current management is based on the control of pelvic bleeding by combining pelvic ring stabilization and embolization of pelvic arteries. The mortality of these patients, however, exceeds 30%. Recently the preperitoneal packing, based on the hemostatic tamponade of the pelvic cavity has been described. The objective of this study was to evaluate the interest of this new surgical procedure. The effectiveness of the standard algorithm is evaluated by analysis of pelvic injuries in 200 severe trauma treated at the Sainte-Anne Hospital. The results are then compared with literature data on the preperitoneal packing. The profile injury, management and morbidity and mortality was evaluated in 200 polytrauma. After an initial phase of resuscitation, unstable pelvic fractures were treated with a circumferential belt followed by the application of an external fixator. Arteriography was performed for all patients with persistent hemodynamic instability. The mean injury severity score (ISS) was 31 (4-75). The mean trauma-related injury severity score (TRISS) was 74% (3-99). The proportion of hemodynamically unstable patients was 47%. Fifteen patients (41%) had severe bleeding. The median number of blood transfusion was 10 (4-42); eight patients (22%) underwent embolization. For two patients, reducing the pelvic fracture with an external fixator resulted in permanent hemostasis. Two patients underwent a laparotomy first, for the control of a hemoperitoneum. The mortality rate of the group of patients with hemorrhage was 33% (5\/15). This high mortality leads to reconsider the place of pelvic embolization as firstline treatment. Some major drawbacks are noted: its effectiveness in treating venous bleeding, availability and duration of the procedure. The preperitoneal packing is a fast and effective surgical alternative. It seems to improve hemodynamic status of patients and significantly reduce the use of embolization and massive transfusion. Embolization is still indicated for patients not responding to surgery. However survival is not significantly improved. ","1047":"Infection after repair of groin hernia is rare, even since the advent of mesh repair. The debate remains open about antibiotic prophylaxis. Assess incidence of this kind of complication, determine criteria of diagnosis and strategy of therapy by examining the collective experience of 32 surgeons. Fifty surgeons were asked to report their experience with mesh repair of inguinal hernias and specifically mesh infection. Diagnosis and therapy for each mesh infection were detailed. Forty-five cases were reported in 38 patients who had undergone open or laparoscopic mesh repair. Diagnosis was straightforward and established at a variable delay after mesh insertion: 51% during the first postoperative month; 26% more than one year after the procedure. Infection cured in 33 patients after mesh removal, in one step in 14 cases, but after many attempts for conservative therapy in 19 cases; the mean delay to cure was 12.5 months. Visceral resections had to be associated with mesh removal in 13% of cases. This is the largest series of mesh infections after inguinal hernia repair reported in the literature. According to the evidence provided here, mesh removal appears to be the most appropriate treatment of this rare and serious complication. ","1048":"Functional disorders such as delayed gastric emptying, dumping syndrome or duodeno-gastro-esophageal reflux occur in half of the patients who undergo esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction for cancer. The potential role for pyloroplasty in the prevention of functional disorders is still debated. Antireflux fundoplication during esophagectomy can apparently reduce the reflux but at the cost of increasing the complexity of the operation; it is not widely used. The treatment of functional disorders arising after esophagectomy and gastroplasty for cancer is based mainly on dietary measures. Proton pump inhibitors have well documented efficiency and should be given routinely to prevent reflux complications. Erythromycin may prevent delayed gastric emptying, but it should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders. In the event of anastomotic stricture, endoscopic dilatation is usually efficient.

The sympathetic-associated PHEO and PGL are usually functioning and most often arise in the abdomen. Because they harbor very specific characteristics (hypersecretion of catecholamines, familial origin in up to 30% of them, multiple locations, etc.) their perioperative management needs to be known by surgeons taking care of these patients in order to avoid operative disasters. Surgery can lead to perioperative hemodynamic modifications and sometimes catecholamine storm even in normotensive patients with PHEO and PGL.

This retrospective study looked at the incidence of CDL during cholecystectomy, as well as the context of its occurrence; recommendations for a practical surgical approach are offered. Over a period of 30 months, 143 consecutive cholecystectomies (103 women, 40 men; mean age: 57 years) were performed by the same surgeon: 142 by laparoscopy, and one by laparotomy due to a history of previous gastrectomy. The cystic duct was always opened and milked upward in search of CDL before immediate clip occlusion or performance of cholangiography (106 times, 74.1%). In seven cases, cholangiography was impossible because the cystic duct was too narrow. There was no mortality. CDL was found in 21 cases (14.7%) and removed. This had not been identified by preoperative imaging (ultrasound or CT). Pain in the month preceding cholecystectomy occurred more frequently in cases of CDL (19\/21[90.4%] vs 36\/122 [29.5%]; P&lt;0.001). Similarly, liver function tests were more often abnormal with CDL (10\/21 [47.6%] vs 30\/122 [24.5%]; P&lt;0.05). However, neither jaundice nor gallbladder inflammation was predictive of CDL in this study. Echoendoscopy (EUS) was performed more often for suspected common duct lithiasis migration (CBDL) in patients with CDL than for those without (9\/21 [42.8%] vs 26\/122 [21.3%]; P&lt;0.05).

There were 14 men and eight women. Cholangitis was present in 59% of patients and isolated pain in the right upper quadrant was found in 20% of patients. Procedures performed included internal fistula drainage through the sphincter of Oddi (37.3%), cystobiliary disconnection by percutaneous transhepatic cystocholedochostomy (27.3%), bipolar drainage (27.3%), direct suture closure of the fistula (9.1%). The postoperative course was uneventful in 15 patients. Specific morbidity concerned four patients.

Most studies have included different tumoral locations (esophagus and stomach) and different histological types (adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma), making it difficult to interpret results. Surgery is currently the standard treatment for small tumors. Surgery should be preceded by neo-adjuvant treatment for patients with locally advanced resectable tumors, either preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation therapy.

Two groups were compared: one with patients having undergone LSG after first-line gastric banding (n = 31) and the second, with patients having undergone first-line LSG (n = 71). Endpoints were overall morbidity and intra\/postoperative complications including gastric leaks consecutive to staple line disruption as well as other septic or hemorrhagic complications. Multivariable analysis was performed to detect independent risk factors for morbidity. Overall morbidity was significantly higher in patients having undergone LSG after first-line gastric banding compared with those undergoing first-line LSG (32.2% vs. 7%, P = 0.002). Gastric leaks secondary to staple line disruption also occurred statistically significantly more often in patients with first-line gastric banding (16.1% vs. 2.8%, P = 0.043). Waiting 6 months between gastric band removal and performing LSG did not prevent the increased morbidity compared with first-line LSG. Multivariable analysis revealed that among the factors analyzed (age, gender, comorbidity, body mass index, surgeon, first-line gastric banding), the only independent risk factor for staple line disruption was first-line gastric banding with an odds ratio = 6.6 (95% confidence interval = [1.2-36.3]). Undergoing first-line gastric banding increases the risk of complications after secondary LSG.

The records of 72 patients with acute uncomplicated sigmoid volvulus with obstruction who were treated by tube sigmoidostomy (Group I: n=32) and sigmoidopexy (Group II: n=40) were reviewed retrospectively. Follow-up period was 22 months (range: 6-51 months). Results show significant improvement in postoperative tachycardia, respiratory distress and urine output in Group I patients as compared to those in Group II. Most of the clinical parameters of Group I patients normalized by day 3, while it took up to 7 days in Group II patients. Intraabdominal hypertension caused by persistent colonic dilatation after sigmoidopexy was found to be an important determinant of postoperative morbidity. As compared to tube sigmoidostomy, the sigmoidopexy group had delayed recovery, more chances of abdominal fascial dehiscence, and longer hospital stay, as well as more prolonged abdominal discomfort, constipation, and recurrent volvulus rates during follow-up. Tube sigmoidostomy provides both fixation and decompression of the redundant sigmoid colon in the postoperative period while allowing time to recover from massive dilatation and edema caused by prolonged volvulus. Compared with sigmoidopexy for the treatment of uncomplicated sigmoid volvulus, tube sigmoidostomy leads to lesser rates of morbidity and recurrence.

By changing to the Anglo-American (\"one day surgery\", i.e. hospital stay less than 24 hours) or hybrid system (less than 12 hours+1 day surgery), ambulatory surgery could easily be offered to patients excluded by the current system (ambulatory department open less than 12 hours).

For incidentally-discovered cancers, survival was 28% at five years. Prognostic factors include age, TNM stage, gallbladder perforation during cholecystectomy and less-than-optimal resection at re-operation. Whether the laparoscopic route for the initial cholecystectomy has an impact on survival remains a subject of debate. R0 surgery is the only potentially curative treatment: simple cholecystectomy with clear margins is adequate resection for stage T1a tumors; extended cholecystectomy with lymphadenectomy and possibly resection of the bile duct is required for more advanced stages. After curative resection, neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not, so far, proven effective.

In this study, we describe and discuss the indications and feasibility of various techniques of vascular ligation. Uterine mattress suture compression techniques and abdomino-pelvic packing are also described. When conservative management is feasible, the first line approach should be bilateral distal ligation of the uterine arteries: this simple and low-risk technique is immediately effective in 80% of cases. If bleeding persists, uterine devascularization can be completed by a triple ligation as described by Tsirulnikov, with or without supplemental proximal ligation of the uterine arteries. This procedure should be performed in preference to the so-called \"stepwise ligation sequence\", which involves ligation of the ovarian pedicles and poses a risk of subsequent ovarian failure. Bilateral hypogastric artery ligation is also an effective and widely used first-line technique for experienced surgeons.

The time necessary to perform an intracorporeal knot improved significantly by 56% after four sessions. Overall, 89% of students progressed and mastered the basic skills. Asked about their formation, 74% of the students thought their training in laparoscopy was insufficient. The pelvic-trainer is an accessible and reliable tool for training of young residents in laparoscopy. Use of the pelvic-trainer must be promoted among young residents during their training.

Clinical and hemodynamic changes, and CT imaging guide the conservative attitude or pose an indication for urgent surgical intervention in unstable patients. The adoption of CM for blunt liver trauma has resulted in an increased incidence of late complications. These consist principally of persistent hemorrhage, fistulas and bile leaks, the abdominal compartment syndrome, and hepatic necrosis or abscess. These late complications can be managed secondarily by planned interventions via laparotomy or laparoscopy, interventional radiology and\/or endoscopic techniques in a non-emergency setting as indicated by circumstances and with the benefit of multidisciplinary consultation. These secondary interventions should not be considered a failure of conservative treatment, but rather as an anticipated eventuality in the management of these patients.","1113":"","1114":"In head and neck surgery, minimally invasive approaches have been typically avoided due to concerns about visualization, possible damage to vital structures, and limited availability of effective instrumentation. The incorporation of robotic technology in surgery is now an accepted fact, and because of the complexities of certain laparoscopic procedures, the extended capabilities offered by robotic technology have gained wide acceptance. We report the case of a patient who underwent a robotic total thyroidectomy using a gasless right transaxillary approach. This technique provides a high quality image leading to improved visualization of vital structures during thyroidectomy with the added advantage of avoidance of a neck incision. Several issues regarding this technique remain to be clarified and evaluated in multicenter studies: patient selection, surgeon training and learning curve, postoperative morbidity due to recurrent nerve and parathyroid injury, long term oncologic and cosmetic results. However, we believe that robotic thyroid surgery using a gasless transaxillary approach will advance the frontiers of minimally invasive endocrine surgery.","1115":"","1116":"","1117":null,"1118":"Transferring results of research into clinical practice and their effective use for decisions in health care have become a major concern and are pivotal to quality improvement.

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of ambulatory hernia repair in a consecutive series of unselected patients. From June 2008 to October 2009, 257 patients (238 men and 19 women, median age 65 years) were treated in a same-day surgery unit for 270 hernias (244 groin hernias, 25 ventral hernias and one Spiegelian hernia). For groin hernia, the techniques included the totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP) in 108 cases, the transinguinal preperitoneal (TIPP) approach in 106 cases and other alternative techniques in 30 cases; for ventral hernias, the technique was an open suture in 20 cases, an open prosthetic repair in four cases and laparoscopic repair in one case. Anesthesia was general in 145 cases, local in 121 cases and spinal in four cases. Repair was completed in a same-day surgery setting in 242 (89.6%) cases; hospital stay greater than 23 hours was planned for 21 (7.8%) patients while non-programmed hospitalizations were necessary for seven (2.6%) patients. There were two (0.7%) readmissions and nine (3.3%) benign postoperative complications. These results suggest that groin and ventral hernia repair can be performed in an outpatient setting in nearly 90% of unselected patients. ","1131":"Several reconstruction techniques are possible after gastrectomy. The best reconstruction is one, that maintains satisfactory nutritional status and quality of life while keeping postoperative morbidity as low as possible. The aim of this study was to describe the different reconstruction techniques that can be proposed after distal and total gastrectomy, heeding to the French guidelines on the use of mechanical sutures in these indications. We then conducted a review of randomized trials dealing with reconstruction techniques after distal and total gastrectomy. After distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y reconstruction seems superior to Billroth I and Billroth II reconstructions in terms of functional outcomes and long-term endoscopic results and should be chosen in patients with benign disease or superficial tumors. Otherwise, Billroth II should be preferred over Billroth I reconstruction because of lower postoperative morbidity and better oncologic margins. After total gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y reconstruction remains the easiest solution, with satisfactory functional results. Addition of a pouch reservoir after Roux-en-Y reconstruction seems to improve short-term functional outcome after total gastrectomy with better potential for nutritional intake. In the long-term, quality of life seems better mainly in patients with small-resected tumors associated with a good prognosis.","1132":"","1133":"Hepatico-portal fistula (HPF) is a rare condition, most often of post-traumatic or iatrogenic origin and occasionally secondary to a ruptured aneurysm of the hepatic artery into the portal vein. HPF in extrahepatic locations often results in portal hypertension (PHT). While Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography are usually demonstrative, arteriography remains indispensable to clarify the exact anatomical configuration. In the treatment of these arteriovenous (AV) fistulas, open surgical approaches have increasingly given way to radiological embolization techniques, especially in intrahepatic locations, but surgery remains indicated for AV fistulas of the hepatic pedicle where maintenance of hepatic arterial flow is a priority of treatment. We report a patient who had an AV fistula of the hepatic pedicle with resultant PHT presenting 5 years after open abdominal trauma. Treatment was surgical; the immediate and long-term postoperative course was uneventful with regression of PHT. Through analysis of this case and a review of the literature, we discuss the clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic, and prognostic features of this lesion.","1134":"","1135":"","1136":null,"1137":"Gallstones are commonly observed after rapid weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgery.

We conducted an inventory of splenic injury treatment modalities of splenic injury in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. A questionnaire was sent by e-mail to 33 surgeons practicing in 10 hospitals in that region. Surgeons were asked: how many cases were treated per year (PMSI databank for the last three years), local resources (resuscitation bay or intensive care unit, availability of CT and interventional radiology), indications (surgery, embolization, nonoperative management [NOM]), prognostic criteria, NOM modalities (duration of bed rest, hospital stay, restriction of physical activity, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and imaging schedule). Thirty-one surgeons replied. An average of 185 patients were treated per year. There was consensus concerning the indication for urgent splenectomy, NOM was practiced in the stable patient (even with diffuse hemoperitoneum) and splenic artery embolization was performed for active bleeding (blush on CT) (for the six centers who have interventional radiology at their disposal). Disparities existed between centers concerning the modalities of NOM excepting imaging monitoring, initial surveillance in resuscitation bay or intensive care and in the therapeutic indications when bleeding persisted. Based on the consensus observed in this study and an analysis of the literature, a uniform treatment policy can be proposed. ","1141":"Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT1) is a common endocrine disorder, which is asymptomatic in 80% of cases. The diagnosis is ordinarily easily made, based on an inappropriately elevated parathormone level (PTH) in the face of hypercalcemia. In 85% of cases, HPT1 is due to hormone secretion from a single parathyroid gland (uniglandular disease) and the remaining patients have multiglandular disease. The best localization study is MIBI scintigraphy (methoxy isobutyl isonitrile) coupled with the results of a neck ultrasound exam (sensitivity &gt;95%). Other investigations are reserved for patients with persistent or recurrent HPT1 post-surgery. Surgery is the only cure. The surgical approach may include a bilateral cervical exploration, a unilateral approach under local anesthesia, or focused minimally invasive (video-assisted or totally endoscopic) approaches. A decrease in PTH level measured intraoperatively of greater than 50% is predictive of cure in more than 97% of cases. Surgery is recommended even for moderate HPT1 and for very elderly patients because improvement in both the quality of life and bone density have been proven in these situations. The role of medical treatment is limited. Persistent or recurrent HPT1 requires a meticulous diagnostic approach and management in surgical centers with expertise. Persistent elevation of PTH postoperatively without hypercalcemia does not mandate further exploration. The prognosis of normocalcemic patients with elevated postoperative PTH levels remains uncertain.","1142":"","1143":"Replacement of the esophagus by colon interposition often has late complications, frequently due to technical defects. We report the case of a patient who presented 12 years after surgery with complex dysfunctions of a colonic interposition, including cervical and retrosternal strictures associated with a redundant portion of the colon graft. The interest of this case lies in its combination of many late complications of this surgery in a single person together with the simplicity of the treatment.","1144":"","1145":"The incidence of esophageal perforation (EP) has risen with the increasing use of endoscopic procedures, which are currently the most frequent causes of EP. Despite decades of clinical experience, innovations in surgical technique and advances in intensive care management, EP still represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. EP is a devastating event and mortality hovers close to 20%. Ambiguous presentations leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment and the difficulties in management are responsible for the high morbidity and mortality rates. A high variety of treatment options are available ranging from observational medical therapy to radical esophagectomy. The potential role of interventional endoscopy and the use of stents for the treatment of EP seem interesting but remain to be evaluated. Surgical primary repair, with or without reinforcement, is the preferred approach in patients with EP. Prognosis is mainly determined by the cause, the location of the injury and the delay between perforation and initiation of therapy.","1146":"Coloproctectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis (CP-IAA) has been in use for 30 years. This intervention is the standard technique when surgery is indicated for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and for ulcerative colitis (UC). Although the surgery is safe with mortality of less than 1%, it is associated with a morbidity of 18-70%. We thought a literature review about long-term complications would be enlightening. Pouchitis is the most common complication; it occurs in 70% of patients over 20 years follow-up; small bowel obstruction affects 25% of patients and pelvic sepsis occurs in 20-30% within 10 years. CP-IAA can impact the patient's sexual life due to erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction, dyspareunia, and incontinence of stool during sexual intercourse. Nevertheless, patients with long-standing UC describe an overall improvement in their sexual function after surgery. The failure rate varies from 3.5 to 15%; major causes of failure are sepsis, unrecognized Crohn's disease, and poor functional results. Cases of dysplasia and cancer have been reported in the reservoir, but more particularly when there is retained colonic glandular mucosa. The transitional zone should be monitored whenever there are risk factors for colon neoplasia. The relatively high morbidity of CP-IAA should not overshadow the good functional results of this technique.","1147":"Physicians in France have been asked to change their day-to-day medical practice to reduce overall costs. We examine ways to achieve this goal in thyroid surgery. We defined and implemented a clinical pathway to optimize the economic viability of thyroid surgery by increasing revenues and lowering expenses. An increase in revenue was achieved by decreasing patient length of stay (LOS) through the use of a fast-track rehabilitation protocol. Expenses were decreased by performing all pre-operative work-up in the out-patient setting and by decreasing costs in the operating room. For 292 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy, the average LOS has been decreased over time to a mean of 2.03 days in 2008; 96% of patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. These results were primarily achieved by using a fast-track rehabilitation clinical pathway, and no increase in postoperative morbidity was noted. Operating time was decreased by 20% through the use of a second surgical assistant and hemostatic scissors but this improvement did not translate into better daily utilization of the operating room. The economic profitability of thyroid surgery is improved when mean LOS is reduced to 2 days through a fast-track protocol. Decreasing the duration of hospitalization was more effective than decreasing operative duration in controlling overall costs. ","1148":"Fistula arising from the glands of the anal crypts is the most common form of anoperineal sepsis. It is characterized by a primary internal orifice in the anal canal, a fistulous tract, and an abscess and\/or secondary perineal orifice with purulent discharge. Antibiotics are not curative. The treatment of an abscess is urgent and consists, whenever possible, of incision and drainage under local anesthesia. Definitive treatment of the fistulous tract can await a second stage. The primary aim is to control infection without sacrificing anal continence. Fistulotomy is the basis for all treatments but the specific technique depends on the height of the fistula in relation to the sphincteric mechanism. Overall results of fistulotomy are excellent but there is some risk of anal incontinence. This explains the growing interest in sphincter sparing techniques such as the mucosal advancement flap, the injection of fibrin glue, and the plug procedure. However, results of these procedures are not yet good enough and leave much room for improvement.","1149":"","1150":"","1151":"With an incidence of 950,000 pregnancies per year in France, the likelihood of seeing one or more surgical abdominal diseases during pregnancy is high.

We studied the clinical data of patients who underwent hepatic resection for intrahepatic lithiasis from January 1992 to December 2008 and assessed the immediate and long-term results of these interventions. Of 49 treated patients, 47 underwent liver resection. In the majority of cases, the disease was limited to the left lobe and left hepatectomy was the most commonly performed surgical procedure. The operative mortality was zero with morbidity in 24.5% of patients. Cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed in six cases (12.2%). In 91.6% of cases the long-term results were good or satisfactory.

The postoperative course was uncomplicated. Functional and aesthetic results were satisfactory. There was no tumor recurrence or postoperative incisional hernia. Many reconstructive options have been proposed, but the anterolateral thigh free flap offers the advantage of an integral reconstruction of the abdominal wall without resultant donor site morbidity and with a satisfactory cosmetic result. In our hands, this flap is the ideal choice for reconstruction of the abdominal wall after loss of substance.","1158":"Desmoid tumor is a rare, benign fibroblastic tumor that is characterized by highly aggressive local invasiveness.

This study aimed to assess the reliability and the reproducibility of this score for patients presenting in the emergency room with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. A prospective monocenter study included all adults who presented in the emergency room with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The score was calculated by assessing six symptoms and two laboratory values weighted by coefficients. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was confirmed by the histological examination of the resected appendix. Three groups of patients with high, low, and intermediate scores were defined as described in the literature. Of the 233 patients studied, 174 underwent surgery: three had a normal appendix on histological exam. The statistical analysis of the results showed that a score lower than 4 was significantly associated with the absence of acute appendicitis while a score higher than 6 was significantly associated with acute appendicitis which required surgical care. But a score between 4 and 6 was not discriminant. The Alvarado score is a reliable, cheap and reproducible tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the emergency room; if the score is higher than 6 or lower than 4, there is no need for complementary exams. Patients with a score between 4 and 6, require serial reassessment of physical findings and score over 24 hours and\/or complementary diagnostic exam such as ultrasound or CT scan.

Complete pathologic and radiological response rates are approximately 4 and 7%, respectively. Hepatotoxic effects of oxaliplatin and irinotecan on the non-tumoral liver parenchyma have been reported and are incriminated in vascular changes (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome [SOS]) and chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH). Oxaliplatin-based regimens are associated with an increased risk of vascular lesions and irinotecan-based regimens are associated with increased risks of steatosis and steatohepatitis. SOS increases morbidity after major liver resection, mostly after administration of more than six cycles of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. CASH increases morbidity and mortality rates after hepatectomy. Preliminary results have shown that the addition of targeted molecular therapy (bevacizumab or cetuximab) to conventional chemotherapy does not increase the postoperative morbidity or mortality rates after hepatectomy and does not create additional injury to the non-tumoral liver parenchyma. However, bevacizumab may impair regeneration of the future remnant. Chemotherapy may reduce the sensitivity of CT scan and PET scan in the detection of metastases.","1163":"Erythromycin (ER) is an antibiotic with prokinetic activity. This property has led to its clinical use to improve gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis. Several papers have reported the effectiveness of ER in such patients; however few of these studies have been well-conducted methodologically with evaluation of clinical endpoints and their results are often contradictory. A benefit\/risk analysis prior to prescription of ER should take into account the numerous medication interactions of this drug as well as the prevention of cardiovascular complications, most notably torsade de pointes and cardiac arrest. The aim of this paper was to provide new insights into these adverse events and allow for better-informed prescription. Risk prevention requires prescription guidelines and effective communication among surgeons, anesthesiologists and pharmacists.","1164":"Vascular injury due to penetrating abdominal trauma is a major challenge for trauma teams. Arterial and venous injuries occur with equal frequency. Treatment depends on the hemodynamic status of the patient: under stable conditions, angiography can be envisioned, whereas instability is an indication for immediate surgery; damage control is the most frequent procedure. As persisting on complete surgical exploration may lead to fatal outcome, the surgeon must be prepared to perform perihepatic or pelvic packing and employ endovascular techniques as appropriate. However, the surgeon has to be prepared to deal with uncontrolled hemorrhage, and explore all central retroperitoneal hematomas, retroperitoneal hematoma located in the flanks except when stable in the hemodynamically unstable patient, and those in the pelvis only if the patient is stable. Since it is more critical to control hemorrhage than to avoid end-organ ischemia, vascular ligation is more commonly used than other techniques. However, survival is very low in these severely wounded patients.","1165":"","1166":"The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has led several countries to standardize and update its management. This review aims at summarizing these evolutions through six questions focusing on diagnosis and treatment. The radiological diagnosis of this tumor has been refined. Besides being hypervascular at the arterial phase, the \"washout\" in particular at the late phase of injection has become a prominent feature. Although routine ultrasound remains the corner stone of screening, contrast ultrasound has become a very reliable characterization tool as it allows continuous monitoring of the vascular kinetics. Biopsy of the tumor allows identification of conventional or molecular prognosis features, some of which could be used in current practice. The metabolic syndrome is an increasing etiology of HCC and carcinogenesis in this context may not always require the development of formal underlying cirrhosis. Associated (in particular cardiovascular) conditions account for an increased morbidity-mortality following surgery. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment of early-stage tumors. The limited availability of grafts has led some countries including France to implement new allocation rules that are still evaluated and might need to be refined. Sorafenib is the first medical treatment shown to be effective in the treatment of HCC. This efficacy is however still limited and its indication is therefore restricted to Child-Pugh A, OMS 0-2 patients in whom a potentially curative treatment is contraindicated.","1167":"We report the case of an asymptomatic 56-year-old woman with a metastatic pancreatic endocrine tumor, fortuitously discovered by abdominal imaging.

Surgical resection was performed in two stages. The first procedure was an extended left pancreatectomy with venous thrombectomy and \"clearance\" of the left hepatic lobe. During the interval, embolization of the right portal vein was carried out. Right hepatectomy and radiofrequency destruction of residual metastases was then performed.

Investigation and comparison of clinical data of thyroid cancer patients from 1996 to 2006 from the Department of Head and Neck Surgery in the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. The number of patients with thyroid cancer rose from 148 in the year 1996 to 572 in the year 2006, a 3.9-fold increase. Routine ultrasound survey during physical examination revealed four cases (2.7%) in 1996 and 285 cases (49.8%) in 2006. The sensitivity of the ultrasound survey in thyroid cancer diagnosis was 86.66% in 1996 and 88.20% in 2006 (P&gt;0.05). Papillary carcinoma was most prevalent (87.8% in 1996 and 92.8% in 2006). An increasing proportion of small tumors was found. The incidence of microcarcinoma was 35.7% in 2006 in contrast with 20.3% in 1996 (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, tumors with diameter from 1 to 2 cm were found in 38.5% patients in 2006 as opposed to 27.0% in 1996 (P&lt;0.01). Extrathyroid extension was reported in 46 (31.1%) patients in 1996, but only in 39 (6.8%) in 2006 (P&lt;0.01). Central cervical lymph node metastases were found in 98 (66.2%) patients in 1996, contrasting with 301 (52.6%) in 2006 (P&lt;0.05). Thirty-seven (25.0%) patients had lateral cervical lymph node metastasis in 1996 compared with 117 (20.5%) in 2006 (P&gt;0.05). Last, the proportion of stage I cancers in 2006 was higher than that in 1996. With the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer, cancer was discovered at an earlier stage. This is due to new clinical features of thyroid cancer, such as the decrease in tumor diameter, the lower rate of extrathyroid extension and of cervical lymph node metastasis. Routine ultrasound survey during physical examination has become the most common way to detect thyroid cancer. Increasing usage of diagnostic scrutiny, including the ultrasound survey, has most likely contributed to the increased incidence through detection of small thyroid cancers. Increased use of ultrasound to screen thyroid cancer in early stages should lead to better therapeutic outcome.
