For a large class of shape regular but possibly non-uniform meshes including algebraically graded meshes, we prove that the inverse of the stiffness matrix can be approximated in the H -matrix format at an exponential rate in the block rank. Since the storage complexity of the hierarchical matrix is logarithmic-linear and only grows linearly in the block-rank, we obtain an efficient approximation that can be used, e.g., as an approximate direct solver or preconditioner for iterative solvers.","3":"We develop a geometrically intrinsic formulation of the arbitrary-order Virtual Element Method (VEM) on polygonal cells for the numerical solution of elliptic surface partial differential equations (PDEs). The PDE is first written in covariant form using an appropriate local reference system. The knowledge of the local parametrization allows us to consider the two-dimensional VEM scheme, without any explicit approximation of the surface geometry. The theoretical properties of the classical VEM are extended to our framework by taking into consideration the highly anisotropic character of the final discretization. These properties are extensively tested on triangular and polygonal meshes using a manufactured solution. The limitations of the scheme are verified as functions of the regularity of the surface and its approximation.","4":"A finite element cochain complex on Cartesian meshes of any dimension based on the H 1  -inner product is introduced. It yields H 1  -conforming finite element spaces with exterior derivatives in H 1  . We use a tensor product construction to obtain L 2  -stable projectors into these spaces which commute with the exterior derivative. The finite element complex is generalized to a family of arbitrary order."},"articletitle":{"0":null,"1":"All-at-once multigrid approaches for one-dimensional space-fractional diffusion equations.","2":"Approximating inverse FEM matrices on non-uniform meshes with H -matrices.","3":"Arbitrary-order intrinsic virtual element method for elliptic equations on surfaces.","4":"H 1  -conforming finite element cochain complexes and commuting quasi-interpolation operators on Cartesian meshes."},"doi":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":""},"journal_title":{"0":"Calcolo","1":"Calcolo","2":"Calcolo","3":"Calcolo","4":"Calcolo"},"keyword":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":"\n\nH\n-matricesApproximabilityFEMNon-uniform meshes","3":"Geometrically intrinsic operatorsPolygonal meshSurface PDEsVirtual element methodhigh-order methods","4":"Commuting diagram propertyFinite element exterior calculusQuasi-interpolationTensor productde Rham complex"},"language":{"0":"eng","1":"eng","2":"eng","3":"eng","4":"eng"},"pmid":{"0":34898682,"1":34803177,"2":34803176,"3":34803175,"4":34803174},"pubdate_year":{"0":2022,"1":2021,"2":2021,"3":2021,"4":2021}}
