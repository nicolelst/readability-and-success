Diamond was a psychiatrist, antiquarian, and photographer, who was the first person to take photographs of female asylum patients. These photographs, using the newly invented technology of the camera, were intended to be objective and accurate visual indicators of mental illness. Considering Diamond's overlapping interests, his project must be understood within the larger cultural and historical context and the tensions inherent in medical photography and portraiture. Despite the goal of capturing \"objective, scientific data,\" the photographs instead relied on traditional iconography dating back to the Greeks and Middle Ages and can be analyzed from an art historical perspective. As an antiquarian, Diamond collected portraits of his patients just as he collected various other objects. As such, while Diamond may be considered a humanistic leader of the moral treatment movement, his work in capturing these \"specimens,\" the female patients, reflects a perpetuation of the stigmatization of mental illness to be put on display for the Victorian audience.","1":null,"2":"The criminal practices of National Socialism not only led to millions of murders, but also to increased suicide rates. The present study examines a specific aspect of this phenomenon: the suicides and corresponding motives of 275 German doctors and dentists in the period from 1933 to 1949. The analysis is based on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources. Most suicides were due to National Socialist repression, with peaks in 1938 and 1942. One fifth of the cases were among National Socialist perpetrators, with a peak of those suicides occurring in 1945. The motives for suicide ranged from despair to a lack of career prospects to a final act of self-determination and political opposition; many of the doctors experienced or expected a social downfall before attempting suicide.","3":"","4":"In 1918, German archaeologist Robert Koldewey, excavator of Babylon, Iraq, observed that the depiction of the fantastical \"dragon of Babylon\" on the sixth century BCE Ishtar Gate must reference a real animal whose closest relatives would be dinosaurs like the iguanodon. Though ignored within archaeology, Koldewey's comments were taken up in German-American popular science writer Willy Ley's \"romantic zoology\" (1941), then by Bernard Heuvelmans (1955), founding figure in the fringe field of cryptozoology. Their interpretations would ultimately inspire expeditions by the International Society of Cryptozoologists in Central Africa to find the Mokele-Mbembe, a \"living dinosaur,\" and migrate into Young Earth Creationist and ancient aliens theories. An analysis of Koldewey's marginal academic observation serves as a means of considering the process of knowledge formation and canonization and the unpredictable life of scholarly ideas.","5":"Standing apart from Martin Heidegger's 1929-1930 metaphysical lessons is his description of a photograph taken by Josef Maria Eder, for Sigmund Exner, using the lens of a glow worm's eye. Since the technical details of the production of such a photography are not readily available, I will reconstruct the experimental setting. Paying attention to the technical details opens up a venue for historical and philosophical reflection based on the creative potential of scientific practices. Through a critical approach, a rather generic experimental meshwork could be turned into a natural-artifactual, living-nonliving hybrid setting in which the concepts of dense technological environment, philosophical toy, and experimental system meet and intertwine thanks to the playfulness that goes through them, a quality rooted in scientific practices. Within this hybrid and playful configuration, the unliving emerges as a paradoxical voice for the living.","6":"In this article we document the role of Ivan Matveevich Sokolov, anatomy professor at Moscow University, in the mummification of Julia Pastrana, born in Mexico (afterwards an American citizen by marriage), and her son. Sokolov had investigated and described the corpse of this famous \"hairy woman\" as an example of a congenital anomaly of the genus Homo. Due to the art of Sokolov's embalming, the mummies of Julia and her son were presented to the scientific world, which made it possible to study similar cases of deformity in the human population. However, the historical role of Sokolov was not limited to his study of a congenital disease. His thorough postmortem examination and description of Pastrana's and her son's bodies allowed Sokolov to make an indirect contribution to evolutionary thought. Sokolov's confirmation that Pastrana belonged to the genus Homo refuted all speculation about her hybrid origins and status as a missing link in the evolution of apes into humans.","7":"Animals, especially mammals, have played a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 virus originated in animals, and the virus can jump back and forth between humans and animals. Moreover, animals have been central to the development of the various vaccines against the virus now employed around the world, continuing a long history. The interrelationships between animals and humans in both disease transmission and its prevention call for an interdisciplinary approach to medicine.","8":"Like the rest of Scandinavia, Denmark and Norway have a strong tradition of comprehensive topographical descriptions, often written by local clergymen. Physical-economic descriptions of small areas, most often parishes, emerging in the middle of the eighteenth century soon formed a model that remained strikingly uniform until around 1820, when the topographies changed once again. In the Dual Monarchy of Denmark and Norway, the years between 1760 and 1820 revealed a prolific topographic genre in which natural history and natural resources played important parts. Natural history was essential, being regarded as the condition for the composite peasant economy and offering the opportunity to reveal unknown sources of livelihood or intensify the use of those sources. Natural history was not only an aspect of the locality that should be dealt with in the description of the locality, but it became an entire scheme or method for the whole description, in which knowledge took up the form of inventories as did natural history itself. The topographical descriptions give hints as to the sort of observing, collecting, identifying, sorting, and ordering practices that lay behind the text. The concise and neutral form of these topographies did not give much room for the emotionality otherwise considered in the period as both a precondition for and an effect of dealings with natural history, and only rarely, in small gaps, did the sensual and aesthetic preferences of the authors come through, occasionally revealing their doubts but also their love of nature.","9":"This article explores how the Chinese state organized scientific research in the 1950s, through a case study of mathematics. By examining the organizing process of the Chinese Mathematical Society and the establishment of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the article explains how a number of state agents were selected to lead national level research institutes as a means for guiding scientists in serving the needs of the state. In addition, under state corporatism, all scientists were attached to discipline-specific academic societies, forming a large hierarchy consisting of societies at different levels. When the political leaders needed to transform the agendas of the scientists, these organizations served as channels for communicating to constituent members what to do. Given this kind of organizational structure in the early days of the People's Republic of China, it was hard to differentiate between scientists and the organizational apparatus, especially for the scientists holding top-level leadership positions. Nevertheless, this study shows that individual researchers often resisted official mandates and found ways to pursue independent research interests by employing the state's rhetoric.","10":null,"11":"One common contemporary usage of the term \"diagnostic uncertainty\" is to refer to cases for which a diagnosis is not, or cannot, be applied to the presenting case. This is a paradoxical usage, as the absence of diagnosis is often as close to a certainty as can be a human judgement. What makes this sociologically interesting is that it represents an \"epistemic defence,\" or a means of accounting for a failure of medicine's explanatory system. This system is based on diagnosis, or the classification of individual complaints into recognizable diagnostic categories. Diagnosis is pivotal to medicine's epistemic setting, for it purports to explain illness via diagnosis, and yet is not always able to do so. This essay reviews this paradoxical use, and juxtaposes it to historical explanations for non-diagnosable illnesses. It demonstrates how representing non-diagnosis as uncertainty protects the epistemic setting by positioning the failure to locate a diagnosis in the individual, rather than in the medical paradigm.","12":"John Mervin Nooth, military surgeon, correspondent of Joseph Priestly and Benjamin Franklin, and noted inventor and scientist has been lost and found several times, through his eponymous invention: the Nooth apparatus. A large glass apparatus superficially resembling a Kipp's gas generator was used originally for carbonating water during the \"fizzy water\" craze in the eighteenth century, only to be outdone by one Mr. Schweppes. The apparatus would later form part of the first anaesthetic equipment used in surgery, some twenty years after Nooth apparatus ceased to be made. The now part-Nooth apparatus \/ anaesthetiser would then, too, be forgotten again with the advent of the use of nitrous oxide. The Nooth apparatus in the Dublin City University Science Archive was found in a glassware dump in 2000 by the author, and subsequently cleaned, and restored in 2017. It is currently on display, but it is also used, with slight modification, as a gas generator for the undergraduate teaching of trainee teachers with the lesson: \"never throw anything away.\"","13":"Between 1809 and 1813 leading American physician Benjamin Rush (1745-1813) devoted a significant portion of his time to the production of \"American Editions\" of four British and colonial medical texts by Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689), Sir John Pringle (1707-1782), William Hillary (1697-1763), and George Cleghorn (1716-1789). This occurred during a period where Rush might have written a textbook detailing his preferred medical system for students outright. Instead, he opted for a different form of knowledge production and proliferation that focused on creating fictive conversations and encouraging critical reading rather than rote memorization. He dedicated these heavily annotated documents to the medical students of the United States of America and set them up as a pedagogical tool. Analysis of these texts helps uncover the reading practices of Rush and the manner in which he expected Americans to mediate their usage of foreign texts and theories after the American Revolution.","14":"In 1958 the United States of America offered two mobile radioisotope laboratories to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as gifts. For the USA, supplying the IAEA with gifts was not only the cost of \"doing business\" in the new nuclear international setting of the Cold War, but also indispensable in maintaining authority and keeping the upper hand within the IAEA and in the international regulation of nuclear energy. The transformation of a technoscientific artefact into a diplomatic gift with political strings attached for both giver and receiver, positions the lab qua gift as a critical key that simultaneously unlocks the overlapping histories of international affairs, Cold War diplomacy, and postwar nuclear science. Embracing political epistemology as my primary methodological framework and introducing the gift as a major analytic category, I emphasize the role of material objects in modeling scientific research and training in a way that is dictated by diplomatic negotiations, state power, and international legal arrangements.","15":"According to ongoing public discourse, the dental profession in Germany and Austria has found it rather difficult to come to terms with the National Socialist past. Against this background, this study focuses on the practice of awarding honorary memberships by German and Austrian dental societies in the years 1949-1993. In particular, it examines how previous memberships in the Nazi party or other Nazi organisations were handled. We identified a total of 86 honourees, 47 of whom (55 %) were members of the NSDAP during the Third Reich, whereas only two were of Jewish origin. This leads to two conclusions: (1) Previous involvement with Nazi organisations was obviously not a limiting factor in the selection of honourees, and (2) after 1945, the Jewish colleagues were marginalised for a second time-now by being largely overlooked. The reasons of both findings are analysed and contextualised.","16":null,"17":"The material and spatial dimensions documented in the manuscripts of ritual magic that circulated in the medieval and early modern periods have long eluded researchers. Studying where those rituals take place is important to understand the history of the practice of ritual magic. Few attempts have been done to interpret the reasons behind the construction of magic circles and the use of domestic locations. The author introduces a new interpretative category of such ritual spaces: imaginal architectural devices (IADs). IADs pick out a specific kind of portable, spatially unfixed ritual space, where \"magical\" ones are a key example. They are temporary architectural artefacts, attested across a swath of sources of ritual magic, that work as strategic tools for orienting cognition, behavior, and belief. Drawing on spatial theory and cognitive studies, the author constructs IADs as a typological category for comparative analysis. It describes architectural operations that work at the interplay between mental projections and material culture, and that modify the perception of space. In the second part of the article, IADs will be applied to study the circles described in the second section of the Liber Iuratus Honorii, a thirteenth-century handbook containing instructions on how to conjure different ranks of spirits. In the end, the author suggests future directions of research on the transmission of IADs into contemporary ritual magic.","18":"Despite some scepticism, the suggestion by Hartung in 1976 that the report in the chronicle of Gervase of Canterbury corresponded to a meteorite impact with the moon in 1178, creating the Giordano Bruno crater, retains considerable support, particularly in popular scientific writing. Nevertheless, a series of studies of images of the crater from orbiting satellites, although confirming its young geological age, have indicated that it was not created within recorded human history. In this paper, we examine astronomical entries in Gervase's chronicle relating to eclipses and conclude that, despite there being descriptions of miracles elsewhere in the manuscript, he himself was a reliable reporter of astronomical events. On this basis an alternative suggestion can be put forward for the splitting of the horns and writhing of the body of the new moon, reported to Gervase: atmospheric turbulence. Although general atmospheric turbulence has been previously dismissed as too small an effect, it is possible to show that the description is consistent with viewing the new moon through a column of hot air from a fire, at a moderate distance and out of the line of sight of the observers. This interpretation of the medieval evidence as credible but unrelated to a lunar event is consistent with twenty-first century lunar studies.","19":"The history of science as a discipline took place in the period of the German Empire, but the historiography of its development insufficiently recognizes both its proto-institutionalization during this period and the critical role played by Germans in effecting its initial development. In this article, while alluding to the several areas in which Germans took the lead in establishing the discipline, the focus is on one representative area: the mounting of temporary and permanent exhibitions relating to the history of science during the Empire period. Reasons why Germans were motivators in these efforts include the importance of past and present excellence in science, eminence in and fascination with historical research to the new nation's construction after German unification in 1871, and of the assertion of the nineteenth century German bourgeoisie in its role in advancing the culture of the nation. The larger argument, that subjects of the German Empire achieved critical institution-building in history of science, is supported by the incidence of displays organized by Germans, and buttressed by the fact that a number of these organizers also participated in the field's enlarged late nineteenth and early twentieth century scholarship that was most marked among Germans of any national group.","20":"","21":"Black holes are fundamental: They are where small and large scales meet, where the two main theories of physics clash, and where the finite and infinite come together. Furthermore, the explosion of twentieth century black hole science coincided with a shift in the phenomenology of the universe. We consider this philosophical turn towards cosmic mindfulness, and ask whether there are definite limits to our interaction with black holes, and if a human world could ever take direct advantage of the counterintuitive effects happening near a black hole's event horizon.","22":"This paper aims to show how the specific ethics of scientific undertaking tightly underlies epistemic reflection upon the nature of linguistic work and its outcome. The relationship between linguistics and ethics seems evident at the level of the narrative, i.e. the language in which the basic linguistic findings are established. The article is intended as an introduction to an interplay of linguistics, epistemology and the ethics of linguistic work. The departure point for the argument is the CONTAINER perception of language by linguists, which produces the well-established distinction between internalist and externalist positions. The paper, however, invites the reader to reconsider the tension between internalists and externalists and instead argues for a more general opposition, i.e. between the non-transcendental naturalists (naturalists) and transcendental naturalists (extra-naturalists). The polarity is seen as underpinning the present-day debates, while concurrently transversing the traditionally recognised dichotomies. The distinction promises to be productive both at the level of substantive assessment of linguistic research and at the level of epistemic qualification of the outcome of a linguistic study. Sharp and uncompromising as the naturalist vs extra-naturalist dichotomy seems to hold, the paper offers ways to bridge the gap between the apparently exclusive philosophies. The proposed solution, while seemingly only aesthetic, ultimately touches an ethical dimension as it centres on the appropriate construction of the narrative of linguistic fact-finding, which promotes approximative rather than definitive statements in the scholarly discourse. The desired effect is an ethical consensus underlying the work of a linguist.","23":"Studies on the complicity of the medical profession in the crimes of the Third Reich are on the rise. This also applies to the question of the extent to which doctors were brought to justice in international trials after World War II. This topic, however, has hardly been considered-let alone systematically investigated-with respect to German dentists. It is precisely this gap that this article will address. First, we quantitatively identify all dentists who were brought to justice in the post-war period. Second, we give a profile of this group. We focus on the following questions: Who among the group was brought to trial, and when? What crimes were they accused of, which sentences were handed down, and how did these sentences affect their future lives? Our study is based primarily on archival sources, which we analyzed with respect to the relevant secondary literature. Contrary to the widely-held assumption that dentists had almost never had been made to stand trial after the end of the war, we identified 48 dentists who were accused in court. The prototypical accused dentist was male, lived in a traditional family model, belonged to the National Socialist Workers' Party (NSDAP) and the Waffen-SS (Schutzstaffel), and was part of the so-called Kriegsjugendgeneration. The most frequent allegations made against these men were the theft of dental gold of murdered Nazi victims, an accusation unique to dentists; (accessory to) murder or manslaughter; and involvement in the deadly selections made in the concentration camps. In total, eight dentists were executed. Generally speaking, the earlier these proceedings and the sentencing took place, the harsher the sentence was. Many of those who received prison sentences subsequently found their way back into the dental profession.","24":"The term \"street furniture\" indicates objects mostly made of cast iron alloys and aimed to improve the quality of life in urban settlements, such as street lamps, fountains and gazebos. These objects are often ancient and relevant as cultural heritage. Despite the constant presence of street furniture in urban settlements, studies of its evolution along centuries are limited. Since functional aspects have been often considered prevalent against artistic and historical values, many objects have been considered obsolete, thus replaced or re-melted. Street furniture rarely received attention by scholars, and studies on this topic have been often incomplete. This study reviews the history of street furniture made of cast iron (CI street furniture), first examining the reasons behind the choice of this material, closely related to its diffusion during the First Industrial Revolution. The review discusses the relationship between CI street furniture and cultural heritage based on artistic, aesthetic and ethical issues, also examining historical catalogs. The development of CI street furniture in United Kingdom, France and Italy is reported, together with their local aspects. The production technique is discussed and the importance of preservation of CI street furniture is highlighted, emphasizing the need for globally planned interventions in this field.","25":"Conrad Gessner is considered a major encyclopedist of the 16th century. His work is a benchmark in natural history studies. It is an enormous effort that covered the zoological information known until that century. In his publications, illustrations were a fundamental component that paralleled the textual narratives. Those noteworthy images followed different paths before being re-conceived as xylographies to be printed as part of those natural history books and presented to the public. A large set of drawings used by Gessner in the Felix Platter collection remained unknown and hidden for almost four centuries in Amsterdam. The colorful primates of this collection stand as reminders of an early history of the circulation of scientific knowledge and imaginaries of animals. They visually influenced further zoological works and were initial accounts about the diversity of this mammal group.","26":"The Puerto Rico Trench is a deep oceanic subduction zone that runs parallel with the northern coasts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. It is the deepest place in the Atlantic Ocean with a maximum depth of approximately 8400 m. Discovered by the HMS Challenger Expedition in 1875, the depth of the trench increased multiple times in the ensuing 100 years with the onset of sonar usage. It is perhaps unique among the world's deep trenches in that a series of unrelated but equally pioneering expeditions captured the true biological and geological characteristics of one of the deepest places in the world, observations that are still highly relevant today. Multiple deep water trawling campaigns and surveys using drop cameras and exploratory dives in a deep diving submersible provided great insight into the morphology of the trench, the types of habitat within the trench, the substrate, the food supply, and the diversity of species that inhabit these extraordinary depths. Many of these accounts are obscure and disparate, yet combined bear a remarkable similarity to recent work in other trenches. These unique and insightful accounts are collated and retold here alongside recent and comparable findings to contextualise these discoveries, prevent them from being forgotten, and keep the efforts of those involved to remain relevant as we continue to explore the deepest places of the world's oceans.","27":null,"28":"Charles Lyell's life work, the influential textbook and philosophical treatise The Principles of Geology, helped to shape the Victorian age. There were few diversions from the central task of the Principles of Geology in the course of the twelve editions. Perhaps the most significant and notable was the discovery and investigation of loess; a silty sediment, often of considerable thickness, and widely distributed in the Rhine valley. He made a significant contribution to loess studies and, with his father-in-law, Leonard Horner, explored the loess regions of the Rhine Valley. The loess period lasted roughly from 1830 to 1836, and he established the first paradigm theory for the formation of loess deposits from deposition in a lake or perhaps from slow-moving water. This held sway until displaced by the aeolian theory of F. von Richthofen.","29":"The invention of partition chromatography by the biochemists Archer Martin and Richard Synge in 1941 offered crucial insights into the structure and function of DNA, insights at least as important as those from X-ray crystallography. Even so, the role that partition chromatography played in molecular biological studies is far less well known. Using new archival material, this article describes the origins of Martin and Synge's work, arguing that their achievement was far more than a new technical innovation; it went on to have a profound impact on the development of molecular biology to an extent that scholars have insufficiently appreciated.","30":"The independence of science was long seen as of prime importance. This position has become less common today. The perception of scientific research as a public service has led to the opinion that it must be accountable to citizens and produce knowledge and innovation that meet their expectations. Numerous authors have voiced the need for anticipatory ethical control of innovation focusing on the scientific research process. This control is considered as the must-have guarantee for \"good science.\" The current article attempts to trace the ideological origins of the ethical control of innovation, examines its effectiveness against the challenge of globalization and technology-derived major threats and its compatibility with scientific methodology. It also suggests ways to both regulate the innovation process and preserve the independence of science. On the whole, we conclude that truly effective ethical regulation of innovation, i.e. one that protects the greatest number from its adverse effects, is achieved first and foremost by questioning our liberal economic model and the place given to science in our societies.","31":"At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the landscape of emerging experimental embryology in the United States was dominated by the Canadian Frank Rattray Lillie, who combined his qualities as scientist and director with those of teacher at the University of Chicago. In the context of his research on chick development, he encouraged the young Marian Lydia Shorey to investigate the interactions between the central nervous system and the peripheral structures. The results were published in two papers which marked the beginning of a new branch of embryology, namely neuroembryology. These papers inspired ground-breaking enquiry by Viktor Hamburger which opened a new area of the research by Rita Levi-Montalcini, in turn leading to the discovery of the nerve growth factor, NGF.","32":"In the 1950s, China is widely regarded as having made great achievements in the control of schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever. Despite the success, efforts to prevent the disease did not fare well during the Reform period (1978-present). Given this, several key questions need to be addressed. Was the schistosomiasis control campaign a real success in the context of political fervor? Would a schistosomiasis control policy be successful only when it returns to the Maoist medical model, as Miriam Gross argues? Did schistosomiasis return as advertised, or was it never eliminated since the 1950s? In this article, I argue that (1) schistosomiasis control is widely regarded as a great success in an ecological sense, but as far as a long-term mechanism of control is concerned, an approach that relies exclusively on strong political intervention and mass participation may not be effective; (2) schistosomiasis control should first focus on the establishment of a sustainable, long-term mechanism, rather than a temporary, assault-style approach to the problem; and (3) from the 1950s to the present, the spread of schistosomiasis does not represent its return, but, rather, the failure of control efforts to eliminate it.","33":"In 2019, the world scientific community celebrates the 110th anniversary of the death of Nikolai Vasilevich Sorokin (1846-1909), an eminent Russian biologist. On this occasion, this paper reviews the life and work of Sorokin, who was known for many important scientific breakthroughs, particularly in botany, mycology, and microbiology. Drawing upon Sorokin's publications and unpublished papers from archives, this account traces his key educational influences and the development of his research interests, research-related travels, contributions to the Russian movement in women's higher education, and his key publications, particularly his four-volume treatise on plant parasites.","34":"This article draws attention to literary works which have been influenced by microscopy, or in which microscopy has played a significant role. The work of writers including Jonathan Swift, Voltaire, George Eliot, H. G. Wells and D. H. Lawrence is discussed. In many cases these authors had direct experience of operating microscopes and viewing the wonders of the microscopic world. However, with the increasing separation of the two cultures, recent examples of microscopy in literature are rare.","35":"In 1923, Conrad Hal Waddington was in his final year at Clifton College, Bristol, UK, being taught chemistry by Dr. Eric John Holmyard. During this year, Waddington and Holmyard both wrote about alchemy, the former in an extended school essay and the latter in the journal Nature. Almost twenty years later, Holmyard and Waddington were instrumental in the formation of the journal Endeavour in 1942. Using recently discovered primary source materials and unpublished manuscripts, the influence of Holmyard and alchemy on the early development of Waddington's thinking is explored, including his subsequent attraction to Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the impact on his epigenetic research.","36":"In 1939, an unusual card game, Physogs, debuted in the United Kingdom. Based on physiognomic principles, it instructed players as to how to read and construct facial features and character types. Thirty years later, a new form of composite facial recognition, Photofit, was incorporated into the practice of the British police. Both projects, Physogs and Photofit, were the brainchild of one man, Jacques Penry, representing his twentieth-century iteration of physiognomy. How did a card game become an origin point for a new approach to policing?","37":"","38":"The life and works of the English Renaissance polymath John Dee (1527-1609) have been traditionally treated by scholarship in the context of the history of philosophy and science. Only in recent decades have two of John Dee's most prominent and controversial endeavors - (1) his political philosophy and advocacy of a British Empire (a term he is credited with coining), and (2) his long-standing practice of angelic magic - been reconstructed in their significance to Dee's worldview. This paper highlights how Dee's visions of a British Empire and his angelic rituals were not only major landmarks in his corpus, but were intimately interconnected in Dee's ideology of \"Cosmopolitics.\" Dee's \"esoteric imperialism\" is situated in the context of his intellectual, textual, and political environment, and his angelic magic is identified as fitting within the medieval Solomonic current. It is argued that both ideological trends coalesced in Dee's vision of an angelic-inspired British Empire.","39":"","40":"In 1905 the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University began planning for a new domesticated animals exhibition in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder Louis Agassiz. The resulting displays of variation and heredity in poultry, pigeons, rabbits, mice, and guinea pigs proved surprisingly popular to museumgoers. Some of these specimens still exist in the museum's storage facilities, namely a series of poultry donated by the biologist Charles B. Davenport and an elaborate set of guinea pigs from the experimental evolutionist William E. Castle. Situating these domesticated animal displays within academic and popular cultures of poultry fancying, animal breeding, and evolutionary science reveals how a nineteenth-century museum known for its ties to anti-evolutionary principles attempted to modernize its public exhibits.","41":"Richard Julius Petri's status as inventor of the culture dish that bears his name has been subject to a number of challenges over the years. Both those bacteriologists who claimed self-recognition for the invention, and those to whom it was attributed by their various advocates were all contemporaries of Petri. The evidence assembled here indicates that no single individual-including Petri-ought to be accorded credit for the inception of that shallow, circular, covered culture dish which, it transpires, is a simultaneous invention made by half a dozen bacteriologists active in the mid-1880s and ultimately owes its emergence to the prevailing bacteriological zeitgeist.","42":"How did ordinary people - artisans, laborers, servants, and children - come to know the Newtonian universe? And what effects did this knowledge have on how they contextualized their place in society? When it appeared in 1733, Henry Bridges' \"Modern Microcosm\" promised to give paying customers a view of the entire universe ingeniously recreated in a ten-foot-tall automaton theater. A hit with audiences, this clockwork wonder was displayed in Britain and the American colonies until disappearing mysteriously in the 1770s. This paper attempts to recover non-elite understandings of public science by examining the career of an astronomical wonder in the rowdy marketplace of ideas that was the London show scene.","43":null,"44":"A lost zoological collection was found in an old school in Lisbon, Portugal. Taxidermied animals, fauna preserved in glass jars, skeletons, and fossilized shells were all part of this collection. The research showed that those animals were used by libertarian teachers in science classes in a school created by republicans and freemasons in the transition from the 19th to the 20th century.","45":"The printed Elements in the sixteenth century presented more practical and functional diagrams than those of previous manuscripts. Whereas conventional diagrams were limited to implementing the description of the text, the new diagrams introduced more concise constructions and visual auxiliaries. This change toward more practical and functional diagrams reflects the increased emphasis on the pedagogical value of the diagram. As is evident from the compass arcs upon the diagram, readers of the Elements were invited to draw their own diagrams, deviating from tradition and also from the text. Also, the increased visual auxiliaries such as correspondence markers, dotted lines, and stereoscopic presentations enabled the reader to read diagrams more easily. This backdrop of increased engagement with the diagram made it easier for mathematical novices (tyrones) to learn the Elements. These tool-based and auxiliaries-laden diagrams were more effective for teaching beginners than the earlier, less-functional diagrams. This paper explores the function of these new visual vocabularies and how they were circulated. This survey comprises a brief history of how diagrams began to have their say.","46":"In a specific tradition of dealing with algebraic equations in China, eleventh to thirteenth century writings on the topic combine problems, algorithms, and diagrams of several types. This article focuses on the geometrical diagrams that some of them contain. The argument holds that the captions in these diagrams establish a specific connection with the algorithms in relation to which they are given. Accordingly, I claim that these diagrams constitute the proof of the correctness of the algorithms. Reading the diagrams as assertions is thus in my view essential to capture what is at stake in them. These diagrams disappear from another tradition of dealing with algebraic equations in China, to which writings from the second half of the thirteenth century and the early fourteenth century attest. I suggest that these diagrams are replaced by a form of algebraic proof in an algorithmic context, which is also expressed in specific ways.","47":"I consider the role of diagrams in contemporary mathematics. More specifically the role of certain diagrams-so-called directed graphs-will be investigated. I propose that these graphs act as mediating objects. This means that they link certain objects, that is, a C*-algebra and its associated K-groups, and that this link yields an epistemic gain. I explain that the link is possible because a graph represents as a metaphor in two distinct ways. In addition, the diagrammatic presentation of a directed graph becomes an object that can be manipulated. As such, it becomes what I will denote a \"faithful representation.\" The notion of a faithful representation tries to capture the fruitfulness of the combination of metaphorical representation with the possibility of controlled manipulation.","48":null,"49":"","50":"The objective of this article is to take into account the functioning of representational cognitive tools, and in particular of notations and visualizations in mathematics. In order to explain their functioning, formulas in algebra and logic and diagrams in topology will be presented as case studies and the notion of manipulative imagination as proposed in previous work will be discussed. To better characterize the analysis, the notions of material anchor and representational affordance will be introduced.","51":"In 1670 the Sicilian painter Agostino Scilla (1629-1700) devised an entirely new way of depicting fossils when he wrote and illustrated his Vain Speculation Undeceived by Sense (1670-1671), which argued that fossils were the remains of once living creatures and not mimetic stones. This essay explores the nature of Scilla's graphic innovations, comparing his fossils drawings and Pietro Santi Bartoli's engravings of them to earlier and contemporary images of fossils. Scilla captured the effect of time on nature by infusing his style of drawing with his philosophical understanding of what it means to see and to know. He made his drawing less rich in detail to focus on those which served his purpose. In particular, he made the first use of dotted lines in paleontological illustration to render his images dynamic theoretical interpretations rather than static depictions.","52":"From his earliest student days through the writing of his last book, Charles Darwin drew diagrams. In developing his evolutionary ideas, his preferred form of diagram was the tree. An examination of several of Darwin's trees-from sketches in a private notebook from the late 1830s through the diagram published in the Origin-opens a window onto the role of diagramming in Darwin's scientific practice. In his diagrams, Darwin simultaneously represented both observable patterns in nature and conjectural narratives of evolutionary history. He then brought these natural patterns and narratives into dialogue, allowing him to explore whether the narratives could explain the patterns. But Darwin's diagrams did not reveal their meaning directly to passive readers; they required readers to engage dynamically with them in order to understand the connections they disclosed between patterns and narratives. Moreover, the narratives Darwin depicted in his diagrams did not represent past sequences of events that he claimed had actually occurred; the narratives were conjectural, schematic, and probabilistic. Instead of depicting actual histories in all their particularity, Darwin depicted narratives in his diagrams in order to make general claims about how nature works. The conjunction of these features of Darwin's diagrams is central to how they do their epistemic work.","53":"John Pringle Nichol (1804-1859), a Scottish Romantic astronomer, educator, and social reformer, used visual representations to develop and communicate key elements of his theory of evolution as a universal principle. Examining four of the diverse representations that appeared in Nichol's popular science books between 1846 and 1850 reveals the rich possibilities of evolutionary imagery prior to the emergence of more dominant forms of representation in the wake of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). The abstract and schematic nature of many of Nichol's visual representations-which included line diagrams and imaginative, mythic imagery (the latter developed in collaboration with the Scottish Romantic artist David Scott)-made them apt vessels for his Romantic evolutionary concepts, because a single image could simultaneously represent features of evolution across multiple domains, reflecting the Romantic concept of the unity of nature and the myriad analogies between its constituent parts. All of the images embodied narrative in one form or another and required use of the imagination in the act of interpretation. Many of the images facilitated the viewer's ability to conceptualize unobservable or only partially observable features of evolutionary change. Even as these visual representations acted as tools of perspective, insight, and clarity, they also helped to generate new ambiguities, such as a fundamental tension between teleology and contingency.","54":"Between 1834 and 1860 the British government mobilised the latest scientific knowledge in the construction of the new Palace of Westminster, home to the nation's Houses of Parliament. Built in a Gothic style, this legislative building embodied the latest experimental techniques and expertise from geology, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, and optics. By exploring the narrative of this architectural project, it becomes clear just how central scientific values were to Victorian politics. At the same time, this article shows how the experience of constructing Britain's nineteenth-century parliament building has implications and lessons for parliamentary architecture today.","55":"The global network to eradicate blindness emerged out of the work of Western and South Asian professionals to eradicate smallpox which was endemic in South Asia. The history of the emergence of the global network to eradicate blindness demonstrates a shift from vertical command and control public health programs directed by the WHO, to the decentralized public health services originating in non-profit, non-governmental organizations and coordinated by the WHO. The WHO constitution started with a federal regionalist structure that encouraged collaboration and coordination with NGOs. In South Asia in particular, epidemiologists and general medical practitioners moved from eradicating smallpox through the WHO to creating their own domestic and international NGOs based in various countries with a mission to control blindness in South Asia and Africa. In 1975, pushed by the WHO Director General, these new NGOs in turn joined with individual ophthalmologists and existing blind member associations to form the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. Thus, the WHO was shaped by, and shaping, international NGOs such as the IAPB. The IAPB pushed for the formation of the WHO Prevention of Blindness program. This was the earliest example of how the IAPB facilitates bottom-up agenda-setting in the WHO. In 1980, when the WHO officially closed the smallpox program, the Prevention of Blindness program first received independent funding. Presently, the IAPB acts as a decentralized arm of the WHO.","56":"In the 1950s, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) engaged in close cooperation with the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The CAS sent scientists to the Soviet Academy to work as interns, study for advanced degrees, or engage in academic cooperation, and a large number of Soviet scientists were invited by the various institutes of the CAS to come to China to give lectures, direct research, help make scientific plans, and collaborate. The comprehensive cooperation between the two academies was launched at a time when the CAS institutes were in their embryonic stage, which suggests that the better-established Soviet scientists had the opportunity to play a dominate role. But the reality is not so straightforward. The case studies in this paper suggest that besides the influence of compatible political movements in China and the Soviet Union and bilateral ties between these two nations' scientific institutes, disharmony in actual working relationships prevented Soviet scientists from playing the role they might have envisioned within the CAS institutes. The rapid development of the cooperative relationship in a short span of time, combined with lack of experience on both sides, made for a disharmonious collaboration.","57":"In November 1843 John Cassidy, curator in the Belfast Museum received, perhaps rather dolefully, a collection of bird skins. The Museum was barely managing to cope with the constant flow of donations from the 'four quarters of the globe'. But the gift of bird skins could not be ignored. Sent by Captain Francis Crozier, recently returned from the British Antarctic Expedition, the bequest contained 150 species of Southern Ocean birds, including the remains of two immature 'great penguins'. Taking the one surviving specimen as a focal point, this paper compares and contrasts the ways in which Aptenodytes forsteri, or the emperor penguin, was differently scripted on board ship and in the museum. The lively interpretations and close encounters with emperor penguins on the ice and on board the two naval bomb vessels are set alongside the more constrained meanings and fleeting attention given to them in a metropolitan and a provincial museum.","58":"Contemporary policy debates construct public involvement in England's National Health Service as \"new,\" or as a practice dating back only as far as the 1990s. This article argues that the longer historical contexts of such consultative practice matter, and it explores various and shifting manifestations of \"consultation\" in the NHS from the foundation of the Service in 1948. In doing so, it first demonstrates that consultation has always been a part of the theory and practice of postwar health policy. Thinking about consultation as \"new\" presents such practice as unnecessary or transient, and may function as part of a damaging political vision of public affection for the NHS as a barrier to reform. Second, the article asserts that public interest in shaping NHS practice and policy has never been fully satisfied by official consultative mechanisms. \"The public\" is not a homogeneous group, but rather composed of various groups, communities, and individuals with rich perspectives and histories to share, having experienced the NHS as patients, friends, supporters, staff, and volunteers. Policy-makers should approach diverse publics as partners, and should meaningfully listen to protests around NHS reform, which often reflect public investment in the NHS, as well as valid concerns about how particular communities will be able to access health care. While the political will for such engagement has varied over time, individual politicians and local-level health agencies can make a difference by supporting, engaging with, and funding organizations which represent and empower a diverse range of communities: such groups have always, and will continue to play, a significant role in shaping NHS debate and care.","59":"In postwar Tokyo, ornithologist Oliver L. Austin's leadership of the Wildlife Branch of the Natural Resources Section (NRS) for the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) serves as an intriguing lens into the reconstruction of Japanese conservation activities. His experiences as a scientist working on wildlife policies in US-occupied Korea (1945-1946) and Japan (1946-1949) illuminate the war's impact on individuals and their environment. Austin collaborated closely with elite Japanese colleagues, despite their ruined laboratories, burnt collections, inadequate shelter, and despair. Science and conservation provided a common language for intimate connections. Why did these collaborations fail in Korea, but succeed in Japan? How did postwar political realities shape scientific research, conservation, and environmental policies? I propose that what anthropologist and occupation official John W. Bennett calls \"colleagueship\" (citing sociologist Everett Hughes), or \"the establishing of intellectual links across political and cultural boundaries in the modern world,\" offers a useful model for understanding the revival of these oftentimes trans-war relationships.","60":"In the spring of 1944 Sister Marie Immaculate was awarded a Master of Science degree for research on penicillin which she had conducted at St John's University in Brooklyn, New York. She gave her motivation for undertaking research in this topic as wishing to fulfil her patriotic duty by participating in the quest towards making penicillin more readily available to all who needed it. It is possible that contemporary media reports suggesting that the power of penicillin was comparable to a miracle cure contributed to her interest in the subject at the time. In practical terms, her work was to have no bearing in increasing the availability of penicillin, but simply by becoming engaged in this endeavour, it could be argued that she was enacting the beliefs underlying her religious calling. This article explores those beliefs, and proposes an ideological synergy between science and religion in respect to Sister Marie Immaculate's faith in penicillin's potential to cure the world's ills.","61":"Mr. Robot is a television drama with an unusually techno-cynical premise, tying cybersecurity to the contemporary malaise of social alienation and political disengagement. Weary of consumer capitalism, the show's youthful protagonists seek a more authentic sense of belonging by exploiting the vulnerability of a global economic system that depends critically on creaking technological infrastructures. A remarkable display of iconoclasm for commercial entertainment, Mr. Robot suggests rising discontentment with the commodification of friendship through consumer electronics, but it may also offer media enterprises a model for how to profit from that discontentment in the future.","62":"The construction of nine high-end technical installations (hereafter Project NGI, for Nine Great Installations or ) in the 1960s and 1970s was an indispensable part of the development of China's defense and heavy industries. The project put more than 1400 machines into operation or trial operation during the Culture Revolution (1966-1976), and they served essential technical functions in sectors such as aviation, aerospace, machinery, metallurgy, and electronics, and directly advancing the development of these fields. It took more than a decade for Project NGI to go from planning to completion-a surprisingly uninterrupted and steady development while China fell into unprecedented turmoil. One important reason for Project NGI's success was the vital leadership of Shen Hong (, 1906-1998), the technical director of the project and a high-ranking official. Supported by state leaders such as Zhou Enlai and Nie Rongzhen, Shen and his colleagues adopted a suitable roadmap for technological development, coordinated the best-performing manufacturing forces in the country, and successfully manufactured the NGI machines. Project NGI is significant for the history of Chinese science, technology, and medicine during the Cultural Revolution not because it was technologically original, but because it represents an extraordinary case, in which the project's technological development seemed to be largely exempted from the interference of the turbulent Cultural Revolution. The project's national defense orientation, its pragmatism, and the contemporary dogma of self-reliance (), in addition to Shen Hong's political maneuvering, all contributed to the creation of a relatively calm and favorable environment around Project NGI. Despite the widespread turmoil in the country, Shen managed to assemble a stable and continuously productive team, which executed experiments, absorbed previously introduced Soviet technologies, stayed informed about advanced European and American technologies, and ultimately accomplished the construction of the NGI machines.","63":"In 1972, the Minnesota United Power Association (UPA) teamed up with the Minnesota Cooperative Power Association (CPA) to initiate an electrification project designed to bring power from North Dakota to the Twin Cities area. A significant backlash and protest began once farmers across the state became aware of the plan and the potential impending land seizure. In the midst of these actions, one group sought to create an alternative to the power line transmission system by designing a system of wireless energy transmission based on the plans of Nikola Tesla. This self-funded conglomeration of farmers and amateur researchers formed the People's Power Project (PPP) and set about building Tesla's system for the wireless transmission of energy. Using archival documents, this paper recounts this episode and argues that, in this case, the potential for successful grassroots action was derailed by the influence of longstanding myths about Tesla and his devices.","64":"Before 1966, Chinese mathematician Hua Loo-Keng had singled out \"Two Methods\" as a way to truly applied and useful mathematics. The Overall Planning Method, based on the Critical Path Method widely used in USA, mostly appealed to middle and upper management. This limited its spread during the Cultural Revolution. The Optimum Selection Method, also of US origin, was more mass-oriented and ready for popularization. Nevertheless, Hua met resistance from leftist radicals, whose ideological objections sprang from an underlying power struggle. Hua built popularization teams, mostly from talented younger people whose careers were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution, and thus opened a path for many of them to important roles in China's scientific infrastructure after 1976. Hua Loo-Keng's efforts, while interrupted during the Cultural Revolution and the subsequent political campaigns, were also helped by the populist ethos of the movement, and by the lack of other non-political endeavors at that time. In this sense, the Cultural Revolution gave Hua Loo-Keng's popularization its importance and long-term impact.","65":"This article discusses why Chinese space programs were able to develop to the extent they did during the turbulent decade of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). It first introduces briefly what China had accomplished in rocket and missile technology before the Cultural Revolution, including the establishment of a system for research and manufacturing, breakthroughs in rocket technology, and programs for future development. It then analyzes the harmful impacts of the Cultural Revolution on Chinese space programs by examining activities of contemporary mass factions in the Seventh Ministry of Machinery Industry. In the third section, this article presents the important developments of Chinese space programs during the Cultural Revolution and explores briefly the significance of these developments for the future and overall progress in space technology. Finally, it discusses the reasons for the series of developments of Chinese space technology during the Cultural Revolution. This article concludes that, although the Cultural Revolution generated certain harmful impacts on the development of Chinese space technology, the Chinese essentially accomplished their scheduled objectives in their space program, both because of the great support of top Chinese leaders, including the officially disgraced Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, and due to the implementation of many effective special measures.","66":"","67":"Small drops of liquid brought into contact with very hot surfaces float above it as beautiful, slightly flattened spheroids without coming to the boil. An example of film boiling, drops that are sessile can often suddenly and quite unexpectedly start to oscillate forming highly symmetric patterns of surprising pulchritude. The rim of these oscillating drops take on \"star-shaped\" patterns with many different modes of vibration possible. Still an object of study today, their discovery, early accounts, rediscovery and ensuing controversies over claims of priority, before quietly slipping away from the collective memory of the scientific community to become all but forgotten makes for a compelling story in the early history of film boiling. The episode serves not only as a valuable reminder of the importance the history of science can play in highlighting past achievements that would otherwise remain unknown to the modern practitioner. It also provides an example of how external pressures and personal ambition can often influence the work of a scientist in their pursuit of self-recognition and acclaim amongst their peers.","68":"The story of discovery of artemisinin highlights the diversity of scientific values across time and space. Resituating artemisinin research within a broader temporal framework allows us to understand how Chinese drugs like qinghao came to articulate a space for scientific experimentation and innovation through its embodiment of alternating clusters of meanings associated with tu and yang within scientific discourse. Tu science, which was associated with terms like native, Chinese, local, rustic, mass, and crude, articulated a radical vision of science in the service of socialist revolutionary ideals. Yang science, which signified foreign, Western, elite, and professional, tended to bear the hallmarks of professionalism, transnational networks in education and training, and an emphasis on basic or foundational research. With respect to medical research, the case of artemisinin highlights how the constitution of socialist science as an interplay of tu and yang engendered different scientific values and parameters for scientific endeavor. Modern medical research in Maoist China could harness the productive energies of mass participation to technical expertise in its investigations of Chinese drugs, and under the banner of tu science, it became possible and scientifically legitimate to research Chinese drugs in ways that had previously provoked resistance and controversy.","69":"Barefoot doctors were rural medical personnel trained en masse, whose emergence and development had a particular political, economic, social, and cultural background. Like the rural cooperative medical care system, the barefoot doctor was a well-known phenomenon in the Cultural Revolution. Complicated regional differences and a lack of reliable sources create much difficulty for the study of barefoot doctors and result in differing opinions of their status and importance. Some scholars greatly admire barefoot doctors, whereas others harshly criticize them. This paper explores the rise and development of barefoot doctors based on a case study of Shandong province. I argue that the promotion of barefoot doctors was a consequence of the medical education revolution and an implementation of the Cultural Revolution in rural public health care, which significantly influenced medical services and development in rural areas. First, barefoot doctors played a significant role in accomplishing the first rural health care revolution by providing primary health care to peasants and eliminating endemic and infectious illnesses. Second, barefoot doctors were the agents who integrated Western and Chinese medicines under the direction of the state. As an essential part of the rural cooperative medical system, barefoot doctor personnel grew in number with the system's implementation. After the Cultural Revolution ended, the cooperative medical system began to disintegrate-a process that accelerated in the 1980s until the system's collapse in the wake of the de-collectivization. As a result, the number of barefoot doctors also ran down steadily. In 1985, \"barefoot doctor\" as a job title was officially removed from Chinese medical profession, demonstrating that its practice was non-universal and unsustainable.","70":"Recent scholarly attentions have shifted from key actors within the scientific elite and religious authorities to scientific practitioners and popularizers who used science to pursue a wide variety of cultural purposes. The Roman Catholic zoologist St. George Mivart (1827-1900) has typically been cast as a staunch anti-Darwinian ostracized by Darwin's inner circle of scientific naturalists. Understood as a popularizer of science, his position can be re-thought. Mivart did not operate on the periphery of Victorian science. Instead, his notable contributions to the fields of zoology and anatomy and his participation in debates about the origin of the human mind, consciousness, and soul made him a central figure in the changing landscape of late-Victorian scientific culture. Through the popular periodical press and his anatomy textbook for beginners, Mivart secured a reputation as a key spokesman for science and gained authority as a leading critic of agnostic scientific naturalism.","71":"This paper uses the case of hybrid rice to chart changes in the meanings science has carried in China from the Mao era to today. It begins by using Chinese journal articles to reconstruct the 1970s development of hybrid rice technology by a network of diverse historical actors. It then documents the emergence during the Hua Guofeng era (1976-1978) of a historical narrative of hybrid rice centered on the figures of Yuan Longping and Hua Guofeng. Finally, it surveys post-1978 biographies of Yuan Longping to identify changes and continuities in scientific values. The paper demonstrates that, although the reform era has witnessed the replacement of most of the Maoist vision of mass (or tu) science with a vision far more consistent with the values of international, professional (yang) science, the legacy of the Mao era can still be seen in a continued emphasis on certain aspects of Mao Zedong Thought, a strong narrative of nationalist triumphalism, and a celebration of Yuan Longping as an \"intellectual peasant.\"","72":"Julius Hallervorden, a distinguished German neuropathologist, admitted on several occasions that he had received some five hundred brains of \"euthanasia\" victims from the Nazi killing centres for the insane. He investigated the brains in the summer of 1942; however, their traces were subsequently lost. The present study shows, that the Series H, which was part of the Hallervorden collection of brain sections in the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, comprises the brain sections of the above mentioned five hundred euthanasia victims. The provenance of 105 patients could be reconstructed and 84 are for sure euthanasia victims. Most of them were killed in Bernburg or in Sonnenstein-Pirna. Hallervorden used the brain sections of Series H until 1956 for his studies and never publicly regretted this abuse of the brains of euthanasia victims.","73":"","74":"The meeting of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences (VASKhNIL) that occurred from July 31 to August 7, 1948, declared Michurinism to be the only \"correct theory\" of biology in the Soviet Union. As of that moment, Michurinist biology officially took center stage in Soviet scientific institutions, and it was further developed over the next fifteen years. Scientists from all of the former Soviet Republics participated in the Michurinist campaign. In Lithuania, this campaign started in the autumn of 1948. From 1948 until 1963, the Department of Michurinist Biology was active at Vilnius University. Studies in this field were performed at Lithuanian scientific institutions, and scientists were engaged with this theory. This essay illustrates the realization of the Michurinist campaign in Lithuania using details from botany. It describes the investigations of plant genetics in Lithuania before World War II, depicts the general situation of scientists in Lithuania during the first years of the Soviet occupation, explores the involvement of botanists in propagating Michurinist biology, and in summary, reveals the peculiarities of this campaign in Lithuania.","75":"","76":"","77":"In a nuclear laboratory, a glove box is a windowed, sealed container equipped with two flexible gloves that allow the user to manipulate nuclear materials from the outside in an ostensibly safe environment. As a routine laboratory device, it invites neglect from historians and storytellers of science. Yet, since especially the Gulf War, glove boxes have put the interdependence of science, diplomacy, and politics into clear relief. Standing at the intersection of history of science and international history, technological materials and devices such as the glove box can provide penetrating insight into the role of international diplomatic organizations to the global circulation and control of scientific knowledge. The focus here is on the International Atomic Energy Agency.","78":"For decades creationists have claimed that Charles Darwin sought the skulls of full-blooded Aboriginal Tasmanian people when only four were left alive.

Bohr accepted their invitations and made the trip in 1937; however, the topics of his lectures in the two countries differed. In Japan, he mainly discussed quantum mechanics and philosophy, whereas in China, he focused more on atomic physics. This paper begins with a detailed review of Bohr's trip to Japan and China in 1937, followed by a discussion of the impact of each trip from the perspective of the social context. We conclude that the actual effect of Bohr's visit to China and Japan involved not only the spreading of Bohr's knowledge but also clearly hinged on the current status and social background of the recipients. Moreover, the impact of Bohr's trip to East Asia demonstrates that, as is the case for scientific exchanges at the international level, the international exchange of knowledge at the individual level is also powerful, and such individual exchange can even promote exchange on the international level.","81":"Why do people fight wars? Following the devastation of the Second World War, this question became particularly pressing. Postwar scholars in the human sciences, from political science to anthropology, investigated the role of human nature in the causes of war even as they debated the very meaning of human nature itself. Among the wide-ranging efforts of postwar social and behavioral scientists to explain the causes of war, research on primate aggression became a compelling approach to studying the evolution of human warfare. In contrast, primatologist Frans de Waal's popular and scientific publications on primate reconciliation emphasized the naturalness of conflict resolution and peacemaking, thereby providing a counterpoint to the pessimism of aggression research while simultaneously shoring up the logic of simian analogy. De Waal's popular books heralded the \"make love, not war\" bonobo as humans' evolutionary next-of-kin and contributed to raising public interest in bonobos during the late twentieth century, although the apes' popular reputation subsequently exceeded the scientific discourse about them.","82":"Stephen Jay Gould was a paleontologist and scientific celebrity at the close of the twentieth century, most famous for his popular writings on evolution and his role in the American creationist controversies of that era. In the early 1980s, Gould was drawn into the \"nuclear winter\" episode through his friendship with Carl Sagan, an astronomer and popular science celebrity. Sagan helped develop the theory of nuclear winter and subsequently used the theory as evidence to petition the United States government to scale back its nuclear armament. The theory of nuclear winter claimed that even a small nuclear exchange could result in a atmospheric blackening akin to the extinction event of the late Cretaceous. Gould was not a climate scientist but he testified before the U.S. House of Representatives as an expert on historical extinction events. Gould's insistence on the value-neutrality of nuclear winter reveals much about the moral politics of science in late Cold War America. Coming at the heels of leftist scientific activism of the 1980s, the nuclear winter episode demonstrates how value-neutrality emerged the salient feature of scientific involvement in American politics in this period.","83":"Throughout the twentieth century, contemporary understandings of evolutionary theory were tightly linked to visions of the future freighted with moral consequence. This essay traces the origins and legacy of this scientific commitment to a universal family of man in postwar evolutionary theory, and elaborates how evolutionary scientists sought to reframe the politics of human evolution by claiming that the principles governing the physical past of humanity differed fundamentally from those that would matter in the coming decades, centuries, or even millennia. Education and public engagement embodied the moral importance of actively participating in the creation of that better, future world.","84":"I discuss biologist Garrett Hardin's view of human nature, with examples from the background to his seminal 1968 essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" and his testimony before the US House of Representatives in the 1970s. Hardin saw the human species as being governed by deterministic laws of the same kind that controlled all other forms of life. Humans, as much as cattle and microbes, were in inevitable competition for space and resources. Equal parts Malthusian political economy and Cold War systems science, his view was the survival of the human race depended on obeying these iron laws. Human freedom was the recognition of-and obedience to-its nature. This determination for humanity to act within the strictures placed on itself by its own nature was what he called \"lifeboat ethics.\" In order for the citizens of the rich countries to survive, many in the Third World would have to die. In this sense I characterize Hardin's sense of life as tragic, both as a play on the title of his famous essay, and to emphasize his view that the problem of human population growth had no 'win-win' solutions.","85":"No direct evidence documents exactly how Jane Seymour gave birth on October 12, 1537. Several later commentators have raised cesarean birth as an option. This paper tries to establish the probable cause of Jane Seymour's death in accordance with present-day knowledge of obstetrics and whether or not a cesarean section could have been actually performed in sixteenth-century England. It appears almost certainly that there were no obstetrical indications that would have led the Queen's physicians to operate on her, a surgeon was not present at her delivery, cesarean section on a living woman was not regularly performed in England in 1537, puerperium events do not support surgery, and the existing pro-cesarean confirmation was politically motivated. Therefore, the most likely mode of Jane Seymour's delivery was vaginal rather than cesarean.","86":"","87":"Fossils are crucial pieces of evidence that illuminate the past. In the case of paleoanthropology, the discipline that studies human evolution, fossils are tangible objects that shape the ways we understand ourselves and our history. But how, exactly, do fossils find their way into these narratives, and into scientific journals and museums? How do they become pieces of evidence? The Forbes skull reveals a fossil that struggled to become a noteworthy piece of evidence. It was twice lost, first in a library cabinet on the Rock of Gibraltar, and later, in a London museum storeroom. The Forbes fossil's story reminds us that science takes place in particular times and places, and that the ways we think about human origins are contingent on those circumstances.","88":"The Asilomar conference on genetic engineering in 1975 has long been pointed to by scientists as a model for internal regulation and public engagement. In 2015, the organizers of the International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Washington, DC looked to Asilomar as they sought to address the implications of the new CRISPR gene editing technique. Like at Asilomar, the conveners chose to limit the discussion to a narrow set of potential CRISPR applications, involving inheritable human genome editing. The adoption by scientists in 2015 of an Asilomar-like script for discussing genetic engineering offers historians the opportunity to analyze the adjustments that have been made since 1975, and to identify the blind spots that remain in public engagement. Scientists did take important lessons from the fallout of their limited engagement with public concerns at Asilomar. Nonetheless, the scientific community has continued to overlook some of the longstanding public concerns about genetic engineering, in particular the broad and often covert genetic modification of food products.","89":"","90":"In 1966, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine became the first American medical institution to perform sex reassignment surgeries. This article interrogates the relationship between the emergence of this clinical therapy in the United States and the changing medical understandings of the contemporaneous condition it was intended to address - 'transsexualism.' I argue that, during the mid-to-late twentieth century, therapeutic practices and theories about the etiology of transsexualism were mutually constitutive. On one hand, the clinical development of sex reassignment surgery precipitated a newfound interest in the possible biological, as opposed to psychopathological, underpinnings of transsexualism. At the same time, different theories about etiology were marshaled by both advocates and critics of sex reassignment in their efforts to secure or undercut the medical legitimacy and clinical presence of competing therapeutic practices. Debates surrounding transsexualism's etiology were therefore about much more than the causes of this condition: these etiological conversations also intervened in fundamental debates about the ethics of medical care and the therapeutic identity of different clinical practices (that is, whether sex reassignment and psychotherapy were to be considered primarily symptomatic or curative).","91":"","92":"Ernest Duchesne (1874-1912) completed his thesis on microbial antagonism in 1897 in Lyon. His work lay unknown for fifty years, but on being brought to light led to his being credited with having discovered penicillin prior to Alexander Fleming. The claims surrounding Duchesne are examined here both from the strictly microbiological perspective, and also for what they reveal about how the process of discovery is frequently misconstrued. The combined weight of evidence presented here militates strongly against the possibility that the species of Penicillium that Duchesne worked with produced penicillin.","93":"","94":"In 1924, the model-making company Messmore &amp; Damon, Inc. of New York unleashed their masterpiece: the Amphibious Dinosaurus Brontosaurus, a moving, breathing, roaring animatronic dinosaur, based on displays in the American Museum of Natural History. Over the 1920s and 1930s, this became the focus of an ever-increasing publicity campaign, as Messmore &amp; Damon exhibited prehistoric automata in department stores, the media, and the Chicago World Fair of 1933-34. These displays were hugely popular and widely discussed, drawing from the increasing public appeal of paleontology. Mixing commercial entertainment with invocations of scientific value, Messmore &amp; Damon's prehistoric creations offer a window into the meaning and popularity of the deep time sciences in early-twentieth century America, and the links between science and spectacle in this period.","95":null,"96":"","97":"","98":"Between 2001 and 2009, the area of Naples, South Italy, repeatedly hit the headlines of national and international media due to the waste management crisis that on many occasions filled up the streets of the region with huge piles of waste. What soon emerged as the main bone of contention concerned the connections between the population's health and the presence of dumps on the territory. What the risks for health actually were, who was entitled to assess them, and whether pollution from proximity to dumps caused health problems were all topics that came to the fore during a debate that took place within the Italian epidemiological community, alongside the political and governance crisis.","99":"This paper reviews the cultural meanings, social uses and circulations of arsenic in different legal, medical and popular settings. The focus is on nineteenth-century France. In the first section, I review the advent of the Marsh test for arsenic, which is commonly regarded as a milestone in the history of toxicology. I claim that the high sensitivity of the Marsh test introduced puzzling problems for forensic doctors, the most disturbing one being the so-called 'normal arsenic.' I reconstruct early research on normal arsenic and the ensuing controversies in courts, academies and salons. A report from the French Academy of Science converted normal arsenic from a big discovery to an experimental mistake. In the next section, I study how these disturbing conclusions were perceived by toxicologists all over Europe and how normal arsenic disappeared from view by the middle of the nineteenth century. Finally, I review the return of normal arsenic thanks to Armand Gautier and Gabriel Bertrand, who introduced an innovative research framework and so prompted the displacement of arsenic from criminal toxicology to pharmacology and nutrition science. The last section will also show that the issue of normal arsenic was recaptured in public debates concerning criminal poisoning at the beginning of the twentieth century.

","106":"In the late 1940s and early 1950s engineers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed military facilities across newly independent Libya. This article examines how the local environment - namely the Sahara - shaped how these engineers planned for and carried out their assigned tasks. Though engineers initially hoped to apply experiences from the U.S. to things such as runway construction, they quickly learned that blowing sand, high temperatures and locust invasions could stymie their efforts. Engineers had to rethink what they thought they knew about things as mundane as concrete mixtures and wind-bearing loads. In doing so they created new networks of knowledge about building in hostile environments. Indeed, though long ignored in the scholarly literature on engineering, aviation and U.S. strategic deployments, the environment is everywhere in the documentary record about postwar military construction programs. This article, like the people it considers, takes the sand seriously. In doing so it also illuminates the surprisingly intimate ways that national security meets the everyday. ","107":"In the Origin of Species (1859), Darwin argued that his revolutionary theory of evolution by natural selection represented a significant breakthrough in the understanding of instinctive behaviour. However, many aspects in the development of his thinking on behavioural phenomena indicate that the explanation of this particular organic feature was by no means an easy one, but that it posed an authentic challenge - something that Darwin himself always recognized. This paper explores Darwin's treatment of instincts within his theory of natural selection. Particular attention is given to elucidate how he tackled the difficulties of explaining instincts as evolving mental features. He had to explain and demonstrate its inheritance, variation, and gradual accumulation within populations. The historical and philosophical aspects of his theory are highlighted, as well as his study of the case in which the explanation of instincts represented a 'special difficulty'; that is, the sterile castes of social insects. ","108":"Museum objects have biographies shaped by their material, geographical and cultural origins, their initial intended purpose, and the ways in which they are valued and interpreted by curators and public audiences. Often one object becomes highly symbolic of a particular group even as its presentation over time reflects changing perceptions of the culture as well as the individual object. A Maori hei-tiki - a small but distinctive greenstone pendant - collected by Charles Wilkes on his United States Exploring Expedition in 1840 provides insight into changing museum practices, museum networks of exchange, the impact of professionalizing expertise in ethnology and anthropology since the late nineteenth century, shifting public interests and expectations, and, indeed, the unanticipated ways in which museum objects find their way into exhibition, in this case at the Smithsonian Institution. The material resilience and embedded historicity of the hei-tiki remain as a counterbalance to its versatility as an object useful in multiple stories over nearly two centuries.

Well-known scientists authored them, including Rachel Carson, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gamow, Fred Hoyle, Julian Huxley, and Margaret Mead. A short history of 'the paperback revolution' that began in the 1930s is provided before concentrating on one publishing company based in New York City, the New American Library of World Literature (NAL), which produced Signet and Mentor Books.

By examining the cognitive features of the correspondence principle and comparing it with those of Pauli's exclusion principle, I will show that it did more than simply 'save the phenomena'. The correspondence principle in fact rested on powerful analogies and mental schemas. Pauli's rejection of model-based methods in favor of a phenomenological, rule-based approach was therefore not as disruptive as some historians have indicated. Even at a stage that seems purely phenomenological, historical studies of theoretical development should take into account non-formal, model-based approaches in the form of mental schemas, analogies and images. In fact, Bohr's images and analogies had non-classical components which were able to evoke the idea of exclusion as a prohibition law and as a preliminary mental schema.

His infamous feud with Yale paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, which played out publicly on the front pages of the New York Herald, was one of the worst scandals of nineteenth-century American science. Cope did not fight exclusively with his pen, however. In 1888, for example, he traded blows with his close friend Persifor Frazer over a matter of honor at the entrance of Philadelphia's hallowed Philosophical Hall, just as a meeting of the American Philosophical Society was getting under way. A six-page letter, handwritten by Persifor Frazer and housed in the Frazer Family Papers at the University of Pennsylvania, details the circumstances of their quarrel.

Starting in 1964, Environmental Research Associates, a tiny company in the suburbs of Baltimore, developed the key innovations in an obscure research project funded by NASA's Langley Research Center. The new Houston center dismissed it until a mid-1966 EVA crisis, after which it rapidly took over. In parallel, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center developed many of the same techniques, as did many large aerospace corporations, yet the long-run technological impact of corporate activity was near zero. Because ERA and Marshall's pioneering activities led to the two long-running NASA training centers at Houston and Huntsville, those two organizations deserve primary credit for the construction of the neutral buoyancy technological system.

By reporting on these advanced medico-scientific practices, the chroniclers appear to be confirming the superiority of the conquistadors over the natives and justifying the conquest. However, they problematize this supposed superiority by framing the events in complex scenarios that resound of some of the controversies surrounding dissection in the period. This contradictory treatment of dissection can be interpreted as a manifestation of the conquistadors' anxiety around being physically identical to the natives except for a fragile, skin-deep veneer of civilized behaviour. ","119":"Continuing historical narratives of the early twentieth century nexus of conservationism, eugenics, and nativism (exemplified by Madison Grant), this paper traces the history of the contemporary US anti-immigration movement's roots in environmentalism and global population control activism, through an exploration of the thoughts and activities of the activist, John Tanton, who has been called \"the most influential unknown man in America.\" We explore the \"neo-Malthusian\" ideas that sparked a seminal moment for population control advocacy in the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading to the creation of Zero Population Growth (ZPG). After rising to the presidency of ZPG, Tanton, and ZPG spun off the Federation for American Immigration Reform. After leaving ZPG's leadership, Tanton created additional anti-immigration advocacy groups and built up connections with existing organizations such as the Pioneer Fund. We trace Tanton's increasingly radical conservative network of anti-immigration advocates, conservationists, and population control activists to the present day. Tanton's archived papers illustrate, among other things, his interactions with collaborators such as ecologist Garrett Hardin (author of the famous \"Tragedy of the Commons\") and his documented interest in reviving eugenics. We contend that this history of Tanton's network provides key insights into understanding how there came to be an overlap between the ideologies and activist communities of immigration restrictionism, population control, conservationism and eugenics.

The basic assumption was that overcoming God's curse on Adam had been possible only through sustained hard work - industry in the early Victorian sense - and that this imperative work ethic had always been God's intention for mankind. In elaborating the details, preachers combined the British tradition of natural theology with the Scottish Enlightenment's progressive science of man to paint a picture of the slow recovery of man from the Fall through his own industry. This was the very story of civilization itself, with God the driving force. The celebrants were quite clear that it was divine providence that had ordained the greatness of Great Britain. ","124":"The invention and spread of the mechanical clock is a complex and multifaceted historical phenomenon. Some of these facets, such as its social impact, have been widely studied, but their scientific dimensions have often been dismissed. The mechanical clock was probably born as a scientific instrument for driving a model of the universe, and not only natural philosophers but also kings, nobles and other members of the social elites showed an interest in clocks as scientific instruments. Public clocks later spread a new way of telling time based on equal hours, laying the foundations for changes in time consciousness that would accelerate scientific thinking. ","125":"This article examines the relationship between theory and practice in nineteenth century English public health disinfection practice. Disinfection undertaken by local authorities and practised on objects, spaces and people became an increasingly common public health practice in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and was part of a newly developed public health system of 'stamping out' disease as described by Hardy. Despite disinfection's key role in public health policy, it has thus far not received significant investigation or historiographical attending. This article explores the development of disinfection policy at local level, highlighting that despite commentators assumptions that increasingly exacting standards of disinfection required professional oversight rather than that of the 'amateur' public, there was a significant gap between laboratory based knowledge and evidence derived from practical experience. Laboratory conditions could not replicate those found in day-to-day disinfection, and there were myriad debates about how to create a mutually understandable scientific standard for testing. Despite increasing efforts to bring local disinfection in line with new ideas promulgated by central government and disinfection researchers, the mismatches between the two meant that there was greater divergence. This tension lay at the heart of the changes in disinfection theory and practice in the second half of the nineteenth century, and illustrate the complexities of the impact of germ theory on public health policy. ","126":"Encephalitis lethargica (EL) was an epidemic that spread throughout Europe and North America during the 1920s. Although it could affect both children and adults alike, there were a strange series of chronic symptoms that exclusively affected its younger victims: behavioural disorders which could include criminal propensities. In Britain, which had passed the Mental Deficiency Act in 1913, the concept of mental deficiency was well understood when EL appeared. However, EL defied some of the basic precepts of mental deficiency to such an extent that amendments were made to the Mental Deficiency Act in 1927. I examine how clinicians approached the sequelae of EL in children during the 1920s, and how their work and the social problem that these children posed eventually led to changes in the legal definition of mental deficiency. EL serves as an example of how diseases are not only framed by the society they emerge in, but can also help to frame and change existing concepts within that same society.

Three years later he applied this mapping idea to genera of birds of prey and songbirds, creating a large wall chart that he displayed to colleagues but never published. Both of his diagrams featured a scale of degrees of affinity. The meaning of taxonomic affinity was something Darwin thought about deeply. Details in the chart undermine Strickland's claim that his method was purely inductive. ","128":"","129":"The Transformist Revolution was a long intellectual quest that has expanded from the 18th century to today. One area of inquiry after another has confronted the necessity of recasting its object of study under an evolutionary view: human history, geology, biology, astronomy, etc. No single scholar fully managed to make the transition from a static worldview to an evolutionary one during his or her own lifetime; Charles Darwin is no exception. Many versions of evolutionism were proposed during this revolution, versions offering all sorts of compromises between old and new views. Not sufficiently acknowledged in the historiography is the profoundness of Darwin's debts towards the old static view. As a dual child of the Scientific Revolution and natural theology, Darwin inherited key concepts such as stability, completeness, timelessness, unity, permanence, and uniformity. Darwin took these concepts into consideration while erecting his theory of biological evolution. Unsurprisingly, this theory was ill-equipped to embrace the directionality, historicity, and novelty that came along with a new evolutionary world. This paper analyses a fundamental idea at the heart of Darwin's Origins of Species (1859) inherited from a static, stable, and machine-like conception of the world: the notion of a fully constituted world. Although in principle antithetical to the very idea of evolution itself, Darwin found a way to 'loosen up' this notion so as to retain it in a way that allows for some kind of evolutionary change. ","130":"In the first part of this paper, I will show that although Darwin's geological works only covered the first years of his scientific career, these played a non-negligible role in the earth sciences of the mid-nineteenth century. His intellectual proximity with Charles Lyell often made him his disciple. This is indeed the case with respect to debates over 'gradual' soil movements and 'catastrophic' soil movements, and for 'steady-state' cycles as opposed to 'directionalistic' ones. This being said, it is also true that in South America Darwin saw geological processes which were incompatible with Lyell's explanations. It must therefore be recognized that Darwin held a middle-of-the-road position between uniformitarianism (Lyell) and catastrophism (Humbolt and von Buch), at least as far as some geological questions were concerned. In the second part of the paper, debates on geological issues during Darwin's active years will be put in the methodological context of the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. ","131":"","132":"The notions of 'the Darwinian revolution' and of 'the scientific Revolution' are no longer unproblematic; so this paper does not construe its task as relating these two items to each other. There can be big-picture and long-run history even when that task is declined. Such history has to be done pluralistically. Relating Darwin's science to Newton's science is one kind of historiographical challenge; relating Darwin's science to seventeenth-century finance capitalism is another kind. Relating Darwin's science to long-run traditions and transitions is a different kind of task from relating his science to the immediate short-run contexts. ","133":"Was there a Darwinian Revolution and was it but part of the Scientific Revolution? Before Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962, most people thought that there was a Darwinian Revolution, that it was in some sense connected to the Scientific Revolution, but that neither question nor answer was terribly interesting. Then revolutions in science became a matter of intense debate, not so much about their very existence but about their nature. Was there a switch in world-views? Did the facts change? What was the importance of social groups? And so forth. Recently however some students of the history of science have started to argue that the very questions are misconceived and that there cannot have been a Darwinian Revolution and its relationship to the Scientific Revolution is imaginary because there are no such revolutions in science! This paper takes a sympathetic look at these issues, concluding that there is still life in the revolution-in-science issue, that Kuhn's book was seminal and still has things of importance to say, but that matters are more complex and more interesting than we thought back then.

Beginning the century as an intellectual hero, he soon became a virtual footnote as experimental approaches to evolution began to develop. As the Modern Synthesis developed his reputation began to rise again until eventually he was identified as a founding father of the Modern Synthesis itself. In the meantime, developmental approaches to evolution began to challenge certain aspects of the Modern Synthesis. Synthesis authors attempted to refute the relevance of development by methodological arguments, some of them indirectly credited to Darwin. By the end of the century, molecular genetics had given new life to development approaches to evolution, now called evo devo. This must be seen as a refutation of the aforesaid methodological arguments of the Modern Synthesis advocates. By the way, we can also see now how the historiography that credited Darwin with the Synthesis was in error. In conclusion, one more historical revision is suggested. ","138":"For Victorian men of science, the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century represented a moral awakening. Great theoretical triumphs of inductive science flowed directly from a philosophical spirit that embraced the virtues of self-discipline, courage, patience and humility. Isaac Newton exemplified this union of moral and intellectual excellence. This, at least, was the story crafted by scientific leaders like David Brewster, Thomas Chalmers, John Herschel, Adam Sedgwick and William Whewell. Not everyone accepted this reading of history. Evangelicals who decried the 'materialism' of mainstream science assigned a different meaning to Newton's legacy on behalf of their 'scriptural' alternative. High-church critics of science like John Henry Newman, on the other hand, denied that Newton's secular achievements carried any moral significance at all. These debates over Newtonian standards of philosophical behavior had a decisive influence on Charles Darwin as he developed his theory of evolution by natural selection. ","139":"Common to both the scientific and Darwinian revolutions were discussions challenging the distinction between art and nature. Was art a part of nature? Could art be used as a model for nature? This intellectual congruence, however, is more than just nominal. Charles Darwin and Asa Gray, for example, were well-aware of the 17th century debates which preceded them through the works of such revered English writers as William Shakespeare and Thomas Browne. Furthermore, they used their understandings of these debates to inform and express their own thinking about the relation between artificial and natural selection. ","140":"","141":"In the late Victorian Era, a group of British physicists devoted their time to interpreting and extending the work of James Clerk Maxwell. There has been considerable discussion about the ways in which these \"Maxwellian\" physicists used mechanical models by in the for research purposes; less attention has been paid to the relevance of their mechanical models for pedagogical purposes. Drawing from educational research literature, I begin from the premise that understanding a scientist's self-identity in its historical context is crucial to understanding how she or he enacts particular pedagogical approaches. I aim to extend Bruce Hunt's seminal work on the Maxwellians by providing a pedagogical analysis of one of Sir Oliver Lodge's lectures. In so doing, I claim that Lodge drew on his identity as a Maxwellian as an organizing framework for his lecture and that he attempted to engage his audience in Maxwellian thought by exposing them to many mechanical models. I conclude that Lodge's self-concept as a teacher and his apparent broad appeal as a public educationist were deeply embedded in his life history as a member of the Maxwellians. Sir Oliver Lodge's identities as a Maxwellian and a pedagogue are inextricably linked.

(The 1908 Flyer was built by the brothers in response to a 1907 requirements specification for a 2-place aircraft capable of flying at 40 mph and able to be broken down and transported in a horse-drawn wagon. Technically, since it crashed during its demonstration program and was not formally delivered to the Army, it never became Army property. But the trials had been so impressive that the Army ordered a second, delivered in 1909.) Just six years later, Europe erupted in a general war. Often portrayed as a sideshow to the war on land and sea, the air war heralded the advent of mechanized warfare, the airplane being one of four great technological advances--the submarine, the tank, and radio communication--that, together, revolutionized military affairs. Aircraft reconnaissance influenced the conduct of military operations from the war's earliest days, and airborne observers routinely governed the fall of artillery barrages, crucially important in an artillery-dominant war.","146":"The First World War was a turning point in the cultural history of death and bereavement in Australia. The mass deaths of some 60,000 soldiers overseas led to communal rituals of mourning for the war dead and minimal public expressions of private grief. The mass slaughter of so many young men and the interminable grief of so many families devalued the deaths of civilians at home and helped to create a new cultural model of suppressed and privatised grieving which deeply constrained the next two generations. Emotional and expressive grieving became less common, mourning ritual was minimised and sorrow became a private matter. ","147":"During the First World War soldiers suffered from a wide range of debilitating nervous complaints as a result of the stresses and strains of modern warfare. These complaints--widely known as shell shock--were the subject of much medical-military debate during the war and became emblematic of the war and its sufferings afterwards. One hundred years after the war the diagnosis of PTSD has not resolved the issues initially raised by First World War shell shock. The stigma of mental illness remains strong and it is still difficult to commemorate and remember the mental wounds of war in a culture which tend to glory or glamorise military heroes.","148":"Public perceptions of the work of nurses and VAD-volunteers in the First World War have been heavily influenced by a small number of VAD-writings.

In this centenary year of the First World War's opening months, the paper also explores the ways in which the British mass-media--notably the BBC--have chosen to cling to a romantic image of the untrained nurse, whilst at the same time acknowledging the significance of trained, professional nursing.","149":"Yale science professor Denison Olmsted used crowdsourcing to gather observations from across the United States of the unexpected deluge of meteors on 13 November 1833--more than 72,000\/h. He used these observations (and newspaper accounts and correspondence from scientists) to make a commendably accurate interpretation of the meteor storm, overturning 2100 years of erroneous teachings about shooting stars and establishing meteor science as a new branch of astronomy. Olmsted's success was substantially based on his use of newspapers and their practice of news pooling to solicit observations from throughout the country by lay and expert observers professionally unaffiliated with Yale College and him. In today's parlance, Olmsted was a remarkably successful early practitioner of scientific crowdsourcing, also known as citizen science. He may have been the first to use mass media for crowdsourcing in science. He pioneered many of the citizen-science crowdsourcing practices that are still in use today: an open call for citizen participation, a clearly defined task, a large geographical distribution for gathering data and a rapid response to opportunistic events. Olmsted's achievement is not just that he used crowdsourcing in 1833 but that crowdsourcing helped him to advance science significantly.","150":"","151":"","152":"Previous research on the origins of double star astronomy in the early nineteenth century emphasized the role mathematical methods and instrumentation played in motivating early observations of these objects. The work of the British astronomer John Herschel, however, shows that questions regarding the physical nature of double stars were also important. In particular, an analysis of John Herschel's early work on double stars illustrates the way in which speculations regarding these objects were shaped by assumptions of the properties of stars themselves. For Herschel, a major consideration in double star astronomy was distinguishing between types of double stars. Optical doubles were useful in determining parallax while binary doubles were not. In practice, classification of a specific double star pair into one of these categories was based on the assumption that stars were of approximately the same luminosity and thus differences in relative brightness between stars were caused by difference in distances. Such assumptions, though ultimately abandoned, would lead Herschel in the 1830s to advance the possibility that the dim companion stars in certain double star pairs were not stars at all but in fact planets.

The trouble lay not in their choice of tests but in their performance measures for bombardiering, a difficulty that came to be known as 'the problem of the criterion.' This episode in the history of military mental testing exemplifies the challenges faced by psychologists at the moment they were poised to gain the support of the armed services, and highlights how these new hazards shaped postwar military psychology. ","156":"Quinine, a naturally occurring alkaloid from the Cinchona tree, was one of the first drugs produced and sold by a global pharmaceutical industry during the nineteenth century. Factories in Europe and North America dominated the manufacturing industry, and between 1890 and 1940, Cinchona plantations on Java supplied most of the bark for the quinine pharmaceutical business. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Dutch colonial state kept a hands-off approach to the Cinchona enterprises, in keeping with its liberal orientation. But the persistent low-price for bark, which led to the near ruin of the Cinchona planters, eventually pushed the colonial state to actively protect the Cinchona plantations. Colonial officials sought to stabilize the colonial Cinchona export-business by encouraging the integration of the quinine industry on a global scale. Most important was the colonial state's sponsorship in 1913 of the Quinine Agreement, establishing a set price for Cinchona bark, which created the world's first pharmaceutical cartel. In the interwar period, an alliance of Dutch government officials, planters, scientists, doctors and drug-makers, working in both the motherland and the colony, actively promoted the expansion of quinine consumption, as well as the merit of the Quinine Agreement, which they argued supplied guaranteed a steady supply of quinine, all for the wellbeing of global humanity.","157":"In 1926, Frederic Wood Jones, professor of Anatomy at the University of Adelaide and a leading figure in the British anatomical world, took a Rockefeller Foundation funded trip to the United States in order to inspect anatomy programmes and medical museums and to meet leading figures in the anatomical and anthropological world. His later reflections paint a picture of a discipline in transition. Physical anthropology and gross anatomy were coming to a crisis point in the United States, increasingly displaced by research in histology, embryology and radiological anatomy. Meanwhile, in Britain and its colonial outposts, anatomists such as Wood Jones were attempting to re-invigorate the discipline in the field, studying biological specimens as functional and active agents in their particular milieus, but with human dissection at the core. Thus, an examination of this trip allows us to see how the interaction between two traditions in anatomy informed the process of the development of human biology in this critical period.

This paper explores the history of a concept that has developed in parallel with advances in biology and supports novel and powerful heuristic biological research in the 21st century. From a structural interpretation (the genome as the haploid number of chromosomes), it has changed to keep pace with technological progress and new interpretations of the material of heredity. In the first place, the 'genome' was extended to include all the material in the nucleus, then the sum of all genes, and (with the discovery of the structure of DNA) the sum of the nucleotide base sequences. In the early 21st century, it has become a much more complex and central concept that has spawned the growing field of studies referred to as the 'omics'.

In order to make wise use of existing resources, researchers now find themselves committed to carrying out this vision with its accompanying assumptions. By clarifying the specific characteristics of model organism work, we aim to provide a framework to assess how much funding should be allocated to such research. On the one hand, it is imperative to exploit the resources and knowledge accumulated using these models to study more diverse groups of organisms.

These new understandings contributed to the \"renaissance\" GR experienced starting in the late 1950s.

Research in biology exhibits different historical trajectories and organisation of collaboration in field and laboratory - differences still visible in contemporary collaborations such as the Census of Marine Life and the Human Genome Project. We employ these case studies as strategic exemplars, supplemented with existing research on collaboration in biology, to expose the different motives, organisational forms and social dynamics underpinning contemporary large-scale collaborations in biology and their relations to historical patterns of collaboration in the life sciences.

","172":"This paper examines codes of representation in nineteenth century engineering in Britain in relation to broader visual culture. While engineering was promoted as a rational public enterprise through techniques of spectacular display, engineers who aimed to be taken seriously in the intellectual hierarchies of science had to negotiate suitable techniques for making and using images. These difficulties can be examined in the visual practices that mark the career of engineer David Kirkaldy. Beginning as a bravura naval draughtsman, Kirkaldy later negotiated his status as a serious experimenter in material testing science, changing his style of representation that at first sight seems to be in line with the 'objective' strategy in science of getting nature to represent herself. And although Kirkaldy maintained a range of visual styles to communicate with different audiences, making rhetorical use of several technologies of inscription, from hand drawing to photography, nevertheless, his work does in fact demonstrate new uses of the concept of objectivity in representation when up against the practices of engineering. While these might seem merely pragmatic in comparison to the ethical weight given to the discourse of objective representation in science, in the messy world of collapsing bridges and law suits, virtuous engineers had to develop various forms of visual knowledge as practical science. This was not 'applied science' but a differentiated form of enquiry whose complexities hold as much interest as the better known visual cultures of late nineteenth century science or art. ","173":"","174":"Since its inception in 1831, the discussion of political and religious topics had been excluded from the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) - it was a 'neutral' body. This strategy was designed to both unite men of science with differing religious views, and prevent the Association from becoming embroiled in theological disputes. Although not always successful, the dedication to neutrality remained throughout the BAAS's history and was an important organising principle. This paper investigates how the separation of scientific and religious knowledge played out in practice by examining the speech of William Henry Dallinger, the prominent English microscopical researcher and Methodist preacher. In 1884 Dallinger travelled to Montreal, Canada, to part in the BAAS's fifty-fourth meeting. While in the city he delivered three addresses: a guest lecture to the Association, a presentation to a local theological College and a sermon at Montreal's largest Methodist church. To the Association Dallinger presented his science without any religious commitments, yet in these other venues, and away from the Association's strictures on speech, he presented science and religion as harmonious and inexorably tied. This paper argues that where Dallinger spoke made a difference to what he said, and underlines the value of thinking 'geographically' about encounters between science and religion.","175":"Surveys of Chinese students since the 1980s report that less than 1% are left-handed. This is an extraordinarily low number given the generally accepted view that between 10 and 12% of humans are left-handed. Are there actually very few left-handers in China and, if so, why? A number of sometimes overlapping reasons have shaped Chinese attitudes toward left-handedness. Some of these reflect the transcendent human reactions to biological laterality. Others have been shaped by Chinese historical and cultural experience. What is true in China can be identified in other societies: attitudes and practices toward left-handers have been and continue to be shaped by over-determined forces, which at the same time transcend specific cultures, while they respond to historical and cultural pressures. Like the Chinese, many North and East African peoples attempt to 'cure' left-handedness by a combination of restraints and severe punishments. Religion has often reinforced these practices. In China, we can see how a combination of traditional values and practical considerations seems to have merged to reduce both the actual and reported prevalence of left-handedness. When we add in the population of India, and much of the remaining Islamic world, we can conclude that for two-thirds of the world's population, being born left-handed exposes one to discrimination and stigma.","176":"In the eighteenth century, a new genre of periodical literature appeared from Mexico City's presses that focused on disseminating scientific and medical knowledge to the colonial public.

It draws our attention to the important role of popularizers of science who worked in these museums and exhibitions.

By exploring what was reported we see how, instead of questioning the roots of rural illness, poverty, and the hunger that they witnessed, young doctors often unwittingly reinforced urban prejudices and concerns that blamed indigenous Mexicans for their own poverty and diseased status. Because sanitary reports were authored by medical students, they were often perceived as 'scientific' evidence of the living conditions and unhealthy choices of rural Mexicans. The author argues that as in the case of travel narratives, medical students' written assessments influenced how the rest of society came to understand rural Mexico.","182":"In the late nineteenth century, Mexican scientists became fixated on pelvic structure as an indicator of racial difference and hereditary worth. Forty years later, in his 1931 dissertation, medical student Gustavo Aldolfo Trangay proposed the implementation of a eugenic sterilization campaign in Mexico.

Trangay reasoned that his patients were unfit for motherhood, and he claimed that their small pelvic cavities were a sign of biological inferiority. His focus on anatomical measurements--and especially pelvic measurements--was not novel in Mexico, but his work shows how doctors used nineteenth century racial science to rationalize eugenic sterilization.","183":"After the revolutionary conflicts of the 1910s, the Mexican state sought to bring peace to the country's obstreperous, rebellious and often downright unknown rural provinces through the establishment of a new social pact.

Success depended on multiple regional factors and even healthcare, often presented as a neutral, politically uncharged benefit, faced ample opposition.

While national policymakers and state officials designed plans to improve agricultural production, promote industrialization, utilize the area's natural resources, and expand communication channels, health workers established unprecedented relationships with indigenous community members by introducing the Commission's projects in culturally relevant ways. They used their on-the-ground experiences to learn local languages, customs, and beliefs, and incorporated these factors into their health education and disease treatment campaigns. The result serves as an example of short-term cooperative relationships between healthcare workers and indigenous groups that not only reduced the major health risks in the area, but also paved the way for collective economic development.","185":"This article introduces the reader to the life and work of Elisabeth Goldschmidt, the founding mother of the field of genetics in Israel. It concurrently strives to uncover the roots and development of genetics in Israel, tracing the crucial transition from classical Drosophila genetics to human genetics and the shift from a Germanic tradition of scientific research to an American one. Goldschmidt's personal biography is inextricably linked to the early stages of genetic research in Israel. The narrative of her life could have been a heroic and inspiring account of a female scientist who 'had it all', had its end been less tragic. Nevertheless, her life was rich, including a path of achievement and trail-blazing coupled with the joy and satisfaction she gleaned from her scientific work.","186":"Drawing upon archival and published sources, 'Like a Keen North Wind,' suggests that Charles Elton's book-The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants-served to galvanize Rachel Carson's ideas while she was writing Silent Spring. Carson had already amassed numerous cases of the poisoning of the environment and wildlife as well as humans. Elton's book helped Carson to draw connections between the various kinds of exposures. Yet, it was Carson's genius to animate Silent Spring with vivid examples that captivated her readers and convinced them to question indiscriminate use of pesticides. Moreover, Carson adroitly bridged the growing divide between scientists and the public.","187":"Little doubt remains about the influence of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in changing the consciousness of not just Americans, but citizens around the world, regarding the relationship between human beings and the natural world. Less has been done about the specific ways Carson's book inspired individual activists to continue challenging pesticide policy within the United States in the decades after the book's publication. The stories of three western women fighting the use of Agent Orange herbicides - the phenoxy herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T - illustrate the influence and mixed success of environmental activism after Silent Spring.","188":"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring generated a firestorm of controversy following its publication in 1962. While numerous scholars have relied on written sources to gage how industry representatives, scientists, government officials, and the public responded to this bestselling book, they have paid much less attention to how visual sources might further our understanding of the context in which Carson wrote, the message she sought to convey, and the impact of her work. This article analyzes sixteen editorial cartoons that appeared in the wake of Carson's book, images that reveal an emerging set of shared understandings about how modern technology presented potential dangers to both humans and the natural world. Using culturally resonant words and images, the cartoonists who editorialized about Carson and her book demonstrate the extent to which her frightening vision of bodily and ecological vulnerability began to permeate society, spawning a counternarrative to the still dominant discourse that linked technological progress, economic development, and the common good. These cartoons thus provide a useful window onto the reception of Silent Spring, the times in which it was published, and the birth of the modern environmental movement.","189":"The controversial pesticide DDT arose out of a number of practical and conceptual developments in science and industry during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Here we trace its story back to experiments involving the industrial by-product coal tar, proceed to the development of modern organic chemistry and the establishment of an advanced dye industry, and go on to chart the attempt to identify and synthesize chemicals capable of killing the insects involved in human and crop diseases. This paper argues that work on the chemistry of coal tar played a significant role in the history of DDT because it helped bring about the scientific ideas and the practical objectives that led chemists to embark on the search for pesticides. It concludes by examining the Swiss-German DDT production industry in the early 1940s and the subsequent condemnation of DDT by an environmental movement epitomized by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.","190":"This article explores the evolution of anti-Carson rhetoric. It argues that this rhetoric has evolved significantly over the past fifty years. Early critics of Silent Spring were primarily concerned with defending their vision of science from what they perceived as the threat embodied in Carson's ecological perspective. By the early twenty-first century, her main detractors were now neoliberal advocates of unfettered markets, who perceived in Carson a major reason for what they saw as related evils: environmentalism and an expanded state. These two sets of adversaries used distinct rhetorical strategies, corresponding to their different interests as well as to changing historical context. Across both eras, however, the perceived utility of Carson as an anti-heroine persisted.","191":"This paper examines how pesticides and their technologies were sold to farmers and pilots throughout the midtwentieth century. It principally considers how marketing rhetoric and advertisement strategies used by chemical companies and aerial spraying firms influenced the practices and perspectives of farm producers in the Great Plains. In order to convince landowners and agricultural leaders to buy their pesticides, chemical companies generated advertisements that championed local crop health, mixture accuracy, livestock safety and a chemical-farming 'way of life' that kept fields healthy and productive. Combining notions of safety, accuracy and professionalism with pest eradication messages reinforced the standards that landowners, pilots and agriculturalists would hold regarding toxicity and risk when spraying their fields. As the politics of health changed in the aftermath of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, these companies and aerial spraying outfits responded by keeping to a vision of agricultural health that required poisons for protection through technological accuracy.","192":"As Silent Spring passed the half-century mark, historians have continued to reflect on its significance. For this issue of Endeavour, we drew together six articles that explore a few of the many legacies of this remarkable book. Given the impressive scope and breadth of the papers in this issue, it is clear that Silent Spring, and the shock waves surrounding its publication, continue to provide rich fodder for historical analysis.","193":"","194":"","195":"","196":"","197":"In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite, initiating its space exploration programs. Throughout the rest of the twentieth century, the development of these space programs received special attention from Soviet Union authorities. Scientists from the former Soviet Republics, including Lithuania, participated in these programs. From 1971 to 1990, Lithuanians designed more than 20 experiments on higher plant species during space flight. Some of these experiments had never before been attempted and, therefore, made scientific history. However, the formation and development of space plant biology research in Lithuania or its origins, context of formation, and placement in a worldwide context have not been explored from a historical standpoint. By investigating these topics, this paper seeks to construct an image of the development of a very specific field of science in a small former Soviet republic.","198":"","199":null,"200":"In 1955, a paradigm shift in the conception of sex is said to have taken place, when psychologist John Money at Johns Hopkins's Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic argued that 'hermaphroditic' children could be assigned a sex contradictory to their biological sex. Rather than being born male or female, he claimed, these children learned to be boys or girls. Money was subsequently credited the invention of the term gender role. However, Money only confirmed a practice that was established at the clinic several years before his intervention. The clinic's director Lawson Wilkins (1894-1963) had already recommended that certain children, virilized by congenital adrenal hyperplasia, should be raised in the male sex, even though they were by all medical standards of the time female. What mattered for him was assigning the sex that seemed 'better' for these children. What constituted the 'better sex' was contingent on the child's psyche and habitus, social expectations, and on the range of medical and surgical interventions available at the time.","201":"The well known naturalist, Richard Owen, had a career long engagement with monstrous creatures. In the 1830s he famously christened large fossil reptiles, Dinosauria. He investigated fossil marine reptiles as well as the giant moa. He also looked into the sea-serpents and sea monsters then drawing wide public attention. He actively collected letters and analyzed correspondence on the topic, consulted with the admiralty on reports of Royal Navy encounters and sightings, and commented in the public press. He concluded that such reports were based upon misidentifications of whales and other large marine mammals, and not run-ins with mythological creatures. His work on the sea-serpent shows that rather than discount the idea out of hand, a number of high profile naturalists were intrigued by monsters and attempted to understand what they were. His work is key to understanding the skepticism over monsters held by modern mainstream science. This skepticism opened the field to later amateur investigators.","202":"The field of paleoanthropology arose out of a strange and unacknowledged early phase of development prior to about the 1930s. It is often assumed that a key pillar of the discipline, the unity of humankind--the notion that humans are clearly separated phylogenetically (genealogically) from other non-human primates--was widely accepted from the inception of paleoanthropology around 1860. However, a final consensus on this fundamental question only appeared later on in the 20th century. This paper will focus on two key areas of disagreement, which reveal the unsettled state of this question during this early period: the question of uncertainty with respect to the number, identity and boundary of primate species (including humans) which prevailed in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries; and the matter of uncertainty with respect to the nature of the phylogenetic relationships among the various human populations and the other primate species which prevailed between 1864 and 1931. Consideration of these matters reveals that the modern research structure that paleoanthropologists take for granted today is much more recent than believed.","203":"What does it look like to be the carrier of a genetic disease? Carrier status may be determined through the visual analysis of both genotypic and phenotypic evidence. Over the past 70 years, clinical geneticists have depended upon multiple strategies for identifying disease carriers within a family. This has included pedigree analysis, which was based upon clinical observations of individual family members and, in recent decades, cytogenetic and molecular methods. Newer techniques have offered novel opportunities to actually see the suspected etiological markers of certain genetic diseases, such as Fragile X syndrome. The visualization of these markers has both clarified and confused previously observed inheritance patterns, in some cases leading to the development of newly distinct diagnostic categories. As a result, what it means to be affected by, or the carrier of, a genetic disease has continuously evolved.","204":"There is a long history of concern in Britain for how animals are treated. Until the 1960s, these concerns were expressed largely in terms of cruelty or suffering, which was prevented through various acts of Parliament. Over the period 1964-71, amidst public debates about intensive farming, a new discourse of animal welfare emerged. To understand what welfare meant and how it became established as a term, a concept and a target of government regulation, it is necessary to examine farming politics and practices, the existing tradition of animal protection and attempts to rethink the nature of animal suffering.","205":"Despite efforts to lay out the Great Exhibition in a rational arrangement, it was so vast and variegated and overwhelming in its single 18-acre building that it was literally indescribable. Robert Hunt in his Synopsis argued that every visitor needed to find a thread - any thread - through the labyrinth; but this proved elusive, even for professional journalists, who must overall be judged to have failed. With description impossible, journalists tried other strategies, notably epistolary form, and also fiction, which excused the writer from providing any more than a few personal impressions. The legacy of the Exhibition is ambiguous: judged at the time an overwhelming success, it proved to be all too easily forgettable and ephemeral.","206":"After the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Francisco Franco's emphasis on dam building became so intense that it is still today associated with his dictatorial rule. Rather than being purely a personal obsession, however, this intensive period of reservoir construction was the result of the influential political role played by engineers from the early years of the regime. During the years 1946-1961 some of these engineers undertook the 'total transformation' of the Noguera Ribagorzana river basin in the Catalonian Pyrenees. But this explicitly 'totalitarian' project encountered important limitations posed both by competing state agencies and by the basin's geology. Analysing the efforts of these engineers allows for new understandings of the Francoist regime and of the place of science, technology, and the landscape within it.","207":"Everybody thinks they know what science is, but pinning down a definite time and place for its origins is more problematic.","208":"","209":"One hundred years ago, teams led by Roald Amundsen and Robert Scott may have been heading in the same direction but they were poles apart in the way they sought their goals. Amundsen led a five-person team of expert Nordic skiers and dog-sledders with a single goal: getting to the South Pole first. He planned and executed the effort brilliantly. Scott, in contrast, led a complex and multi-faceted Antarctic expedition with 33 explorers and scientists, many of whom were focused on ambitious and often taxing scientific research projects that had nothing whatsoever to do with reaching the Pole. Although Scott failed to reach the South Pole first and died with four men on the return trip, his expedition made significant contributions to Antarctic science. Indeed, at least some of Scott's failure to reach the Pole first and the subsequent death of his polar party on the return trip can be attributed to burden of trying to do too much and not focusing on reaching the pole.","210":"Psychiatrists working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the late-1950s feared the worst of the men they examined to be America's first astronauts: that they would be impulsive, suicidal, sexually aberrant thrill-seekers. The examiners, though, were surprised - and a little disappointed - when tests revealed the would-be astronauts to be sane, poised professionals able to absorb extraordinary stresses. A Space Age malady with no incidence among human populations, 'space madness' is the stuff of Hollywood: a cultural manifestation of popular fears of a lonely, dehumanizing, and claustrophobic future among the stars.","211":"","212":"Life expectancy and chronic disease rates both rose dramatically in the United States during the first third of the twentieth century. As a result of this concurrence, Americans in this era increasingly thought about things they could do to extend their own lives, especially eating less, exercising more, and limiting stress, all factors thought to reduce chronic disease. New recognition of the correlation between daily physical habits and long lives made longevity look like a sign of virtue. At the same time, amidst discussions about the relationship between individual longevity and national vitality, this correlation also contributed to Americans' moralization of diet, exercise, and emotional self-control.","213":"Recent historical research reveals a much greater role than previously assumed for science in the polar activities of Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen. Science-based polar exploration was what first linked these two men; Amundsen's subsequent turn to sport and sensation dampened their relationship. These insights and other new perspectives about heroic period of polar exploration are being transformed by the author into a drama for stage that will have its world premier in Norway in December 2011. The play attempts to use imaginatively the art and craft of theatre to diffuse insight from historical scholarship.","214":"A comparative study of Japanese and Japanese-American survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 suggests that there is much to be gained by looking at the history of the Bomb as a cross-cultural history. Issues of science and gender in survivors' experiences and memories illuminate three key features of the trans-Pacific history: a Japanese female author's literary responses to the Bomb, the Japan-U.S. relationship after the war that shaped Japan's antinuclear movement, and Japanese-American survivors' effort to gain governmental recognition and medical care in the U.S. within the context of the Asian American movement. Using variety of sources--literature, popular political discourse, congressional hearings, and oral histories--this article shows the volatile diffusion of political and cultural ideas revealed by a trans-Pacific perspective.","215":"","216":"","217":"This article argues for material histories of food. In recent decades food historians have tended to emphasize the cultural factors in consumption, in addition to the already well-established social, political and economic perspectives, but what is still missing is the stuff in foodstuffs. With reference in particular to milk and wine, the suggestion here is that physical and chemical composition is a major influence in what we might call the biographies of particular items of food and drink. Product characteristics are rarely static for long and today's mass-produced bread is different from that of the past, but then so are the flour, the yeast, and the even the butter that is spread on it. Adulteration was a particularly interesting aspect of composition in the nineteenth century and was the key to the emergence of two different traditions of understanding and valuing food quality.","218":"This study explores the history of horseflesh consumption in modern Britain and France. It examines why horsemeat became relatively popular in France, but not Britain. These reasons include the active role of scientists, philanthropists, journalists and butchers. These figures did not actively promote horsemeat in Britain. These factors are as important as cultural and economic ones in explaining dietary transformation.","219":"In 1911-1912 Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott led rival parties in a race to the geographic South Pole. While both parties reached the Pole--Amundsen first--Scott's men died on the return journey. Amundsen became a Norwegian icon through his record-setting travels; Scott became a symbol of courage and devotion to science. The memory of each was invoked at various points during the twentieth century in the context of contemporary Antarctic events. Scott's status as a scientific figure was central to the Scott Polar Research Institute, while Amundsen's lack of scientific legacy became a way for British polar explorers to differentiate themselves from Norwegian contemporaries during the interwar years. After 1945 Scott and Amundsen were again invoked as exemplars of national polar achievement, even as the rise of large-scale science on the continent overshadowed past British and Norwegian achievements. In the present Amundsen and Scott remain wedded to particular values, focused respectively on national achievement and sacrifice in the name of science, while their race has become secondary.","220":"","221":"In the late 1940s, Florence Sabin, a retired professor of medicine, returned to her home in Colorado to launch a massive public health campaign. Seeing \"filthy milk\" as an important vector of disease, she struggled not just pasteurized milk, but a pasteurized state government that was capable of regulating the milk industry. In the process, she brought managerialism into public health by fighting against the political machines and introducing Robert McNamara's systems analysis into government for the first time. Sabin's innovation, which united business, government and public health in new ways, transformed the way that public health is managed even today.","222":"","223":"In the early twentieth century, fatigue research marked a site of conflicting scientific, industrial, and cultural understandings of working bodies. Many fatigue researchers understood fatigue to be a physiological fact and allied themselves with Progressive-era reformers in urging industrial regulation. Reformers clashed with advocates of Taylorism, who held that productivity could be perpetually increased through managerial efficiency. Histories of this conflict typically cease with the end of the First World War. I examine the work of the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory in the 1920s and 1930s to explore the impact that the introduction of biochemical methods had on the relationship between science and reform. The Laboratory developed sophisticated techniques to study the blood of exercising individuals. In particular, it found that exercising individuals could attain a biochemically \"steady state,\" or equilibrium, and extrapolated from this to assert that fatigue was psychological, not physiological, in nature. In contrast to Progressive-era research, the Laboratory reached this conclusion through laboratory examination, not of workers, but of Laboratory staff members and champion marathon runners. I present the Laboratory's institutional history, scientific work, and finally how common cultural understandings of athletes and work lent plausibility to its efforts to make authoritative statements about industrial conditions.","224":"The institutional revolution has become a major landmark of late-nineteenth century science, marking the rapid construction of large, institutional laboratories which transformed scientific training and practice. Although it has served historians of physics well, the institutional revolution has proved much more contentious in the case of chemistry. I use published sources, mainly written by chemists and largely focused on laboratories built in German-speaking lands between about 1865 and 1900, to show that chemical laboratory design was inextricably linked to productive practice, large-scale pedagogy and disciplinary management. I argue that effective management of the novel risks inherent in teaching and doing organic synthesis was significant in driving and shaping the construction of late-nineteenth century institutional chemical laboratories, and that these laboratories were essential to the disciplinary development of chemistry. Seen in this way, the laboratory necessarily becomes part of the material culture of late-nineteenth century chemistry, and I show how this view leads not only to a revision of what is usually known as the laboratory revolution in chemistry but also to a new interpretation of the institutional revolution in physics.","225":"Doris Grant (1905-2003), a middle-class, British housewife, published numerous books from the 1940s into the 1970s urging her fellow housewives to bake organic, wholemeal bread for their families. This article argues that Grant's arguments defy easy categorization as either 'conservative' or 'progressive'. On the one hand, her targeted appeal to women reflected a traditional, conservative understanding of gender roles: women were, first and foremost, wives and mothers and therefore naturally responsible for family diet and health. On the other hand, Grant also pushed her readers to look beyond their homes and recognize a dangerous food supply system that was impinging on their daily lives. She demanded that her readers reject comfortable complicity in this system and preached the value of individual action in effecting substantive change.","226":"A disputed butter competition in Pennsylvania in 1895 brought the cultural, environmental, and scientific character of the Era of Adulteration to the fore. The incident put a spotlight on the confusing character of adulteration and the increasingly prominent role of chemical analysts in arbitrating that confusion. This article uses the case to explore the role scientific analysts played on the border between pure food products and adulterated ones, arguing that the scientists fighting adulteration gained credibility within a cultural environment where trust and confidence were problematic and an agricultural environment where spatial connections between producers and consumers were difficult to see. They were not just detectors of chemical impurities, but participants in a vital cultural arbitration. Characterizing them for their cultural role helps demonstrate that their practices and identity were (and remain) relevant for more than just detection and eradication, then and in the future.","227":"Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in the United States, this article demonstrates how American cheesemakers articulate the work of handcrafting cheese as a balance of 'art' and 'science', where art refers to aesthetic creativity and an intuitive ability to interpret observable conditions as a guide for contingent practice, while science refers to the accurate measuring of those conditions as well as meticulous record-keeping and hygiene. Artisanship thus entails a blend of subjective and objective practice and accounting, characterized here as the application of synaesthetic reason. Mutually defining, art and science in the crafting of cheese are far from mutually exclusive. And both are embedded in larger cultural contexts. Artisanship must also acknowledge market-based tastes and cultural understandings of acceptable form.","228":"According to Enlightenment ideology, knowledge was shared openly in the international Republic of Letters. In reality, the owners of lucrative new technologies were determined to keep their discoveries hidden from industrial spies.","229":"Andreas Vesalius reformed anatomical knowledge and teaching in the Renaissance by adopting Galenic methods from the classical past. His careful drawings revealed the human body in unprecedented and realistic detail, but the images of himself were more ambiguous.","230":"","231":"During the first half of the nineteenth century, breeders of livestock in the United States and Germany began to approach animal husbandry in a more systematic manner. Responding to changes in ideas about heredity and economic pressures, they imported large numbers of animals from abroad, especially from Great Britain. With these imported breeds they set out to transform their native specimens to better meet the needs of an industrializing nation. Their strategies for animal improvement, which included grading, crossing, and pure breeding, constituted practical experiments into heredity that ran parallel to the work of naturalists. By 1860, the modern system of breeding, with its attention to public registries of pedigrees, gained increasing influence in both contexts.","232":"In November 1910, Shirase Nobu (1861-1946) sailed from Tokyo Bay aboard the Kainan Maru as part of an international race for the South Pole. The Japanese had no history of polar exploration and looked to British precedence to compensate for their lack of experience. Following the British example required that they include a scientific dimension to their venture. It is clear, however, that Shirase and his men had little scientific understanding. Nevertheless, on failing to reach the Pole, science became the central aim of the expedition and the primary means to declaring their efforts a success.","233":"In the decades around 1900, industrial anthrax attracted significant attention from medical practitioners, legislators and the general public in Britain. Attempts to reduce the incidence of the disease ranged from basic health measures - preventing workmen from eating inside factories and trialling the use of respirators - through to national legislation making disinfection of dangerous materials mandatory. Another effort involved the production of industrial warning posters (or cautionary notices) which were designed for use in the factory environment. In the case of anthrax, the context in which these notices appeared adds to our understanding of not only the disease itself, but also the relations between those producing such posters and those who encountered them in an industrial setting.","234":"Known primarily for creating beautiful images of butterflies and flowers, Maria Sibylla Merian (German, 1647-1717) has remained largely unappreciated for her seminal contribution to early modern natural history. Merian was indeed a talented artist, but she clearly thought of herself as a naturalist, and employed both text and images to depict lepidopteran metamorphosis and behavior with unprecedented accuracy and detail. Merian documented larvae and adult insects feeding not only on plants, but also on other animals, and she depicted other creatures preying on insects. An image of battling spiders and ants and the accompanying text in her 1705 Metamorphosis insectorum surinamensium illuminated the world of tropical arthropods in a way that was groundbreaking, and set the stage for a new way to envision nature.","235":"Victorian scientists boasted about their commitment to progress, cooperation and public education, but paleontology risked being torn apart by personal rivalries.","236":"Most international sports organisations work on the premise that human beings come in one of two genders: male or female. Consequently, all athletes, including intersex and transgender individuals, must be assigned to compete in one or other category. Since the 1930s (not, as is popularly suggested, the 1960s) these organisations have relied on scientific and medical professionals to provide an 'objective' judgement of an athlete's eligibility to compete in women's national and international sporting events. The changing nature of these judgements reflects a great deal about our cultural, social and national prejudices, while the matter of testing itself has become a site of conflict for feminists and human rights activists. Because of the sensitive nature of this subject, histories of sex testing are difficult to write and research; this has lead to the repetition of inaccurate information and false assertions about gender fraud, particularly in relation to the 'classic' cases of Stella Walsh and Heinrich\/Hermann\/Dora Ratjen. As historians, we need to be extremely careful to differentiate between mythologies and histories.","237":"In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that the United States would join the fledgling global program to eradicate smallpox, beginning with a program in West Africa. The American commitment to smallpox eradication represented a broader effort in the United States and the developing world to expand international health programs and build a Global Great Society. The Global Great Society came to grief, but global smallpox eradication would ultimately succeed.","238":"During the French Revolution, there appeared a striking and far-ranging medical literature on heredity, reproduction and biological 'perfectibility'. In some ways anticipating ideas associated with modern eugenics, these writings emerged from radical revolutionary projects for 'physical and moral regeneration' and incarnated deep-seated desires to transform French society and make a 'new man' in mind and body. But by breaking down boundaries between public and private life, doctors did more than just try to regulate intimate sexual behaviour. Instead, they proffered a more intimate vision of civic volunteerism, in which sexual hygiene and domestic practices allowed their patients to imagine new forms of society and gave them ways to attain these socio-political dreams. Moreover, they were responding to powerful new worries about heredity and sought to counsel their patients in the ways of family panning. By the end of revolutionary period, then, medical and lay thinkers had transformed the marriage bed and household into a specially controlled environment - a kind of affective laboratory - in which conscientious parents could make healthy children and raise them in the context of specific political and social values.","239":"Ever since they began to be widely discussed during the early nineteenth century, evolutionary ideas have played a controversial role in debates about politics and social reform. Understanding the political commitments of those who have sought to integrate politics and evolution is a complex challenge, though; not least because memories of mid-twentieth-century eugenic policies have frequently shaped how we talk about biosocial science. However, as the case of the Scottish biologist-turned-town-planner Patrick Geddes highlights, while we need to be aware of the broad appeal that biosocial science has historically held, we also need to recognise that current political categories can be misleading when thinking about those of who have put evolution and politics together.","240":"","241":"In 1963, by invitation, particle physicist George Reynolds (Princeton University) brought an image intensifier to Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. Together, he and a group of biologists began experimenting with the device as a way to create images of cells in low-light level situations, especially in the study of bioluminescence. In this paper I am interested in how the scientists, a physicist and biologists in collaboration, assessed, interpreted and presented the pictures that they created with the aid of image intensification. In particular, I consider the problem of 'noise' in the image. The paper ends with an example of how Reynolds and a biologist at Woods Hole contended with the presence of noise in images used for publication. Here is an example of how data is modified, that is, enhanced, to serve as scientific evidence. By presenting an early and simple case of the altered image I reveal one way scientists addressed the potentiality of presenting inappropriately modified data - a concern that has garnered much attention in the current age of digital imaging technologies.","242":"In propaganda material, people are often presented in black-and-white terms as either a villain or a hero.

Spacesuited astronauts would carry out exploration, colonization, and settlement as part of a relentlessly forward looking movement of humanity beyond Earth. As time has progressed this image has not changed appreciably even as the full magnitude of the challenges it represents have become more and more apparent. This essay explores the issues associated with the human movement beyond Earth and raises questions about whether humanity will ever be able to survive in the extreme environment of space and the other bodies of the solar system. This paper deals with important historical episodes as well as wider conceptual issues about life in space. Two models of expansion beyond Earth are discussed: (1) the movement of microbes and other types of life on Earth that can survive the space environment and (2) the modification of humans into cyborgs for greater capability to survive in the extreme environments encountered beyond this planet.","244":"Using tissue transplantation, the British scientist Peter Brian Medawar showed how extrinsic cells could be permanently integrated into an animal's body without provoking immune responses. With his study of this phenomenon--which he called 'actively acquired tolerance'--Medawar was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1960 along with the Australian scientist Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who theoretically predicted the possibility. The monumental work of Medawar stems from his long and deep interest in the nature of living organisms' changes over time, such as growth, aging, and evolution. In particular, his concern for the phenomenon of decline played a critical role in his research design regarding tolerance and its interpretation.","245":"","246":"In 1776 and 1777 five living electric eels exhibited in London became a sensational spectacle that appealed to anatomists, electricians and connoisseurs of erotica. George Baker's exhibition made visible the 'electric spark' of the electrical eel and a series of experiments were both witnessed by and participated in by members of the Royal Society and the metropolitan elite. Some participants even grasped the eels firmly in their hands and felt the 'electric stroke' of the eel in addition to observing the spark. In their observation of the electric eel some of these spectators transposed the vivid electric spark from the sphere of electricians and anatomists into that of satirical and erotic literature. Here the erotic electric eel proliferated in the literature and the eel took on quite different connotations that nonetheless were reliant on readers knowledge and experience of the exhibition, experiments and the preoccupations of anatomists. George Baker's electric eel exhibition of 1776 and 1777 is then instructive in exploring the production and circulation of knowledge in Georgian Britain. The story of the electric eel in Georgian culture charts the creation of the electric spark and stroke as objects of observation and encounter, their exhibitionary context, and finally their divergent meanings as the electric eel became erotically charged for a metropolitan masculine elite.","247":"During the second Jurassic dinosaur rush museum paleontologists raced to display the world's first mounted sauropod dinosaur. The American Museum of Natural History triumphed in 1905 when its Brontosaurus debuted before an admiring crowd of wealthy New Yorkers. The Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago and other institutions were quick to follow with their own sauropod displays. Thereafter, dinomania spread far and wide, and big, showpiece dinosaurs became a museum staple. This brief but intensely competitive period of acquisitiveness fostered important Jurassic dinosaur revisions and crucial innovations in paleontological field and lab techniques.","248":"Shocked by what he considered to be the savagery he encountered in Tierra del Fuego, Charles Darwin ranked the Fuegians lowest among the human races. An enduring story has it, however, that Darwin was later so impressed by the successes of missionaries there, and by the grandeur they discovered in the native tongue, that he changed his mind. This story has served diverse interests, religious and scientific. But Darwin in fact continued to view the Fuegians as he had from the start, as lowly but improvable. And while his case for their unity with the other human races drew on missionary evidence, that evidence concerned emotional expression, not language.","249":"","250":"Over the last several decades historians have shown that the eugenics movement appealed to an extraordinarily wide constituency. Far from being the brainchild of the members of any one particular political ideology, eugenics made sense to a diverse range of Americans and was promoted by professionals ranging from geneticists and physicians to politicians and economists.(1) Seduced by promises of permanent fixes to national problems, and attracted to the idea of a scientifically legitimate form of social activism, eugenics quickly grew in popularity during the first decades of the twentieth century. Charles M. Goethe, the land developer, entrepreneur, conservationist and skilled advertiser who founded the Eugenics Society of Northern California, exemplifies the broad appeal of the eugenics movement. Goethe played an active role within the American eugenics movement at its peak in the 1920s. The last president of the Eugenics Research Association,(2) he also campaigned hard against Mexican immigration to the US and he continued open support for the Nazi regime's eugenic practices into the later 1930s.(3) This article examines Goethe's eugenic vision and, drawing on his correspondence with the leading geneticist Charles Davenport, explores the relationship between academic and non-academic advocates of eugenics in America.","251":"","252":"This article examines the church's embrace of scientific methodologies in the late nineteenth century. It is argued that in general, the shift worked to repel liberal ridicule and control popular devotions. However, in Mexico the effects were mixed. During the Mexican Revolution, a desperate church was forced to apply these new scientific methodologies to increasingly unauthorized cults.","253":"The wealth of American millionaires, the greed of Nazi art collectors and a positivist faith in the authority of laboratory science all contributed to the emergence of conservation science as a new discipline. Yet, not before the aftermath years of the Second World War was scientific expertise accepted as valid knowledge by both art critics and the general public. Becoming an expert depended not only on knowledge and skills, but also on the successful negotiation of the vested interests of a wide range of stakeholders. The creation of museum laboratories proved to be decisive in making space for science in the world of art.","254":"","255":"Food was and is an essential component in human space exploration. If it had not proved possible to eat and digest in space, none of the long-term space missions of the last four decades would have been achievable. Every country that has sent an astronaut on a mission has used its national foods as a means of stating both their presence and their identity to their colleagues in the programme and their citizens at home: in space, as on earth, food has provided a means of asserting national culture. From the earliest missions, the US and USSR's differing attitudes to the programme have been reflected in the food provided and the respective administrations' approaches to feeding in space. The contrast between the US focus on space travel and the USSR's focus on space living is highlighted through their attitudes to the often vexed question of what astronauts and cosmonauts should be permitted to eat, illustrated by the corned-beef sandwich incident of 1965.","256":null,"257":"If travel has been one of the leitmotifs of Western imagination, Robinson Crusoe has certainly been one of its foremost incarnations. This British Ulysses foretold the global village, but also its problems. He predicted the end of distance, but also the triumph of isolation and anaesthetized loneliness. This paper provides an overview of the connections between Defoe's narrative and the new science and explores two versions of the story by two contemporary writers, Julio Cortazar and John Maxwell Coetzee.","258":"Minerva was the goddess of wisdom and war, the Roman equivalent of the Greek Pallas Athene. Like all mythical figures, she was repeatedly reinterpreted to carry different rhetorical messages.","259":"Teaching his students the art of observing nature outdoors was central to the Swedish naturalist Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778). These exercises came to influence both their progress and his work. The open-air classroom was a stage where Linnaeus could demonstrate his skills and mobilize support. It was also a testing, training and recruitment ground: the students' field observations helped Linnaeus to develop his new scientific nomenclature, and it was in the field that students could train their observational skills and progress from novices to naturalists.","260":"AIDS posters can be treated as material objects whose production, distribution and consumption varied across time and place. It is also possible to reconstruct and analyse the public health discourse at the time these powerful images appeared. More recently, however, these conventional historical approaches have been challenged by projects in literary and art criticism. Here, images of AIDS are considered in terms of their function in and for a new discursive regime of power centred on the human body and its visualization. How images of AIDS came to be understood in Western culture in relation to wider political and economic conditions redefines the historical task.","261":"Situated at the center of intellectual life in baroque Rome, the museum administered by the Jesuit naturalist Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) simultaneously instructed and bemused its audiences with an exuberant mix of exotic animals, classical art and technological marvels. Kircher's playful use of spectacle and his irrepressible fondness for \"magic\" were derided by contemporaries as frivolous wonder-mongering, but the lavish machines at the heart of his museum were more than mere showpieces. Instead, they presented audiences with a compelling vision of the natural world in which the hidden foundations of the universe could be captured and displayed by artifice. Kircher's collection was in itself a vast instrument of revelation, conceived on a grander scale than the telescope of Galileo but rooted all the same in contemporary scientific culture.","262":"Ask most visitors to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, why they have come and they will tell you that they want to stand on 'the line'. Press them further and they might add something about standing astride longitude zero, one foot in the eastern hemisphere and one in the west. Few know how the Prime Meridian of the world comes to pass through Greenwich, or even realise that the line is there because of the observatory, rather than vice versa. But the line, of course, has a history, as does the public's response to it.","263":"Darwin famously built the ground-breaking argument of On the Origin of Species out of an analogy between artificial selection ('breeding') and what he called 'nature's power of selection'--or, more famously, 'natural selection'. For years, historians of science have debated the origins of this analogy and philosophers of science have disputed exactly how well it works. But is Darwin's argument really an analogy? A closer look at what the world-travelling naturalist of the Beagle has to say about selection among 'savages' opens a more complicated story.","264":null,"265":"In the 19th century, mechanical hearing aids opened up new possibilities for controlling sound waves and managing conversations. Components and ideals from these acoustical instruments became part of the foundation for electroacoustics, the conversion of sounds into \"signals\". Mechanical hearing aids also set lasting standards for portability and unobtrusiveness in the design of personal communication technology.","266":"In the first twenty years after the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, an intense debate took place within the ranks of Darwin's supporters over exactly what his theory implied about the means by which the original living organism formed on Earth. Many supporters of evolutionary science also supported the doctrine of spontaneous generation: life forming from nonliving material not just once but many times up to the present day. Darwin was ambivalent on this topic. He feared its explosive potential to drive away liberal-minded Christians who might otherwise be supporters. His ambivalent wording created still more confusion, both among friends and foes, about what Darwin actually believed about the origin of life. A famous lecture by Thomas H. Huxley in 1870 set forth what later became the 'party line' Darwinian position on the subject.","267":"An astute diplomat, Alessandro Volta secured the patronage of Napoleon Bonaparte to promote his rise to fame as an electrical expert. Reciprocally, politicians helped their own causes by presenting him as a national as well as a scientific figurehead.","268":"Orthopaedists have long found hip fractures to be a significant source of clinical uncertainty and professional disagreement. For much of the nineteenth century, surgeons were happy to follow Sir Astley Cooper's directive to 'treat the patient and let the fracture go'. Most sufferers were elderly, near the end of their lives and at significant risk from morbid complications. This palliative posture was further justified by a substantial corpus of medical evidence. Any attempt at therapeutic innovation was unwarranted because clinical experience, post-mortem studies and animal experiments indicated that fractures within the hip joint never healed. Yet as there were isolated cases of intra-capsular healing, surgeons such as Nicholas Senn began to contest this evidence. To his consternation, as he tried to demonstrate the possibility of restorative treatments, Senn found the fundamental problem with hip fractures was that the empiricism of current clinical methods created and perpetuated their own therapeutic justifications.","269":"In present-day pharmacology and medicine, it is usually taken for granted that cells contain a host of highly specific receptors. These are defined as proteins on or within the cell that bind with specificity to particular drugs, chemical messenger substances or hormones and mediate their effects on the body. However, it is only relatively recently that the notion of drug-specific receptors has become widely accepted, with considerable doubts being expressed about their existence as late as the 1960s. When did the receptor concept emerge, how did it evolve and why did it take so long to become established?","270":"Mabel Boyden was a biologist, active in the field of immunochemical research and also a custodian of the Serological Museum at Rutgers University between 1948 and 1974. Her recollection of a trip to obtain the blood of the horseshoe crab is revealing: it contains figures of speech that give a glimpse into the immunological discourse of the mid-1960s; it shows how her thinking was torn between different ways of doing biology; and it offers an insight into the transition of biology into the modern, molecular era.","271":"Four hundred years ago Galileo Galilei aimed a telescope at the sky. He revolutionized astronomy. Equally revolutionary were his experiments in physics. Unlike his astronomical observations the experiments remain difficult to understand and replicate even today. Two centuries after Galileo, Augustin Coulomb demonstrated experimentally the law of electrostatic force. It has never been successfully replicated. Yet both Galileo and Coulomb were exquisite experimentalists. The fact is that revolutionary experiments in physics are never finished. They are open for investigation for generations to come.","272":"","273":"Controversies in science often centre on methodology and integrity; these are the gatekeepers of proper science. But what exactly defines proper science as proper is not universal, especially in collaborative fields of enquiry where different perspectives meet. These encounters often result in friction, yet may equally give rise to new perspectives on proper science. A tour of collaborative endeavours like structural biology and nutrigenomics highlights some of those frictions and the controversies that can result from the encounter of 'wet' and 'dry' science. Attuning scientists to the plurality of proper science may safeguard many a scientist's integrity from being questioned unjustly.","274":"The arrival of Miss Congo, a female mountain gorilla, in America provided the opportunity for a scientific study of the mental abilities of our close cousin. Since the mid-nineteenth century, gorillas had captivated the imagination of the public and scientific community alike. In 1925, psychobiologist Robert Mearns Yerkes was thrilled to gain access to such a rare primate specimen. Yerkes' study of 'The Mind of a Gorilla' reveals how our enduring fascination with the gorilla is driven by conflicting desires to demonstrate our connection with and distance from our fellow great apes.","275":"In 1942 Australian troops came back from fighting the Japanese in New Guinea exhausted and malnourished. The army rations of bully beef and biscuits were insufficiently rich in vitamins to sustain men in combat in tropical conditions. The nutritionist C. Stanton Hicks was one of a vast army of scientists who worked behind the scenes to maximize the war effort. He made it his mission to improve the army diet. He set up the Australian Army Catering Corps, invented combat ration packs and tried to introduce vitamin-rich foods into the soldiers' diet. Two of his more idiosyncratic innovations were wheat porridge and Tasmanian blue peas.","276":"In 1955, a highly secret Government report painted a bleak picture of Britain after a nuclear war. Without greatly improved civil defence measures, the report warned, a hydrogen bomb attack on Britain could kill one-third of the population within 24h and leave swathes of land uninhabitable. But Government advice to the public told a different story, offering cheerful advice about vacuuming up radioactive fallout and building shelters from books and furniture. Meanwhile, civil defence spending cuts left the public lacking even the standard of protection they had enjoyed during the Second World War. This seemingly paradoxical Government response was shaped by conflicting financial and political pressures, and by the work of the Home Office scientists whose research underpinned British civil defence planning.","277":"We often think of Tokugawa Japan as a closed society. As represented by Hiraga Gennai - one of the most colourfully inventive figures of his age - we see that domestic and imported knowledge and skill were put to work there in carefully managed ways to achieve domestic peace and prosperity. Gennai's career has much to tell us about how material and knowledge production went hand-in-hand in Tokugawa Japan and the extent to which local interests directed the adoption and adaptation of European knowledge and skills. Tracing his biography reveals that the analytical distinctions so often made between science, technology and commerce do not hold up in practice and should also serve as a warning against histories of the global 'diffusion' or 'influence' of western science.","278":"The metaphor of 'Spaceship Earth' employed by a diverse array of scientists, economists and politicians during the 1960s and 1970s points to the Cold War origins of the first global environmentalist movement. With the advent of Spaceship Earth, nature itself became at once technological artifact and a vital object of Cold War gamesmanship. The evolution of this metaphor uncovers the connections between Cold War technologies such as nuclear weapons, space travel and cybernetics, and the birth of the first global environmentalist movement. Revisiting Spaceship Earth may help us to better understand the implicit assumptions that have both empowered and limited that movement.","279":"It could come as a shock to learn that some seventeenth-century men of science and learning thought that mountains were bad. Even more alarmingly, some thought that God had imposed them on the earth to punish man for his sins. By the end of the seventeenth century, surprisingly many English natural philosophers and theologians were engaged in a debate about whether mountains were 'good' or 'bad', useful or useless. At stake in this debate were not just the careers of its participants, but arguments about the best ways of looking at and reckoning with 'nature' itself.","280":"In the early twentieth century, mothers began to turn towards scientific infant-feeding formulae as an alternative to breastfeeding their babies. This is strange because the benefits of breastfeeding were widely recognised. The extraordinary rise of the formula feed therefore demands a special explanation, one that includes an appreciation of key changes in public health, the emergence of paediatrics as a profession, commercial interests and advances in the sciences of bacteriology and nutrition. All these factors conspired to propel the formula feed to the fore.","281":"Renaissance philosophers believed that God had created a harmonious cosmos bonded together mathematically. This intellectual approach was also embraced by some artists, who incorporated complex numerical and geometrical symbolism within their portraits.","282":"In the nineteenth century, both spleen and nostalgia were considered clinical categories, and each associated with the character of a nation. English medical commentators boasted of their compatriots' resistance to nostalgia, an often fatal form of homesickness, while the French in turn argued that the splenetic English were flocking to France to escape their own insalubrious climate. Behind such jingoistic claims were broader concerns, on both sides of the channel but particularly acute for the French, about the impact of modernity on subjectivity, the relation between home, homeland and empire, and the fitness of both nations to succeed in the modern age.","283":"","284":null,"285":"The long-term marital dance of Emma and Charles Darwin was set to the routine beat of an almost daily piano recital. Emma was a proficient pianist, and so a quality instrument was a welcome and appropriate house-warming present for their first marital home in London. That same piano accompanied the Darwins on their move to Downe before being upgraded for a newer model, which is still there, whilst another, cheaper piano may have played in Charles Darwin's work, particularly on earthworms. Whilst he lamented his own lack of musicality, Darwin revelled in his wife's prowess, a capacity that he recognised could be inherited, not least through observation of his own children. The evolution of musicality, he reasoned, was rooted in sexual attraction as a form of communication that preceded language.","286":"","287":"Across the United States in the 1910s thousands of parents entered their children in the widely popular Better Babies contests. During the competitions, physicians and other health professionals examined and scored children for their bodily measurements, and physical and mental development. The baby with the highest score won. These contests not only served as a means of identifying children with previously unknown health conditions, but also taught mothers that through scientific care they could make their children into standardized babies, and therefore productive citizens of the future.","288":"Photographs of the processes taking place in the air around a flying bullet, which the Austrian physicists Ernst Mach and Peter Salcher published in 1887, very soon became emblematic for the power of scientific photography over the human eye. But the main advantage was merely that photography allowed the phenomena in question to be recorded. This permitted a new experimental approach. The scientists were therefore not visualising phenomena by studying a single photograph but by comparing the differences between several.","289":"The H.J. Heinz Company's commitment to the purity and quality of its products in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century helped usher in an era of industrial food. While canning had been around for decades, it was not until both scientist and technologists innovations solved problems like bacterial contamination and mass-produced cans that Americans began to eat canned food on a regular basis. In addition to money-back guarantees, Heinz pioneered product tastings as a marketing tool in an attempt to convince skeptical housewives that his products were not only delicious, but were also safe to eat.","290":"In the Lancet in the 1850s a series of reports described gruesome levels of adulteration in Londoners' food. Following a government inquiry, The Times lauded the supposed hero of the hour, Arthur Hill Hassall MD. In response a furious and acrimonious argument erupted in the letters-pages of The Times and two other medical journals. The details of this argument reveal that not everybody agreed that the success of the Analytical Sanitary Commission was down to Hassall's scientific evidence.","291":"Just before the outbreak of World War I, British suffragettes were imprisoned in large numbers. Many engaged in hunger strikes and suffered brutal treatment, most notoriously forced feeding. Government authorities, backed by prominent physicians, justified forced feeding by citing its successful use with insane patients in asylums. In the nineteenth century forced feeding was, in fact, common in the asylum and much discussed in leading medical publications. Physicians generally ignored the feelings of patients, concentrating on technical problems such as the design of feeding instruments. Nor did critics amid the suffrage crisis sympathize with asylum patients. They defended women protesters but portrayed the force-fed insane as insensate. Forced feeding of the insane was nonetheless tainted by its association with the brutalization of suffragettes and in later years rarely discussed outside specialized psychiatric venues.","292":"Natural philosophers of the early-modern period perceived fool's gold or iron pyrites as a substance required for the formation of metals, and chemists such as Johann Glauber speculated the vitriol produced from pyrites was the source of the legendary philosopher's stone. The sulphurous exhalations of fool's gold were also thought by members of the early Royal Society to be the basis of a variety of meteorological, geological and medical effects, including the production of thunder, lightning, earthquakes and volcanoes, fossilisation and petrifaction, as well as the principal cause of bladder and gallstones.","293":"Since 1968, when Garrett Hardin wrote his essay entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons', the idea that human reproduction must be brought under the coercive control of state power has been rejected by every government on earth, with the qualified exception of the People's Republic of China. The metaphor that Hardin used to convey his message, however, has proliferated, adapted and evolved. Its original neo-Malthusian message now largely forgotten, 'The Tragedy of the Commons' has become a wildly popular metaphor in a variety of fields from ecology to property law to the programmatic architecture of the Internet.","294":"The nineteenth-century Anglican theologian Charles Kingsley was immediately impressed by Darwin's Origin of Species. Whilst many in Victorian Britain reacted against the idea of natural selection, Kingsley saw in the contingency of selection a divinely ordained imperative for human endeavour, not least the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Here, Kingsley believed, was a crucial insight into the seemingly indifferent laws of nature, one that humankind could use to elevate themselves to ever-greater heights. Kingsley chose to teach these lessons about the moral nature of evolution through 'Water Babies', one of the most charming and enduring of children's fairy tales.","295":null,"296":"Nicholas Copernicus'De revolutionibus (1543) is a frequent starting point for histories of the Scientific Revolution on account of his dramatic reversal of the cosmic order handed down from antiquity. Nevertheless, Copernicus also mounted a surprisingly sharp attack on one of his contemporaries who tried to correct ancient astronomers. This uneasy balance between respecting and criticizing ancient works was part of broader contemporaneous attempts to grapple with the fragmentary legacies of past generations. Debates over stone ruins as well as manuscript texts shaped the evolution of early printed books, and artists, printers and instrument makers joined natural philosophers in pursuing novelties even while emulating tradition.","297":"As an image-making tool for scientists studying the transient, instantaneous photography has long been seen as opening up a visual realm previously inaccessible to the inferior testimony of the human eye. But when photographic pioneer Henry Fox Talbot took the first photograph of a moving object by the light of an electric spark in 1851, he was guided by existing visual practices designed to create instantaneous vision in the eye itself. Exploring the background behind the peculiar subject of his experiment - a mechanically spinning disc - reveals a hidden prehistory of spark-illuminated photography: physicists' pre-photographic techniques for stopping time.","298":"With the isolation of quinine from Cinchona in 1820, an ancient herbal cure was transformed into a chemical drug. This was the inspiration for a new scientific discipline - ethnopharmacology - as Western scientists began to reinvent traditional herbal cures by extracting their active principles to make new and profitable drugs. The Chinese government may claim many such success stories as their own, but such triumphant narratives only reveal part of the story. The drawn-out hunt for the active principle of another anti-malarial herb, changshan, or Dichroa febrifuga, offers a more nuanced narrative that captures the complex interplay between traditional Chinese and Western medicine.","299":"When you hear the phrase 'chemistry set', what is the first image that pops into your head? Is it one of a mad scientist in a dark laboratory full of pieces of glassware bubbling over? Is it your high school or college chemistry lab? For many, the phrase evokes a time of exploration and experimentation, a time where a child could be and do anything they could imagine. Although first and foremost to be a toy providing hours of entertainment, chemistry sets also allowed children to interact intimately with science. It is these interactions that led many to go on to become famous chemists and physicists. By studying these sets - their content, the imagery surrounding them and the people that used them - we can hopefully better understand how society viewed, and continues to view, science.","300":"British imperial expansion opened up new worlds for naturalists to collect and catalogue many species of plants and animals unknown in Europe. David Douglas' travels to the northwest region of North America in the 1820s exemplified, in many ways, the science of empire. Under the aegis of the Hudson's Bay Company, the main representative of British influence in the Northwest, Douglas was able to journey throughout the region and collect a significant number of plants that found their way into British gardens. Yet Douglas was not only a collector aided by imperial institutions, but also, through his expertise, an agent of imperialism.","301":"In 1518, one of the strangest epidemics in recorded history struck the city of Strasbourg. Hundreds of people were seized by an irresistible urge to dance, hop and leap into the air. In houses, halls and public spaces, as fear paralyzed the city and the members of the elite despaired, the dancing continued with mindless intensity. Seldom pausing to eat, drink or rest, many of them danced for days or even weeks. And before long, the chronicles agree, dozens were dying from exhaustion. What was it that could have impelled as many as 400 people to dance, in some cases to death?","302":"Mary Somerville enjoyed posing for busts and portraits, yet just as in her autobiography, she chose how she wished to be seen. A powerful advocate for scientific progress, Somerville gave her name to a ship that carried British products around the world, and portrayed herself as an ideal role model for women and also an exemplar of European civilisation.","303":"Throughout the nineteenth century, German medical, scientific and legal scholars found themselves puzzled and engaged by the diverse forms of human sexuality. Psychiatrists like Richard von Krafft-Ebing who were interested in explaining deviance encountered scientifically trained advocates for emancipation like Magnus Hirschfeld, and the result was the new--if unstable--discipline of sexual science. Because they based arguments for social intervention on knowledge of nature and the body, the field's proponents--like the advocates of eugenics and racial hygiene--argued that they were biologists. After 1900, this mutual biological engagement of sexual science and eugenics revealed itself in overlapping debates between the proponents of both fields.","304":"Making a life-sized model of a blue whale is difficult. Making one to the exacting standards of 'scientific accuracy' is backbreaking. When, in the early 1960s, the American Museum of Natural History in New York undertook to fabricate a replica of the largest animal that ever lived, little was known about how blue whales really looked and behaved in the wild. Exhibitors like Richard Van Gelder guided themselves by old photographs, illustrations, tables of measurements and the experience of other institutions--as well as their own educated guesswork, and ideas of beauty, value and pride.","305":"Alfred Russel Wallace's role in prompting the original publication of \"On the Origin of Species\" is now generally acknowledged. Wallace is now widely recognised as 'Darwin's co-discoverer', but the role that he played in the development and promotion of Darwinism is more often overlooked. From the very beginning of their collaboration in 1858, there were important differences between the works of Wallace and Darwin. Within Darwin's lifetime, the two men also disagreed over several significant evolutionary debates, most notably the role that Natural Selection might play in evolution. Following Darwin's death in 1882, Wallace set about promoting his own version of 'Darwinism', but not without opposition. A rather ungentlemanly debate between Wallace and Darwin's chief disciple George John Romanes throws light on the contested nature of what it meant to be a Darwinian in the late nineteenth century.","306":"Although Aristotle was often portrayed during the early modern period, his imagined appearance varied widely. When modern interpreters try to impose definitive meanings on pictures, they run the risk of overlooking symbolic resonances which can be just as significant as direct representation.","307":"Those who would seek monsters not as metaphors, but as flesh and blood organisms have gone largely overlooked by the history of science. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s a group of amateur monster hunters and physical anthropologists began to pursue such creatures as Sasquatch, Bigfoot and the Yeti as living species. Whether or not such creatures exist, the monster hunters themselves are fascinating subjects for study, illustrating the tensions that are all too common between amateur naturalists and professional scientists.","308":"The secret of the hydrogen bomb went from being an icon of nuclear secrecy to something that could be widely reproduced on the Internet and in children's textbooks. The rise and fall of the H-bomb secret reveals both changing attitudes towards state secrecy in general and the contingent nature of secrecy, depending on an imagined threat as guidance.","309":"Before heading to a 'tropical' region of the Empire, British men and women spent considerable time and effort gathering outfit believed essential for their impending trip. Ordinary items such as soap, clothing, foodstuffs and bedding became transformed into potentially life-saving items that required the fastidious attention of any would-be traveller. Everyone from scientists and physicians to missionaries and administrators was bombarded by relentless advertising and abundant advice about the outfit needed to preserve health in a tropical climate. A closer look at this marketing exercise reveals much about the way people thought about tropical people, places, health and hygiene and how scientific and commercial influences shaped this Imperial commodity culture.","310":"In the early Victorian home, there were plenty of scientific lessons to be uncovered. With the appropriate interrogation, everyday objects could transform seemingly mundane activities such as eating breakfast, washing clothes or reading by candle-light into household lectures that gave children a familiar base from which to explore the hidden properties and marvellous histories of common commodities. Responding to an unprecedented hunger for scientific knowledge, a profusion of introductory texts appeared in the mid-nineteenth century that directed lessons into homes across Britain and beyond. In particular, the science of chemistry found its way into this domestic setting, as writers promoted its practice and practitioners as a source of authoritative expertise on everyday life. One of the most compelling illustrations of this encounter between the public and chemistry took place over a simple cup of tea.","311":"Everyone is familiar with fireworks, common to festivals and celebrations across the world. At first glance, the history of science might appear to have little to do with the history of these explosive devices. However, fireworks were an important element of court culture in Europe, which relied on spectacle and festival to manifest the power of princes. From the fifteenth century, courts regularly set off fireworks around elaborate theatrical scenery and ephemeral temples, fascinating audiences with a variety of exotic motions and effects exploding in the night sky. Fireworks also intrigued natural philosophers, and over several centuries there were diverse interactions among the sciences and pyrotechny.","312":"In the 1960s, stories of children fighting cancer, previously absent from the British news, started to feature ever more prominently in the national press. Conventional treatments could not keep children alive for many months, so the promise of a cure through the use of an alternative anti-cancer 'serum' was not easily dismissed as quackery. The Ministry of Health and cancer research organisations struggled to find a fair and honest way to inform the public and affected families about childhood leukaemia without raising or crushing hope.","313":"The Science Museum in London has over a hundred dioramas in its holdings, prepared at various times since 1931 for a range of exhibitions and displays. These have become simultaneously more interesting as artefacts in their own right, and more threatened as display fashion changes and their original purpose is less relevant to today's audiences. Nonetheless, they are immensely powerful as devices for communication to audiences and their own histories add depth to our understanding of how museums work.","314":"It is a decade since the exposure of Project Coast, apartheid South Africa's covert chemical and biological warfare program. In that time, attention has been focused on several aspects of the program, particularly the production of narcotics and poisons for use against anti-apartheid activists and the proliferation of both chemical and biological weapons. The eugenic dimension of Project Coast has, by contrast, received scant attention. It is time to revisit the testimony that brought the suggestion of eugenic motives to light, reflect on some of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's findings and search for lessons that can be taken from this troubled chapter in South Africa's history.","315":"Rainmaking, hail busting, fog lifting, snowpack enhancing, lightning suppressing, hurricane snuffing...weather control. At the lunatic fringe of scientific discussion in the early twentieth century--and the subject of newspaper articles with tones ranging from skeptical titters to awestruck wonder--weather modification research became more serious after World War II. In the United States, the 'seeds' of silver iodide and dry ice purported to enhance rainfall and bust hailstorms soon became seeds of controversy from which sprouted attempts by federal, state and local government to control the controllers and exploit 'designer weather' for their own purposes.","316":"After he returned from his five-year expedition to the New World, Alexander von Humboldt promoted himself as a Romantic explorer. Although this image pervades British perceptions, political movements have fashioned different heroic versions of Humboldt in Germany and South America.","317":null,"318":"This paper explores the norms, values and ethical attitudes that Linus Pauling wanted to convey to his students in his famous textbook College Chemistry. In this classic textbook, Pauling aimed to introduce beginners into the world of chemistry by presenting chemistry as a systematic science based on a collection of empirical data and a recent theoretical framework. In doing so, he expressed his epistemic and didactic choices clearly. College Chemistry therefore offers an ideal opportunity to examine some of the norms at the core of chemistry's 'moral economy'.","319":null,"320":"William Thomson--honoured as Baron Kelvin of Largs--was Victorian Britain's most famous physicist, especially celebrated for laying the trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. As well as profiting financially from his many engineering projects, Kelvin introduced influential theories about energy and electromagnetism, all strongly coloured by his industrial experiences and the thrifty attitudes of Scottish Christians. Never accepting radioactivity as an additional energy source to the sun, he insisted that the Earth's life span was far too short for evolution to have taken place.","321":"On 23 September 1954, Mr Aikichi Kuboyama died, the first Japanese victim of the Bikini incident--an American hydrogen bomb experiment on Bikini Atoll that took place on 1 March under the codename Operation Castle. This tragedy had several important consequences, influencing post-war negotiations between Japan and the United States over nuclear weapons, stimulating Japanese research into the biological effects of radiation and inspiring a commitment to the treatment of radiation sickness.","322":"Chanting wasps and shape-shifting worms were all in a day's work for sixteenth-century Chinese naturalists such as Li Shizhen (1518-1593). In an effort to understand the metamorphoses of both nature and the human body, he and other early modern Chinese scholars looked towards tiny creatures like roundworms, lice and demon bugs. For them, such animals could reveal the most intimate secrets of the universe.","323":"Although the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe reacted against Copernicus by restoring the earth to the centre of the cosmos, he built sophisticated instruments to compile massive sets of accurate data. A skilled self-publicist, he commissioned portraits of himself as he established a new type of astronomical research.","324":"What did it mean to go under water in the early modern period? Diving bells had been employed since antiquity, but in the late seventeenth century spectacular recoveries from sunken Caribbean treasure ships prompted renewed innovation. Edmond Halley's diving engine of the 1690s tried to make the depths amenable to the human senses and practical manipulation. This striking attempt to create a dry world under water was part of a larger Baroque culture of the submarine that delighted in astonishing transformations between wet and dry.","325":"Since the renaissance, specimens have been central tools of knowledge production in zoological endeavours. The biographies of CN86 and CN87 of the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen--specimens formerly known as hip-bones of giants--have travelled through 300 years of human history, a journey that reveals how the accumulation of objects and changes in scientific methodology can give rise to radical reinterpretation. Although the material form of these specimens has hardly changed, the ideas associated with them have undergone extraordinary transition.","326":null,"327":"An explosion on the Sun in 1859, serendipitously witnessed by amateur astronomer Richard Carrington, plunged telegraphic communications into chaos and bathed two thirds of the Earth's skies in aurorae. Explaining what happened to the Sun and how it could affect Earth, 93 million miles away, helped change the direction of astronomy. From being concerned principally with charting the stars to aid navigation, astronomers became increasingly concerned with what the celestial objects were, how they behaved and how they might affect life on Earth.","328":"A century ago, the German botanist Hans Winkler (best known for coining the term 'genome') accomplished two novel transplantations. First, he produced a single plant that grafted together two completely disparate species: tomato and nightshade. Second, he chose the descriptive word 'chimaera' to name his innovation, transplanting the term from mythology to biology. This paper features Mrs McK, the first human chimera, and thus follows the term from botany to clinical medicine. Her remarkable story, pieced together from the notes, drafts and correspondence of Robert Race and his colleagues at the MRC Blood Group Unit, draws attention to the significance of names and naming.","329":"Electricity was the craze of the eighteenth century. Thrilling experiments became forms of polite entertainment for ladies and gentlemen who enjoyed feeling sparks, shocks and attractions on their bodies. Popular lecturers designed demonstrations that were performed in darkened salons to increase the spectacle of the so-called electric fire. Not only did the action, the machinery and the ambience of such displays match the culture of the libertine century, it also provided new material for erotic literature.","330":"William Harvey has long been celebrated as the founding father of physiology for refuting Galen and demonstrating that blood circulates round the body. Yet after his training at Padua, he became a committed Aristotelian: although strongly influencing the new observational sciences of the seventeenth century, Harvey himself looked back towards the classical past.","331":null,"332":"The concept of the cell has been based on metaphor since its inception, and the history of cell theory has continued to rely on metaphor and analogy. In the nineteenth century, cells were most popularly conceived either as building stones or elementary autonomous organisms from which larger organisms are composed. With advances in physiology and the rise of modern biochemistry in the early twentieth century, the chemical factory or laboratory became the dominant metaphor for this biological unit. Today in the twenty-first century, the metaphorical imagery has become a reality, with cells acting as chemical factories for the synthesis of commercially valuable bio-products. The history of the cell shows how metaphors act as conceptual tools, with particular strengths for facilitating different sorts of questions and experimental techniques.","333":"In November 1949, chemist Linus Pauling and three colleagues published an article on sickle-cell anemia, a study that opened up new and exciting possibilities for research into such 'molecular diseases'. Even before this celebrated publication appeared in Science, Pauling foresaw its potential benefits and announced it as a medical breakthrough: '... our structural chemistry and understanding of molecules is getting to the point where it should be of assistance in converting medicine into a real science' [Guiles, R. (1949) Discovery of blood disease called key to cancer research. The Detroit Times 13 Sep 1949, Newspaper Clippings 1949n.18, Pauling Papers.]. Their discovery--that this debilitating disorder was caused by an abnormal form of hemoglobin--was borne out of a rich mix of expertise, from Pauling's remarkable intuition to the careful experimental chemistry of his student Harvey A. Itano. It also relied upon technological innovation: a custom-made electrophoresis machine housed at the California Institute of Technology was the perfect tool to reveal fundamental chemical differences between normal and abnormal forms of hemoglobin. Not only did this work establish a new way of looking at inherited diseases, it also stimulated the mass production of the electrophoresis machine as an essential investigative and diagnostic tool. A close inspection of this case study illustrates just how Pauling ran his laboratory and helps to explain how one man could achieve so much over his lifetime.","334":"One of the central dogmas of modern science is that the world around us can be understood in terms of microscopic chemical entities known as atoms. It may come as a surprise that this notion has only been widely acknowledged since the 1910s. The French physicist Jean Perrin had a hand in many of the key developments that led to the emergence of the atomic doctrine. His life story relates how new technologies were used to 'see' these invisible particles of philosophy and how scientists were able to determine their size and composition. The indivisible atoms of the ancients were replaced by the highly structured elements of chemistry.","335":"Did Vermeer van Delft create some of his paintings by means of a camera obscura? This still undecided question has stirred up heated debates. For some, the mere idea is an inexcusable insult on a great artist. All this heat has drawn attention away from a rich seam of questioning: what was the seventeenth-century camera obscura really like? And did it shape the ways in which Vermeer's contemporaries viewed, imagined, understood and, for that matter, rendered the visual world?","336":null,"337":"The division of Berlin in the aftermath of World War II and the erection of the Wall in 1961 were not only of tremendous political, social and cultural significance, but also had implications for the way in which science was undertaken in this city. For ecologists living and working in the enclosed city part of West Berlin, the lack of accessible countryside motivated them to focus their fieldwork increasingly on urban sites and, thereby, to engage themselves in one of the most significant attempts to develop an ecology of the city.","338":"The rapid spread of the 1889-1890 influenza epidemic was widely reported in the periodical press. As Londoners read that another European capital had succumbed, they were struck that the illness was not only travelling as fast as the news, but was also moving along the same routes. Although medical science quickly resolved that a germ was the cause of the illness, its mild nature but widespread social impact lead many to suspect that it was actually caused by newspaper hype. This link between the press and the illness made the epidemic seem a curious symptom of the modern communications technologies that increasingly defined the age.","339":"In 1983, after devoting some eight years of his life to the description of how a nematode worm develops from an embryo into an adult, molecular biologist John Sulston embarked on a remarkably different project: he decided to map the worm's genome. Sulston's impulsive desire to characterise this creature's DNA from start to finish offers only a partial explanation for this transition. Instead, a close examination of the wider social context for this 'moment' in molecular biology gives a more rewarding explanation of Sulston's intellectual leap. This reveals a world in which biotechnology gradually adapted to and integrated into an 'information society' increasingly dependent on the creation, distribution and manipulation of information. The application of computing to DNA during the first half of the 1980s was crucial for this integration, fostering the emergence of genomics and ultimately the Human Genome Project.","340":"Since the emergence of \"literary criticism\" as a university subject in the 1880s, there have been those prepared to challenge its disciplinary status. How can something as subjective as literature be taught, let alone examined? Throughout the 20th century, the success of the sciences fostered methodological anxieties, resulting in several efforts from within the humanities to set the study of literary texts on a more scientific footing. In recent years, this scientisation of the study of literature has increasingly come from outside the humanities, as cognitive scientists and evolutionary psychologists expand their efforts to explain culture in terms of biology. So where does this leave \"lit crit\"?","341":"After a wave of earthquakes in 1692 and 1693, the astronomer John Flamsteed composed an innovative explanation of their causes. He argued that they did not originate underground but were caused by explosions of nitrous and sulphurous particles in the air. Although the idea now sounds strange, Flamsteed's account was expressed in terms that were familiar to his contemporaries in the Royal Society, drawing particularly on Boyle's chemistry and air-pressure experiments. Flamsteed was more unusual in his conviction that the earth was virtually solid; this made him an opponent of structural theories offered by Thomas Burnet, Robert Hooke and Edmond Halley. Flamsteed's ideas were dismissed by Hooke as 'nonsensicall', but by the time they were published, long after his death, they appeared closer to mainstream thinking.","342":"Every schoolchild learns that, under standard pressure, pure water always boils at 100 degrees C. Except that it does not. By the late 18th century, pioneering scientists had already discovered great variations in the boiling temperature of water under fixed pressure. So, why have most of us been taught that the boiling point of water is constant? And, if it is not constant, how can it be used as a 'fixed point' for the calibration of thermometers? History of science has the answers.","343":"The small flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is the best-studied model organism in plant biology. More resources are allocated to research on this little weed than to the study of well-known favourites such as worms, fruit flies and mice. Yet, up to the early 1980s plant biologists had every good reason to ignore Arabidopsis: neither did it seem to possess the characteristics of a good model organism, nor did it have any agricultural promise. The sudden prestige acquired by Arabidopsis research thus constitutes a remarkable historical puzzle. What made the mouse cress into the most successful model organism to date?","344":"A close associate of the Lunar Society, Joseph Wright of Derby painted several industrial and scientific scenes. This article (part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) shows how two of his works - featuring an orrery and an alchemist - reveal the ideas and aspirations of the provincial philosophers who made up the Society.","345":"The Census of Marine Life is an international and inter-disciplinary collaboration that seeks to map ocean life of the past, present and future. From the Arctic to the abyssal zones, it is producing a stream of newsworthy science, literally pushing the study of biodiversity to new depths. This fascinating and far-reaching endeavour offers a rich set of insights that can illuminate our changing ideas about the oceans. But one section of the Census deserves special attention--the History of Marine Animal Populations. It provides a unique focus for debates about collaboration and big science, about historical methods and about the study of current science by historians of science.","346":"With the arrival of steam power and new machinery in the 19th century, the production of printed media was transformed for the first time since the emergence of the printing press more than 300 years earlier. Yet until the 1850s, most publishers remained content with traditional methods, which enabled them to make profits from a small but affluent circle of readers. This article (part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) will show how William Chambers (1800-1883) was one of the first to make full use of the new technologies. He was driven by a determination to reach readers of all social classes, to produce a genuinely cheap instructive publication and to overcome the challenges of reaching a national market from his base in Edinburgh.","347":"The history of flight has been strongly influenced by the interplay between physiology and technology. The human body defined the relationship between man and machine--it had to be protected from the cold, bad weather, high altitude, speed and bullets. Technological innovations offered a way to improve on aeroplane safety, and enabled pilots to exceed the limits imposed by physiological constraints. In particular, reconnaissance and bombing missions during World War II, which demanded flight at high altitudes, stimulated intensive scientific research and technological development. This research led to the construction of artificial environments for pilots and ultimately gave rise to space medicine.","348":"Thin at one end, thicker in the middle, then thin again at the other end, Brontosaurus is one of the most famous dinosaurs. So why do paleontologists call it Apatosaurus? Othniel Charles Marsh coined both names from two relatively complete specimens in the late 1870s. Additional specimens collected during the second American Jurassic dinosaur rush (1895-1905) provided the material for revisions. Henry Fairfield Osborn, who detested Marsh, systematically sought to overturn his work. Yet it was Elmer Samuel Riggs who showed that Marsh's Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are synonymous, and Osborn who stubbornly, and inexplicably, adhered to the latter.","349":"While dredging in the Aegean Sea during the mid-19th century, Manxman Edward Forbes noticed that plants and animals became progressively more impoverished the greater the depth they were from the surface of the water. By extrapolation Forbes proposed his now infamous azoic hypothesis, namely that life would be extinguished altogether in the murky depths of the deep ocean. The whole idea seemed so entirely logical given the enormous pressure, cold and eternal darkness of this apparently uninhabitable environment. Yet we now know that the sea floor is teeming with life. Curiously, it took 25 years for the azoic hypothesis to fall from grace. This was despite the presence of ample contrary evidence, including starfishes, worms and other organisms that seemingly originated from the deep seabed. This is a tale of scientists ignoring observations that ran counter to their deep-seated, yet entirely erroneous, beliefs.","350":"During World War I, military officers encountered a new and puzzling phenomenon: soldiers emerged from the trenches stuttering, crying, trembling and at times were even paralysed and blind. Those in charge were convinced these soldiers were cowards or malingerers who deserved stern discipline or to be court-martialled. A number of physicians, by contrast, initially assumed that these alarming symptoms resulted from close exposure to explosions and called it shell shock. Later, they realized that it was a psychological reaction and came up with psychotherapeutic treatments. But it was only in World War II that military psychiatrists, particularly those in the USA, began to implement treatment methods for this phenomenon in a systematic way. Their thinking and the treatments they devised had significant consequences for the future of American psychiatry, which in turn influenced the development of psychiatry and military psychiatry world-wide.","351":"From 1816 onwards, London theatres began to install gas-lighting systems to replace candles. In addition to allowing theatre managers to adjust the level of illumination, gas lights offered greater brightness and visibility for the audience. Actors had to adjust to this new level of exposure that threatened their ability to \"look the part.\" Until this illuminating moment, there had been little need for makeup and actors to adhere to the principles of physiognomy--a system that correlated character traits to facial features. Under the new harsh glare of the gas lights, both the faces of the actors and the theatres themselves were found wanting.","352":"Long-neglected by scholars, the pulp science fiction (SF) magazines of the Gernsback era (1926-1937) are due for re-examination. Presumed to be sub-literary stories for boys or, paradoxically, escapist leisure reading for practicing scientists and technicians, the SF from this period is actually neither. It is a powerful resource for understanding the ways ordinary people engaged with the promise and peril of industrial modernity. Published by a passionate entrepreneur seeking fame and fortune, composed by writers paid piecework rates and read by young science and technology enthusiasts aspiring to authentic remunerative work, the earliest pulp SF necessarily provoked inter-class discussions about labor, management, production and consumption.","353":"In 1873, Darwin replied to the second letter from a young Dutch admirer, Nicolaas Doedes, in which he had eagerly asked about Darwin's religious views. Darwin stated that he could not believe that \"this grand and wondrous universe\" had only arisen by chance, but also showed his doubts about the existence of God. In 1881, Darwin repeated a similar agnostic view. After the death of Darwin in 1882, Doedes incurred the wrath of Francis Darwin by publishing the confession of his father in a Dutch freethinking journal, thus revealing the sensitivity of the information Darwin shared with Doedes.","354":"The industrialization and urbanization of Britain during the 19th century gave the medical profession something to think about. In particular, were the radical changes taking place in society responsible for the sudden rise in endemic and epidemic disease? This article (part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) examines the reactions of two key figures in the history of British public health, James Philips Kay and Thomas Southwood Smith, to this question. Their outlooks typify the tendency of Victorian medical practitioners to construct economies of health that saw disease as a consequence of the violation of natural laws and cycles rather than as a product of industrial modernity.","355":"The Grand Canyon is a vast place. It is almost incomprehensible in size. And yet it can also seem strangely crowded. Millions of tourists flock to the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona every year. In 1999, almost 5 million people visited, the highest figure in Canyon history. And each one of them expected to see a wild, free and untrammelled landscape. Despite the obvious natural resources, this expectation has proved anything but easy to satisfy. The US National Park Service (NPS), responsible for the management of most large North American parks (along with several historic sites and museums), has struggled to make or keep the canyon \"grand\". Park rangers have grappled with a multitude of issues during the past century, including automobile congestion, drying of the Colorado River and uranium mining inside the park. Conservation has posed a unique set of challenges. On a fundamental level, \"restoring\" the Grand Canyon to its \"original\" wilderness setting has proved intensely problematic. In the field of wildlife management, restoring the Canyon to its pre-Columbian splendour has entailed some tough decisions--none more so than a 1976 plan to eliminate a sizeable population of feral burros (wild donkeys) roaming the preserve, animals classified as exotics by the NPS.","356":null,"357":null,"358":"High hopes for opening new markets, locating natural resources and the 'advance of civilisation' were built into the plans for Victorian expeditions to Africa. When an expedition failed to deliver on these goals, criticisms of individual explorers and the entire 'civilising mission' project could result. The Zambesi Expedition, led by David Livingstone, received just such criticism when politics and geography obstructed the realisation of its aims. The needs of a growing industrial sector contributed to the organisation of the Expedition but also set the criteria by which its success or failure would be judged.","359":"In the early nineteenth century, geology was a new but rapidly growing science, in the provinces and among the gentlemen scientists of London, Oxford and Cambridge. Industry, particularly mining, often motivated local practical geologists, and the construction of canals and railways exposed the strata for all to see. The most notable of the early practical men of geology was the mineral surveyor William Smith; his geological map of England and Wales, published in 1815, was the first of its kind. He was not alone. The contributions of professional men, and the provincial societies with which they were connected, are sometimes underestimated in the history of geology.","360":"Computer climate models are some of the most complex scientific structures ever conceived. Consisting of hundreds of thousands of equations and running on supercomputers capable of trillions of operations per second, they chart the evolution of past and future climates across thousands of years. These simulations are breathtaking in their qualitative detail and vastly ambitious in their quantitative exactitude. However, their progress has recently been challenged by the very size and complexity of the models, factors that are also paralleled in the communities of scientists that build them. This complex co-evolution of computers and scientific communities gives us insight into the promise and limits of sciences driven by exponential increases in computing power.","361":"The Swedish 18th-century naturalist Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus is habitually credited with laying the foundations of modern taxonomy through the invention of binominal nomenclature. However, another innovation of Linnaeus' has largely gone unnoticed. He seems to have been one of the first botanists to leave his herbarium unbound, keeping the sheets of dried plants separate and stacking them in a purpose built-cabinet. Understanding the significance of this seemingly mundane and simple invention opens a window onto the profound changes that natural history underwent in the 18th century.","362":"Isambard Kingdom Brunel learnt the arts of self-promotion from his father, but triumphant images of him conceal failures and disappointments. This article (part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) focuses on his first and last great engineering projects--the Thames Tunnel and the Great Eastern steam-ship.","363":"Almost from its beginnings in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) set up a life-science program. Because one of the priorities of the organization is to search for life beyond Earth, NASA began designing spacecraft to unravel the mysteries of Mars. The effort to search for life on Mars culminated in the landing of two Viking spacecraft on the surface of the planet in 1976. Although the biology experiments conducted as part of these missions provided some evidence for the possibility of life, the scientific consensus was that they drew a blank. In 1996, however, the 'Mars rock' rekindled interest in life in our solar system. The discovery of an ocean on the Jovian moon Europa, of organic molecules on the Saturnian moon Titan and persuasive evidence that water once flowed on Mars suggests that the solar system is still of considerable exobiological interest. In addition, since 1995 approximately 175 planets have been found beyond our solar system. Although these discoveries are gas giants, NASA spacecraft might soon detect Earth-sized planets. The search for life in the universe continues.","364":"Sigmund Freud claimed to hate being photographed, yet he carefully fashioned his public image. Always immaculately dressed, he sported an old-fashioned beard that helped to establish his status as the founding father of psychoanalysis. An avid collector, Freud chose objects for their symbolic as well as their aesthetic interest.","365":"The phenomenon of industrial melanism is the preeminent example of natural selection in textbooks and the popular media. Much of its fame stems from a set of pioneering and apparently definitive investigations by H.B.D. 'Bernard' Kettlewell in the early 1950s. There is a marked contrast in how the phenomenon and Kettlewell's work on it are perceived by the public and scientists. Tensions between these two perceptions have recently led to calls for the removal of the example from textbooks, and indeed allegations that Kettlewell committed fraud. This article (part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) will show that these charges are baseless and stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of science as a process.","366":"","367":"Most scientists at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century chose to ignore the question of the origin of life on Earth, regarding it as too mysterious and complex to handle. Yet, in the early 1950s an experimental field devoted to the study of the problem made its first steps. The pioneering theories of several scientists in the first decades of the 20th century played a major role in this transformation, notably those of the Russian biochemist Alexander I. Oparin and the British geneticist and biochemist J.B.S. Haldane. The ideas of the lesser-known American psycho-physiologist Leonard Troland also made a significant contribution to subsequent developments in origin-of-life research. Therefore, it is well worth taking a look at the professional, philosophical and ideological commitments that shaped the approaches of the three scientists to origin-of-life research.","368":"Appreciating pictures entails a consideration not only of the people, objects and landscape that their artists have chosen to portray, but also an imagining of what has been excluded. The term 'Industrial Revolution' has been given multiple meanings, and this article (part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) explores some of these by exposing the messages concealed inside some of the most enduring images of the Revolution.","369":"Anatomical waxworks lay at the centre of a composite world of social interaction in mid-18th-century Bologna. Sponsored by Pope Benedict XIV and included among Grand Tour attractions, they earned fame and authority for wax-modellers such as Anna Morandi, Giovanni Manzolini and Ercole Lelli. By dissecting bodies, making waxwork models of them and demonstrating their anatomical collections, these artificers became protagonists of the world of anatomy. Offering representations of the inner body some thought more faithful than the real thing, their collections gave expression to a new set of relations between the role of artefacts in the production and communication of knowledge, the emergence of new apparatuses for viewing and investigating the human body, the legacy of codified visual conventions and the authenticating power of natural spectacle.","370":"The sea monster played an important part in launching the Danish Galathea Deep Sea Expedition of 1950-1952. Part scientific object, part media darling and part fundraising strategy, the sea monster brought scientists, journalists and politicians together in support of the expedition. The scientific leader of the expedition, Anton F. Bruun, contended the scientific reality of such a creature; the leader of the press section attached to the expedition, Hakon Mielche, dreamt of the grand headlines finding the sea monster would attract; and everyone involved used the 'poor little thing' to promote the expedition to sponsors and in public.","371":"Michael Faraday was an enthusiastic portrait collector, and he welcomed the invention of photography not only as a possible means of recording observations accurately, but also as a method for advertising science and its practitioners. This article (which is part of the Science in the Industrial Revolution series) shows that like many eminent scientists, Faraday took advantage of the burgeoning Victorian media industry by posing in various roles.","372":"Futurist writing about technology emerged in the late 19th century at the same time as new kinds of electrical technology were making utopian futures seem practically attainable. Electrical writers and novelists alike thus borrowed from the popular \"science\" fiction of Jules Verne, Edward Bellamy and others to try to create self-fulfilling prophecies of a future in which electrical gadgets and machines met all major practical needs of civilization. To the extent that many parts of our world are populated by the hardware that they forecast, they succeeded in their goal.","373":"The reputations of scientific heroes shift constantly, modified by politicians as well as by historians. Now that the Scientific Revolution has been reappraised, Nicolas Copernicus is portrayed as a friend of the Catholic Church rather than a scientific martyr. As a German-speaking Pole he has been claimed as a figure of national historical importance by both Germany and Poland, and since the early 20th century has been an important symbol of Polish independence.","374":"The \"Lysenko affair\", which lasted roughly from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, was the big scandal of 20th-century science: a classic example of how politics can corrupt and undermine its rational basis. Under Stalin's leadership the Soviet Government suppressed genuine genetics and other sound biology, with devastating consequences for agriculture and health. The worst example of this occurred in August 1948 when the Politburo outlawed the teaching of and research into classical Mendelian genetics. There is broad agreement that this case offers a stark warning against politicians interfering with science. But what, precisely, is this interference that we are being warned about? Whereas the fate of genetics in Soviet Russia was a clear-cut example of direct suppression, there were also other less obvious ways in which politics subverted the scientific process. This indirect interference with science is a persistent feature of modern politics that we need to be on the lookout for.","375":"World War II became known as the \"wizard war\" because the cycles of developing countermeasures and counter-countermeasures to the weapons deployed by all sides drove rapid technological change. However, technological innovation was not the only contribution scientists made to the war effort. Through Operational Research (OR)--the scientific scrutiny of new weapons, their deployment and relative efficiency--scientists also influenced how warfare itself was conducted. This new scientific field emerged in the UK, where it helped to tighten the defense against the Luftwaffe. It quickly spread to other aspects of the military machine, improving both antisubmarine campaigns and bombing strategy. But although this analytical approach to warfare offered military commanders a factual basis on which to base difficult decisions and deal with tactical and strategic uncertainty, it was not without controversy. Indeed, several recommendations that came out of OR sparked disputes over the allocation of resources and strategic priorities.","376":"Paul Kammerer's career ended in scandal in 1926 over tampering with his evidence for \"Lamarckian\" evolution--the infamous midwife toad. But although Kammerer's conclusions proved false, his evidence was probably genuine. In any case his arguments were not simply for Lamarckism and against Darwinism, as the theories are understood today. If we look beyond the scandal, the Kammerer story shows us a great deal about early 20th-century biology: the range of new ideas about heredity and variation, competing theories of biological and cultural evolution and their applications in eugenics, new kinds of laboratories and professional roles for biologists, and changing standards for documenting experimental results.","377":"Histories of evolutionary thought are dominated by organic evolution. The colossus in our midst that is evolutionary biology casts its shadow over history, making it appear that what is so widespread and important today was always the primary subject of evolutionary speculation. Thus many histories assume that the core meaning of evolution is the change of organic life and that other forms of evolutionary thinking, such as linguistic, social or cultural evolution, are only analogies or offshoots of the main biological evolutionary trunk. Ironically this is an ahistorical understanding. Long before the work of Charles Darwin, scholars were independently developing evolutionary concepts such as descent with modification and divergence from a common stock in order to understand cultural change.","378":"With their mythical creatures and arcane symbolism, coats of arms seem to have little connection with modern science. Yet despite its chivalric origins, the ancient language of heraldry has long fascinated famous scientists. Although this idiosyncratic tradition was parodied by Victorian geologists, who laughingly replaced unicorns and griffins with images of dinosaurs that they had recently discovered, it has been perpetuated since by Ernest Rutherford, who liked to present himself as a new alchemist.","379":"The story of how World War II stimulated the development of DDT, and the ensuing postwar dependence on such chemical insecticides, is well known. However, less recognition has been given to the wartime efforts to synthesize new rodenticides to fight rat-borne epidemics. Baltimore, Maryland served as the site for field tests of the powerful new compound alpha naphthyl thiourea (ANTU) from 1942-1946. This experimental campaign sparked debates over the efficacy of controlling rats via chemical warfare instead of environmental sanitation, which led to the ironic conclusion that urban rat control demanded an ecological, rather than technological, approach.","380":"The early history of \"DNA fingerprinting\" in the UK might have been different were it not for the accounts of two dramatic courtroom trials, made by the participants and the media, in the mid-1980s. But these reports, which misrepresented the importance DNA evidence had in the trials, left a strong impression on the British public and on judges on both sides of the Atlantic. These trials, widely considered to be the first \"victories\" for DNA fingerprinting, have been frequently cited as proof of the utility and reliability of the technique, in both the UK and beyond. But in reality, it was the threat of DNA evidence being used rather than the integrity or validity of it that resolved these cases. At that time, DNA fingerprinting was still in its infancy, an untried and untested technology.","381":"","382":"How can a natural history collection be turned into an instrument of public education? What should an institution serving such a purpose look like? Everyday scenes from the Royal Museum of Physics and Natural History in Florence, founded in 1775, highlight the practical problems with transforming a museum in such a fashion. Naturalists employed at the Royal Museum took measures to control both its \"frontstage\" (the public exhibition) and its \"backstage\" (the offices and workshops) in an effort to secure the integrity of the educational and scientific mission of the new institution.","383":"When Peter Scott became chairman of the Survival Service Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in 1963, he invited Archie Carr to chair the Marine Turtle Group (MTG). A leading authority on the ecology and conservation of sea turtles, Carr believed that the MTG could be the first international forum for sea turtle research and conservation. The assembly of data for the IUCN Red Data Book revealed which species of turtles were threatened with extinction and the array of risks that they faced. Although Carr and Scott differed on what courses of action should be taken in light of this, the MTG did emerge as an important international congress that remains an inspiration to current marine protection efforts.","384":"In 1886 William T. Hornaday, the Chief Taxidermist of the US National Museum, led the \"Smithsonian Institution Buffalo Outfit\" to Montana. The American bison was fast heading toward extinction and the mission of the expedition was to locate those of the elusive animals that remained and obtain specimens for the scientific collection at the museum. The successful expedition produced the most complete scientific series, and the finest artistic grouping of taxidermied specimens of the American bison anywhere in the world. Haunted by the scattered skeletal remains of the millions of slaughtered bison that peppered the Eastern Montana Plains, Hornaday fought to establish the National Zoological Park, which would provide sanctuary for bison and other endangered species, and a captive breeding program, which would result in the eventual reintroduction of the American bison to the wild.","385":"The stereotypical scientist wears a lab-coat, is often eccentric and is usually male. Images of female scientists in popular culture remain rare. Some of the first portrayals of women in science occurred in a handful of British films made during the 1950s and 1960s. These films reflected the difficulties experienced by women in science at the time, but they might also explain why representations of female scientists in film continue to downplay their role as scientists and emphasize their identity as women.","386":"A century before the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Great Britain and North America grappled with pleuro-pneumonia - a disease in cattle that had equally maddening consequences. Towards the end of the 19th century, this condition was at the heart of a transatlantic trade dispute that lasted for decades and attracted the attention of livestock farmers, diplomats, shipping moguls, veterinarians, public health regulators and journalists the world over. Scientific controversy aggravated the situation when there were doubts about the scientific judgment of Privy Council veterinary officials, who were simultaneously conducting disease-diagnosis activities and pushing for tighter regulations at British ports. At this point, William Williams, principal of the New Veterinary College in Edinburgh, waded into this troubled arena. His strong convictions spawned a long-running disagreement with the British Government over the diagnoses of pleuro-pneumonia in cattle imported from the USA and Canada.","387":"Before canals and railways developed as a major transport network, it was seldom profitable to transport beer inland over more than a few miles. In country towns and villages, therefore, beer would be brewed either by a small 'common' brewery that supplied a handful of pubs and private customers, or in an even smaller brew-house attached to the pub itself. Many families also brewed their own beer. However, large-scale mass-production did make sense in the major urban centres - and above all in London, with its ever-growing, thirsty population. Over the course of the 18th century, a handful of London breweries began to boast plants, outputs and distribution systems far greater than anything previously in existence.","388":"By the late-19th century, evolutionary theory, known by most people as Darwinism, had earned a reputation as an atheistic theory that challenged religious orthodoxy. From recent historical work we now know a great deal about how those with religious convictions received Darwinian ideas, and the role that professional scientists played in styling and communicating 'Darwinism' to the wider public and between themselves. However, relatively little is known about how Darwinian ideas were received and used by avowedly irreligious groups, and how these groups set about communicating their own version of Darwinism to a public hungry for cheap and accessible science. The activities of the Secularist Edward Bibbins Aveling, a prolific popularizer of Darwinian ideas in the late-19th century, offer a unique insight into this relatively uncharted territory. His work helped to develop the polemic of popular irreligious groups and imbue Darwinism with overtly atheistic connotations; it also engendered unprecedented support for atheism from the general public, and challenged the monopoly that some professional scientists enjoyed over imparting serious scientific knowledge to them.","389":"The voyage of the HMS Rattlesnake to New Guinea and the archipelago to the east of it could have achieved so much for science. 'Make sure of what you do', enthused British hydrographer Francis Beaufort to the Rattlesnake's commander Owen Stanley in 1848. 'Do not leave interesting questions to be answered at the next visit - give names to Capes and Islands...and bring yourself and your people back without quarrels'. But for some reason Stanley wavered. There were several scientists on board the Rattlesnake desperate to ask interesting questions of these uncharted islands. But these natural historians, and in particular a young Thomas Henry Huxley, found their ambitions thwarted by their increasingly edgy captain.","390":"","391":"","392":"The changing fate of group selection theory illustrates nicely the importance of studying the history of science. It was Charles Darwin that first used something like group selection to explain how natural selection could give rise to altruistic behavior and moral instinct. These instincts could be accommodated by his theory of evolution, he argued, if they had evolved 'for the good of the community'. By the 1960s, group selection had a new and vocal advocate in V.C. Wynne-Edwards. But this gave critics of the theory that selection might act on groups, rather than at the level of individuals or genes, a definable target, and from the mid-1960s to the 1980s group selection was considered the archetypal example of flawed evolutionary thinking. However, at the end of the 20th century ideas of group selection re-emerged as an important component of a multilevel theory of evolution.","393":"The 19th century saw the advent of the modern zoological garden. The newly founded zoos not only claimed to educate and entertain their audiences, but also to serve science by providing direct access to exotic animals. However, reality did not live up to the promise of such rhetoric. The vast majority of biologists preferred to use dead bodies as the material for their morphological research. Nevertheless, there was still a strong interaction between the zoo and science. In the debate on Darwinism, the apes in the cage played a vital role.","394":"Carl Schmidt is one of the founders of modern biochemistry. He wrote numerous scientific publications, and left future generations several important documents that included two extensive hand-written travel reports from 1857 and 1864. In these, Schmidt paints a lively and impressive picture of industry in Victorian Britain from a personal perspective, showing this key period of European economic history in a unique light. Thus, it is rewarding to follow Schmidt on his travels through Britain, which he regarded as the workshop of the world and a shining but unattainable example for the industrial development of his home country.","395":"The fossil hunter Mary Anning began collecting her 'curiosities' at a time when the age and nature of these relics from the past were little understood. Her spectacular discoveries of prehistoric marine reptiles, fossilized fish and a pterosaur touched off a geology-mania around the world. Two documents that have escaped previous analysis cast light on the religious journey of this remarkable woman. An eight-page manuscript at the Natural History Museum in London indicates a fascination with Benjamin West's painting 'Christ Rejected' and sophistication in Biblical interpretation; and a commonplace book at the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester tracks the shift in her Christian denomination from dissent to the Established Church, providing further indication of her spiritual depth - a piety that furthered, rather than hindered, her scientific progress.","396":"Caroline Herschel was famous in her own time as the discoverer of eight comets, but of even greater significance was the help she gave her brother William in his exploration of 'the construction of the heavens'. She acted as his amanuensis during night watches, wrote up neat copies of their observing records and prepared his papers for publication. She also compiled an index to John Flamsteed's Star Catalogue, which was published by the Royal Society at its own expense, and after William's death she reorganized his catalogues of nebulae so that his son John could revise his father's work. Yet Caroline's was a hard and largely loveless life, for which she found the recognition that came her way a scant consolation.","397":"In the middle of the 17th century, two founding fellows of the Royal Society -- John Evelyn and William Petty -- commissioned portraits of themselves with skulls. The paintings were commemorative, because Evelyn was celebrating his engagement and Petty had recently acquired an anatomical post at Oxford, but both sitters also intended their pictures to serve as reminders of mortality.","398":"Country houses have long acted as scholarly research centres, and the contents and organization of their libraries reveal how knowledge was created and transmitted through scientific networks: they provide material evidence of intellectual and social cultures. Manuscripts are particularly appreciated in this regard because they are unique, but individual books also differ and copies of the same book are not always identical -- they might be annotated by authors and readers, and the printed text can vary as well -- so they also carry invaluable historical information. When libraries are broken up, access to the past is permanently blocked.","399":"","400":"The case of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics (KWIA), from its inception in Weimar Republic Germany to its apogee under the rule of the Third Reich, is an example of how politics and human heredity can function as mutually beneficial resources. Whether it was a result of the Nazi bureaucrats' desire to legitimize their racial policy through science, or the KWIA personnel's desire to secure more funding for their research, the symbiotic relationship that developed between human genetics and Nazi politics could help explain why many scientists in the Third Reich undertook research projects that wholly transgressed the boundaries of morally acceptable science.","401":"Both Danish and English agriculture underwent fundamental restructuring during the second half of the 19th century, and in both cases the dairy sector made great advances. However, the two agricultural industries differed in aims and strategies, and crucially in the extent to which new technologies and scientific methods were implemented. Economic historical analysis is insufficient to explain why the Danish and English dairy industries developed in different ways, and how Danish butter achieved success in the competitive English market. However, with a focus on the role of science and a scientific understanding of the development of these two dairy industries, all becomes clear.","402":"The search by naturalists for good characters upon which to base both classifications and determinations of species led some 19th century entomologists to put their faith in insect genitalia as a criteria by which they could differentiate between and classify forms. Karl Jordan was such an entomologist, who turned to these tiny structures as an aid to his work as a museum curator to identify, describe and classify moths and butterflies. In his writings on the subject he also demonstrated how the attempts of systematists to order the diversity of nature had profound implications for the efforts of biologists to explain the origin of that diversity. However, Jordan's plan of how to do systematics well required much more than convincing biologists of the importance of museum work. It also depended on refining the priorities of a natural history community that worked according to diverse means, priorities and methods during a tumultuous century.","403":"The English translation of Pierre Pomet's A Compleat History of Druggs (1712) demonstrates how the expansion of print culture altered the way that scientific ideas were communicated. Although it makes utilitarian claims, the text of the History departs from the style of contemporary British pharmacopoeias by emphasizing the exotic aspects of drugs. In this sense, the text exemplifies how Enlightenment science could be sold to a cross-over audience interested as much in the fantastical as in the quality and operation of drugs.","404":"The hot-air balloon, invented by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783, enabled the French King to project his glory, the nobility to exhibit their valor, the literary public to transmit the ideal of the Enlightenment and the plebian public to rejoice in a scientific spectacle. The ensuing balloon mania helped create an integrated public that, because of its size and composition, can only be described as 'democratic' just a few years before the French Revolution. The monumental impact of the balloon was well represented in a flood of poetry, pamphlets, books, journal reports, academic papers and consumer items. Sifting through these artifacts and considering the crowd that witnessed the ascent of the balloon will bring us to the historical moment when things, spectacles, and events (rather than words) shaped public and popular opinion.","405":"Enlightenment natural philosophers were linked to one another in an extended correspondence network, but the female participants in this international Republic of Letters are rarely mentioned. Gottfried Leibniz relied on several such women not only for financial patronage, but also for intellectual stimulation. Although this hardworking and underpaid librarian at the Hanoverian Court is now one of the world's most famous mathematical philosophers, the women on whom he depended for ideas as well as support have been largely forgotten.","406":"","407":"The 1963 LINC (Laboratory INstrument Computer) stands at the center of two stories: the computerization of the biologist's laboratory and the advent of small-scale computing. The brainchild of Wesley Clark, 'the most brilliant computer designer of his generation', LINC was developed specifically to address the failure of biologists to adopt computer technology. To meet their unique needs, Clark built a machine the radical design of which defied and subverted the then dominant conventions of computer architecture.","408":"Science communicators must learn from science educators in their crusade to counteract the traditional boring and inefficient approaches to convey science. Educators encounter a need for methods of teaching that portray science as 'hard fun' and resources that encourage students' minds to burst into action. Narratives are considered by several authors as highly valuable resources for science education. However, little research has been undertaken to measure the efficiency of narratives in the context of science communication to the general public. Recent work however, suggests that narratives are indeed an alternative and an important means for science communication to convey information in an accurate, attractive, imaginative and memorable way. To present scientific information through stories, novels, comics and plays should be regarded as an important means to transmit information in the repertoire of both science teachers and science communicators.","409":"The experiences of the 22 men from Ernest Shackleton's Endurance expedition of 1914-1916 who were marooned on Elephant Island during the Antarctic winter are not as well known as the narrative of the ship being beset and sunk, and Shackleton's open boat journey to South Georgia to rescue them. Frank Wild was left in charge of the marooned men by Shackleton and saved them from starvation and despair. The morale of the men in the face of extreme exposure to the elements, the ingenuity of their devices for survival and their diet, conversation and entertainments all reveal heroic qualities of Shackletonian endurance.","410":"The 'Heroic Age' of Antarctic exploration, which occurred during the first 15 years of the 20th century, captured headlines around the world. Australia was no exception, especially as Australian scientists played important roles in several expeditions. Through participation in the British Antarctic Expedition of 1907-1909, two Australian scientists - T.W. Edgeworth David (1858-1934) and Douglas Mawson (1882-1958) - became genuine national heroes, mainly through being members of the first party to reach the South Magnetic Pole area. At a superficial level, the vehicle of Antarctic exploration placed science at the forefront of public awareness, fulfilling David's ambition for greater recognition of science and scientists, especially considering the high level of public interest in sport. However, although David and Mawson gave Antarctic exploration a scientific veneer, simply through their status as scientists, the public viewed them as heroes because they had endured great hardships and conquered a point on the map in the name of science and the Empire.","411":"Sherlock Holmes was intended by his creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, to be a 'scientific detective'. Conan Doyle criticized his predecessor Edgar Allan Poe for giving his creation - Inspector Dupin - only the 'illusion' of scientific method. Conan Doyle believed that he had succeeded where Poe had failed; thus, he has Watson remark that Holmes has 'brought detection as near an exact science as it will ever be brought into the world.' By examining Holmes' methods, it becomes clear that Conan Doyle modelled them on certain images of science that were popular in mid- to late-19th century Britain. Contrary to a common view, it is also evident that rather than being responsible for the invention of forensic science, the creation of Holmes was influenced by the early development of it.","412":"Marie Curie challenged many conventions when she left Poland, became a world-famous French scientist and took X-ray machinery to the front line in World War I. Although she was the first person to win two Nobel prizes, many critics found it hard to believe that she could simultaneously be a caring mother and a brilliant researcher. As mythological accounts of Curie's success grew, photographs and caricatures of her reinforced traditional stereotypes of male and female roles in science.","413":"An understanding of historical relations between gender and nature, whether within the context of 'untouched wilderness' or the pulsating vibrancy of the industrial city, is central to collective self-knowledge in the world in which we all live. However, have British historians been less successful than their American counterparts in engaging with key aspects of the environmental past?","414":"","415":"Statisticians R.A. Fisher and Joseph Berkson have become infamous for ending up on the \"wrong\" side of the debate over the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer during the 1950s, and scholars have speculated about their personal motives in the controversy. But there were many senior biostatisticians and epidemiologists voicing similar concerns about the quality of the evidence at the time, albeit with less inflammatory rhetoric. This debate occurred during a time when epidemiological research methods commonly used today were understood by few and were only just beginning to work their way into public health and medicine. All of the participants in the debate over smoking and lung cancer saw the need for explicit and rigorous standards for evaluating etiological hypotheses, but they held conflicting views about what those standards should be. The differing opinions on the evidence reflected two different models of etiological research--controlled experiment as the crucial, objective test of a causal hypothesis versus inferential judgment based on a diverse body of evidence. This debate has relevance for current epidemiological practice, as tension between these two views still remains.","416":"In many ways, Tahiti was central to European colonialism, for it was there that European visitors forged a model of primitive nature that served as a comparison to, and sometimes critique of, European civilization. Tahiti was also the place from which a unique plant, the breadfruit, was brought to European colonies and to England and France during the late 18th century, at the behest of naturalists. With the breadfruit travelled contrasting perceptions of the Tahitian way of life. The autocritique of European lifestyles and the naturalization of the breadfruit are closely intertwined. The breadfruit indeed became a radical food of the end of the 18th century.","417":"Discovery of the Periodic Table was rendered possible only after four decisive prerequisites had been achieved. These were (i) the abandonment of the metaphysical and occult notions of elements that typified the alchemical era; (ii) the adoption of a modern and workable definition of an element; (iii) the development of analytical chemical techniques for the isolation of the elements and determination of their properties; and (iv) the devising of a means of associating each element with a characteristic natural number. The Periodic Table made its appearance on cue almost as soon as these preconditions had been fulfilled.","418":"In their race to provide the ultimate guide to the moon, two 17th-century astronomers proposed lunar maps and nomenclatures that they hoped would gain international currency. But the names we use today were those proposed by the Jesuit, a friend of Galileo's persecutors, in a book whose purpose was to refute the Copernican system once and for all. We now believe that Riccioli was wrong about the universe, but why do we still use his nomenclature? The keys to this foundational visual debate in astronomical image-making are the moon maps themselves.","419":"","420":"","421":"","422":"","423":"At the turn of the 19th century, a surprisingly dense network of academic institutes and medical facilities developed on the margins of Ringstrasse, the impressive boulevard that surrounded the old city of Vienna. Enmeshed, socially and culturally in the life of the city, that area known as the Mediziner-Viertel grew out of the needs of natural scientists and physicians as much as it was shaped by the liberal ideology, feminists' petitions for women's acceptance to university studies, Vienna's intellectuals and Kaffeehaus culture. Recovering the city behind the structure of modern academic institutes tells us a good deal about the context in which intellectual work was developed and its impact on the production of scientific knowledge.","424":"Mary Everest Boole had a lifelong interest in the unconscious mind, the psychology of learning, and how these relate to the teaching of mathematics and science. She recommended many practical exercises and teaching aids, one of which was the technique of curve stitching, which she had invented while still a child herself.","425":"Gershwin's song 'I Got Rhythm' serves here as a backdrop representing the social context of the inter-war years. On center stage is a particular aspect of the history of birth control--the application of a new theory of ovulation to contraception. Starting in 1928, a series of experiments revealed a biochemical rhythm in the female reproductive cycle, which contradicted the widespread idea that ovulation and pregnancy could occur at any time. This discovery was applied to a new contraceptive method, the rhythm method, which enjoyed significant popularity during the 1930s, especially among Catholics. For a short period, women could join Ethel Merman in the refrain 'I got rhythm, I got my man, who could ask for anything more?' But the rhythm method has not lived to its promise, and the play goes on em leader","426":"In 1946 three Americans shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry--James Sumner 'for his discovery that enzymes can be crystallized', and John Northrop and Wendell Stanley 'for their preparation of enzymes and virus proteins in a pure form'. The award made history as the first time that the Chemistry Prize was shared by three individuals. It also doubled the number of Americans that had received the Chemistry award since its inception in 1901.","427":"Francis Baily's publication of the manuscripts of John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, provoked a furious response. Flamsteed had quarrelled with Isaac Newton, and described him in terms unforgivable to those who claimed him as a paragon of all virtues, both moral and scientific. Baily was condemned for putting Flamsteed's complaints in the public sphere. However, his supporters saw his work as a critique of the excessive hero-worship accorded to Newton. Written when the word 'scientist' had been newly coined, this work and the debates it provoked gives us an insight into contemporary views of the role of the man of science and of the use of science to back political, religious and moral positions.","428":"Throughout the 20th century, scientists developed a variety of chemical compounds to kill insects and other menaces of agriculture and public health. Yet, in many cases, the target insects outmaneuvered the scientists by developing resistance to insecticides--in much the same way as some bacteria can tolerate antibiotics. Insecticide resistance research has involved scientists from a range of disciplines and a variety of institutional contexts that have often guided research strategy. For example, entomologists working at agricultural stations and universities concentrated on insect physiology and evolutionary genetics, while industrial chemists continued the development of novel compounds capable of killing resistant pests. Collaboration between the two groups beginning in the 1940s did not provide a solution to the resistance, but did lead to a strategic shift from pest control to pest management that continues to the present.","429":"J.B.S. Haldane's photographs reveal that this eminent geneticist was also a militant political agitator. Deeply engaged in left-wing British politics, Haldane eventually joined the Communist party, but found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his scientific beliefs with his Marxist commitments. During the controversy over Stalin's rejection of genetics in favour of Trofim Lysenko's agricultural reforms, Haldane's activities were critically interpreted from various different perspectives.","430":"","431":"The achievements of William Wales FRS - astronomer, classical scholar, demographer, editor, mathematician, meteorologist and humane teacher - have been overshadowed by the fame of Cook's extraordinary voyages, and overlooked as a significant influence on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's early development. The Royal Society sent Wales to Hudson Bay, Canada, and James Cook to Tahiti, both to observe the 1769 transit of Venus as part of an international project to calculate solar parallax, and hence the distance to the Sun. Wales later taught mathematics and navigation science at Christ's Hospital School to a precocious Coleridge, whose creative mind translated tales of polar adventures into memorable poetry.","432":null,"433":"Scientific racism was widely used as a justification to oppose race-mixing in the United States. Historians have justly criticized this abuse of science, but have overlooked some of the important ways in which science was used in the 1930s and 1940s to overturn scientific racism and opposition to race-mixing. Of particular importance was the cultural anthropology of Franz Boas and the evolutionary biology of Theodosius Dobzhansky, which supplied arguments against racism and fundamentally altered the scientific understanding of race.","434":null,"435":"Julia Pastrana toured Europe in the late 1850s advertising herself as the 'Bearded and hairy Lady' or 'Nonedescript'. She suffered from a rare inherited disorder, not understood until the late 20th century, which manifested itself in facial distortion and considerable facial hair in the male pattern. Doctors, as well as sensation seekers, were very keen to examine her. Her story is unusual, not least because she was mummified after death by her husband-manager and continued to tour as a mounted exhibit for a number of decades. Indirectly, she participated in the evolutionary debate in Britain. In 1857, when she arrived in Britain from America, she was popularly known as the baboon-woman. When Darwin's Origin of Species was published, and evolutionary controversy about ape-ancestry was hot in the air, she was more often likened to the gorilla or orang-utan - as a possible specimen of a missing link.","436":"Chang and Eng, the two young men who would eventually be known around the world as the 'original' Siamese twins, arrived in the West in 1829. They were brought to the West to be examined by medical men and to be exhibited to the general public. Throughout the 19th century in Britain and the US, 'monstrosities' such as Chang and Eng, as well as a host of other people with unusual anatomies, were considered both spectacles worthy of public display and edifying medical subjects with the potential to build on medical knowledge. The unique case of Chang and Eng illustrates that the boundary between what is of legitimate medical interest and what is considered merely spectacle is often blurred.","437":"Few people know the name of the Royal Society's first President, even though he features prominently in Thomas Sprat's famous allegorical frontispiece. In promotional images, his individual identity is irrelevant for proclaiming the Society's allegiance to Francis Bacon and commitment to experimental investigation. By contrast, William Brouncker's name does appear on Peter Lely's large portrait, which hung at the Royal Society. Brouncker was a gifted mathematician as well as a conscientious administrator, and Lely's portrait reproduces the diagram of one of his innovative algebraic proofs.","438":"","439":"In the 1820s, certain minute objects began to be used regularly as tests for microscopes. Scales of insects, animal hairs and tiny leaves served as convenient means to assess their optical performance. It was a peculiar conjunction of optics, astronomy and natural history that formed the intellectual background for the emergence of the tests; and their establishment was greatly facilitated by the culture of conversation and competition in which microscopical practice was embedded. The introduction of the tests soon gave rise to a peculiar and highly productive interaction: the application of test objects incited instrument makers to aspire after technical improvements. These pursuits led, in turn, to a differentiation and refinement of the tests themselves, which then again suggested specific kinds of improvements. Historians have paid only scant attention to these issues. But the early history of test objects deserves thorough investigation. In fact, it provides a key to the understanding of the intellectual and social contexts and the dynamics of microscopy in early 19th-century Britain.","440":"It has been suggested that successful art helps to solve our emotional problems. Can it therefore help with our current crisis in the relationship between biological science and society? Art and science are activities that have seemingly different cultures; scientists are seen as objective and rational, artists as subjective and intuitive. Each inhabit cultures that are seen to be mutually exclusive, but this has not always been the case. For example, during the Renaissance, people were schooled across both art and science and there was no clear dividing line. Where did the split occur, and is their interaction important in the 21st century?","441":"In Japan, it took over 30 years to register the contraceptive Pill, but it took only six months to approve Viagra. The Pill was developed in an academic institution and no large pharmaceutical manufacturer wished to market it. Viagra was developed inside a big company and actively promoted. In the USA, the Pill was almost removed from the market because of widely publicized reports of deaths, but mortalities associated with Viagra do not make the headlines. Viagra has been promoted by the famous, whilst those who use the Pill do not appear in advertisements. Even theologians have treated these two drugs according to different standards. It is suggested that this asymmetry is not accidental, but is an expression of a deep-seated dual standard that is ultimately driven by biosocial differences in male and female power, and reproductive agendas rooted in human evolution.","442":"In the 1920s, research on the endocrine glands--especially the sex glands--was widely expected to lead to revolutionary new ways of improving human life. The medical marketplace was crowded with glandular techniques to revitalize the aged. 'Monkey glands' apart, the Austrian physiologist Eugen Steinach's simple, vasectomy-like operation was perhaps the most popular of these. Steinach was one of the leading endocrine researchers of the early 20th century and the Steinach Operation was based on rigorous laboratory research. It was much more than a simple scientific error, and its history shows us how early endocrine research was shaped by broader social and cultural forces.","443":"Few historians of science would associate the Spanish Empire with scientific innovation. However, recent research is increasingly demonstrating the Crown's strong commitment to scientific research, particularly in the areas of botany, natural history and medicine. Although this commitment began in the 16th century, it reached full development in the 18th, when Enlightenment ideals led to growing interest in exploiting natural resources in the New World. Interest in new resources, which offered alternatives to silver and traditional cash crops, focused largely on medicinal herbs indigenous to the Americas. Herbs that provided 'miracle cures' for age-old diseases would bring both material and moral wealth to the Crown, and were thus pursued vigorously throughout Spanish America. The result was a search for an 'herbal' El Dorado, reminiscent of 16th-century expeditions in search of a mythical land of gold--only in this case, medicine, not metal, was the goal.","444":"The eruption of the volcano Krakatau in the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia) in 1883 had worldwide impact. This was perceived in the three quite different types of global propagation that occurred after the eruption: a rapid pressure wave, noticeable only to measuring instruments, followed a few hours later by the spread of the news of the event, succeeded by a slowly expanding optical phenomenon that lasted for a couple of years. Krakatau was the first natural catastrophe of global magnitude that was almost immediately recognized as such throughout the world, largely thanks to the recently installed worldwide telegraphic network.","445":"","446":"","447":"In the mid-1980s, when the first DNA profiling techniques were developed, the name DNA 'fingerprinting' was widely used. At the time, fingerprinting was a well-established forensic method, and it was rarely questioned in the courts. Fingerprint examiners were permitted to describe matching prints as evidence of individual identity, and they were not required to give probability estimates. Despite its nominal association with the older technique, DNA 'fingerprinting' went through a period of controversy, especially in the US courts. The association with fingerprinting was questioned, and experts were required to qualify their testimony with probability figures. Heated debate occurred in scientific publications and law courts about the statistical and population genetic assumptions that went into the probability calculations presented in court cases. However, by the late 1990s DNA profiling was so widely accepted that it became a basis for invidious comparison with all other forms of forensic evidence, including fingerprinting. In the past three years, the admissibility of fingerprint evidence has been challenged in several US federal and state courts. This article discusses the socio-legal and socio-technical issues that led to the inversion of credibility that characterized the intertwined history of the two techniques.","448":"The history of science tends to be recounted as a story of progress from early goals and discoveries to a unified outcome, in some sense implicit from the beginning, and often due to technological advances. The sequencing of the human genome is no exception. As a crucial part of the Human Genome Project, the history of genomic sequencing is typically presented as a direct result of the discoveries of the structure of DNA and its coding function, together with practical factors such as the development of techniques which made large-scale sequencing possible. However, the history of sequencing is inevitably a more complicated story, not only about molecular biology, but also about the evolving culture of scientific practice at the end of the 20th century.","449":"There are no established conventions for portraying scientific women. At the Royal Society, the first image of a female scientist was Henry Moore's drawing of Dorothy Hodgkin's hands, cruelly twisted by agonising arthritis. In her famous oil portrait, Maggi Hambling also focuses on Hodgkin's hands, thus symbolising the Nobel-prize winner's dedication to research and the importance of manual dexterity. Although Hambling's picture features a model of insulin, it is very different from photographs celebrating the discovery of DNA.","450":"This year, widespread attention has been bestowed upon the discovery of the Watson-Crick model of DNA. This extensive publicity contrasts with the sparse news coverage it received in 1953, when war-torn Britain was celebrating the coronation of Queen Elizabeth and the first ascent of Mount Everest. The remarkable growth of molecular biology since 1953 is the chief reason for the attention given to the Watson-Crick model today.","451":"Several replicas of Watson and Crick's demonstration model of DNA built at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge in 1953 exist, but where is the original? Once the object of intense discussion but soon superseded by more refined models built at King's College London, it slowly fell to pieces and was eventually disassembled. Twenty years after it was first constructed, some of its pieces resurfaced at Bristol. By that time, the value attached to the original incarnation of the double helix had changed substantially, and the Science Museum in London commissioned a replica of the model, with some of the original parts built into it. The model was hailed as 'the nearest there is to the original'. It has since served as prototype for further replicas. Meanwhile the spidery model of DNA has become the ultimate icon of 20th-century life sciences, and more pieces supposedly belonging to the original continue to appear at auction.","452":"Cyril Dean Darlington (1903-1981) has been forgotten by historians, but was in his day, the leading cytologist of the premolecular era. Of humble and inconspicuous beginnings, Darlington started his career as an unpaid volunteer worker under the aging William Bateson. Working in almost total isolation and with no scientific guidance, he boldly deduced the laws of chromosome behaviour, making cytology relevant once again both to genetics and to evolutionary theory. This process did not proceed smoothly, for both Darlington's method, and cross-disciplinary approach made the reception of his novel ideas difficult. This article examines Darlington's contribution to the premolecular understanding of Life, and the reasons why it was so difficult to accept.","453":"The legacy of Mendel's pioneering studies of hybridization in the pea continues to influence the way we understand modern genetics. But what sort of picture did Mendel himself have of his work and its ultimate uses, and how does that picture compare with the collection of ideas and methodologies that was put forward in his name and later became known as 'Mendelism'? With genetics standing at the center of our present biomedical and biotechnological research, an examination of the history of our concepts in the field can help us better understand what we should and should not expect from current genetic claims. For that enterprise there is no better starting place than Mendel himself.","454":null,"455":"The concept of heredity played a powerful role in structuring 19th-century debates over sickness, morality, class, race, education, social change and evolution. But there was very little agreement as to which qualities were heritable and how new hereditary variants were acquired. In consequence, notions of heredity existed in a wide variety of forms, expressing anything from extreme determinism and a belief in the incorrigibility of individuals, social and racial groups, to unleavened optimism, and a faith in ultimate human perfectibility. This article explores these rich hereditarian discourses to convey an impression of a century that was at least as preoccupied with the concept of biological inheritance as we are today.","456":"","457":"","458":"Although chemistry is by far the largest scientific discipline according to any quantitative measure, it had, until recently, been virtually ignored by professional philosophers of science. They left both a vacuum and a one-sided picture of science tailored to physics. Since the early 1990s, the situation has changed drastically, such that philosophy of chemistry is now one of the most flourishing fields in the philosophy of science, like the philosophy of biology that emerged in the 1970s. This article narrates the development and provides a survey of the main topics and trends.","459":"Recently, historians have focused on Warren S. McCulloch's role in the cybernetics movement during the 1940s and 1950s, and his contributions to the development of computer science and communication theory. What has received less attention is McCulloch's early work in neurophysiology, and its relationship to his philosophical quest for an 'experimental epistemology' - a physiological theory of knowledge. McCulloch's early laboratory work during the 1930s addressed the problem of cerebral localization: localizing aspects of behaviour in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Most of this research was done with the Dutch neurophysiologist J.G. Dusser de Barenne at Yale University. The connection between McCulloch's philosophical interests and his experimental work can be expressed as a search for a physiological a priori, an integrated mechanism of sensation.","460":"After Galileo had discovered the four moons of Jupiter in 1609 he became increasingly convinced that the Copernican, heliocentric system of the world was correct. However, this ran against the opinions of the Church and a large number of contemporary astronomers and natural philosophers. The ensuing development culminated in the condemnation of the Copernican system by the Church in 1616 and of Galileo himself, who had propagated the Copernican system in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), in 1633. Nevertheless, there was a constant debate about the right world system during the whole 17th century. Pictorial representation played an important role in it and the illustrations used as book frontispieces were a significant medium for the dispute.","461":"The voyages of scientific discovery conjure in our minds images of Sir Hans Sloane bioprospecting in Jamaica in 1687 or Joseph Banks voyaging aboard the Endeavour to Tahiti and New Zealand in 1768. But women also set foot on rickety and unsure ocean-going vessels in the 18th century in the service of science. The German-born Maria Sibylla Merian voyaged from Amsterdam to Surinam in South America in 1699 to search for exotic caterpillars. She sought one that would produce a thread to rival silk, a costly and much sought-after fabric in early-modern Europe. In the process, she produced one of the most celebrated 18th-century natural history books.","462":"In the first decades of the 20th century, soil bacteriologists promised to revolutionize farming practice, much in the same way that medical bacteriologists, in the previous century, had transformed pathology, public health and sanitary engineering. Following the isolation of the microorganisms responsible for nitrification and nitrogen fixation, American soil scientists anticipated the time when farmers could 'seed' their crops and lands with these beneficial bacteria. Soil bacteriologists, during the early 20th century, never fulfilled the promise of supplying a biological source of unending soil fertility. However, in their search for productive microbes, these same researchers directed attention to the underappreciated dimensions of bacterial metabolism and microbial ecology.","463":"How do scientists become famous? Carl Linnaeus was an expert at self-promotion who used portraits to gain patronage and consolidate his reputation. His sexualized classification system was hugely controversial, yet his successors celebrated him as a great hero of botany.","464":"","465":"English gardens powered by steam engines offer an intriguing view of how technological and scientific progress was naturalized in the landscape of 19th-century Prussia, and in Prussian culture, during the early years of industrial modernization. One such garden is Peacock Island, in the Havel River near Potsdam. A product of the reform era that preceded and followed the Napoleonic Wars, it expressed the goal of Friedrich Wilhelm III and his government to enter into the British system of factory production and world trade. Modern science, as represented especially by Alexander von Humboldt, played a prominent role.","466":"From 1954 to 1963, numerous scientists engaged in a public debate over the possible hazards from radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing. Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, a California Institute of Technology chemist, was one of the most prominent. His scientific papers relating to the fallout debate reveal many of the scientific, social and political issues involved in the controversy. Although the public controversy ended after the signing of the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, many of the scientific questions about the possible hazards of low-level radiation remain under debate within the scientific community. Moreover, the fallout debate was a prototype of current controversies over environmental and public-health hazards.","467":"Towards the end of the 1840s, Hermann von Helmholtz began to investigate experimentally the propagation of stimuli within nerves. Helmholtz's experiments on animals and human subjects opened a research field that in the following decades was intensively explored by neurophysiologists and experimental psychologists. Helmholtz's pioneering investigations justify the central place he occupies in accounts of the history of modern psychophysiology. Studying the concrete experimental settings and their local contexts shows how deeply the work of scholars such as Helmholtz is embedded in the history of culture and technology. In particular, the rapidly growing technologies of electromagnetism, which gave rise to telegraphy and electric clocks, facilitated the time measurements of 19th-century physiologists and psychologists.","468":"The identity of x-rays was initially mysterious, their connotations including morbidity and the otherworldly. Gradually they became routine, finding a place in the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiologists established a niche in hospitals, contributing to the industrialization of healthcare. Control of x-ray tube output was improved while an infrastructure enforcing radiation protection accompanied the continued growth of the field. X-ray diffraction proved a powerful tool with which to examine substances at the atomic scale. Since 1950, x-ray researchers have taken advantage of synchrotrons' copious production of continuous x-ray spectra, and the marriage of x-rays with electronics has led to a cornucopia of cheap and highly efficient analytical tools.","469":"During the 18th century, mineralogy constituted an integral part of natural history, sharing the concerns of botany and zoology over collection and classification. In Paris, many people owned private mineral collections, but these have been largely neglected by historians. Here, I examine the place of private collections in the history of mineralogy, arguing that they contributed socially, economically and intellectually to the field in a period before the dominance of the large national collection. I also show how the interests of private collectors diverged from those of the curators of public collections, particularly following the French Revolution.","470":"In the mid-1960s, a group of scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by Cyrus Levinthal, took hold of one of the early interactive graphics terminals and used it to visualize, study and model the structure of proteins and nucleic acids. From this encounter between cutting-edge computer technology and molecular biology emerged the crucial elements for the development of a research-technology field known today as interactive molecular graphics. The following account is not only about how computer graphics technology has literally changed the way scientists view the molecular realm, but also a look at how an epistemic and institutional space was created to integrate this technology into scientific research.","471":"","472":"","473":"This article illustrates the work of Jeremiah Joyce--a jobbing scientific textbook author working at the beginning of the 19th century. It shows how textbook authorship was a developing craft and how textbooks were partly formulated from the commercial speculations of educational publishers. The article seeks to promote the study of textbooks as a rich source for the history of science.","474":"This article examines the scientific content of the most famous comic journal of the Victorian period: Punch. Concentrating on the first three decades of the periodical (1841-1871), I show that Punch usually engaged with science that was highly topical, of consequence to the lives of its bourgeois readers, and suitable for comic interpretation. But Punch's satire of scientific topics was highly complex. It often contained allusions to non-scientific topics, and its engagement with science ranged from the utterly comic to the sharply critical. Punch prompted readers to think as well as laugh about science, and probably shaped their scientific education more than we think.","475":"Forging a scientific career in 19th-century Britain was difficult for most middle-class scientists. Despite his discovery of thallium in 1861 and later distinction as an experimental physicist that led him to the Presidency of the Royal Society (1913-1915), William Crookes (1832-1919) never obtained one of the limited number of academic or official positions. Scientific journalism and commercial activities were eventually to bring him financial security, but before that he was an opportunist willing to try his hand at anything that would win him national publicity. This is illustrated by his intervention in the great cattle plague epidemic that swept the UK between 1865 and 1866.","476":"","477":"","478":"The tensions between public and private science, so familiar to us today, were alive in the science of the industrial revolution. These tensions confronted the members of a society of chemists and natural philosophers, physicians, industrialists and instrument makers who met in London from 1780 to 1787. Their meetings, held in private rooms in coffee houses, provided an ideal forum for their blend of public and private science, reinforced by a vital international network of scientific intelligence. The records of those meetings tell us a good deal about communication among natural philosophers in the 1780s, and show that some, at least in Britain, were well-informed about the latest foreign developments.","479":"The image of Roger Bacon as a 'modern' experimental scientist was propagated as historical truth in 19th century scientific historiography. Twentieth century criticisms attacked this tradition, arguing that Bacon was primarily a medieval philosopher with 'medieval' scientific interests. However, recent scholarship has provided a more careful and critical account of Bacon's science, and identifies his greatest achievement in terms of his successful attempt to assimilate the worlds of Greek and Islamic optics. It can be justly claimed that Roger Bacon was the first Western thinker in the middle ages to have mastered most of the Greek sources and the central Islamic source in optics. He made this scientific domain understandable for a Western Latin-reading audience. Yet, Bacon himself acknowledged Adelard of Bath, whose translations and commentary of Euclid's Elements set the foundations for a science of optics, as the true pioneer.","480":"'The German physical chemist Fritz Haber was distinguished not only for his researches, but also for his services to industry and to his country. Haber and the research institutes he directed contributed to a wide range of advances in physical chemistry. His most outstanding scientific achievement was his synthesis of ammonia, which solved the urgent problem of meeting the world demand for nitrogen fertiliser'. So begins the entry to Haber in the 1972 Encyclopaedia Britannica. Haber was indeed a great and versatile scientist, but his was also a vigorous and complex personality that interacted in unexpected ways with the social and political circumstances of his time.","481":"","482":"In a concluding session, David Knight (University of Durham) took the title '\"One great slaughter-house the warring world\"--living in revolutionary times'. He pointed out that Darwinian thought had to contend with three revolutions. First, the political revolutions of 1776 and 1789, leading to the terror of the 1790s that washed over the English Midlands leaving Priesley's house burnt and Priestley himself exiled to America. Second, the scientific revolution, which valued exact knowledge and specialism rather than wide syntheses. Third, the Romantic revolution which emphasized the tragic rather than the cheerful optimism of Darwin's heroic couplets. For all these reasons Darwin's influence waned. However, Knight finished on an optimistic note that echoed King-Hele's opening address, saying that in our own times, as suspicion of experts grows, and some, at least, see science as a liberating force, Darwin's fame may recover. Negotiations are in process for the publication of the proceedings under the title 'The genius of Erasmus Darwin: proceedings of a bicentennial conference', and a website has been constructed that contains details of all speakers (http:\/\/www.bham.ac.uk\/erasmusdarwin\/).","483":"The mammalian hippocampus is certainly one of the best investigated brain regions. It fascinates neuroscientists particularly because of its important role in memory. The names for the various parts of the hippocampal formation were created in the course of the first thorough explorations of human brain anatomy. The present, internationally agreed terminology reflects an unfortunate muddle that has been going on for several hundred years. Not surprisingly, even today the origins of some of the names are not always given correctly. It is generally accepted that the Italian anatomist Arantius was the first to apply the term 'hippocampus' to part of that region in the human brain. To later authors, however, this name appeared more or less enigmatic and they proposed various other terms. Yet careful reading of the entire original text of Arantius leads to the conclusion that it was not the hippocampus in our modern terms but the dentate gyrus which he compared to a little sea horse or a silkworm.","484":"Establishing nature reserves is the foundation of regional conservation strategies. The science of nature reserve design is relatively new, having emerged alongside the interdisciplinary field of conservation biology over the past three or four decades. Its goal is to apply scientific ideas and methods to the selection and design of nature reserves and to related problems, such as deciding what kinds of buffer zones should surround reserves or how to establish corridors to link reserves and allow organisms to move from one area to another. As in other areas of conservation biology, designing nature reserves is a 'crisis' science, whose practitioners are driven by an acute sense of urgency over the need to stem the loss of species caused by human population growth.","485":"","486":"John Walsh's research on electric fish, carried out between 1772 and 1775, proved fundamental for demonstrating that electricity might be involved in animal physiology, and, moreover, in favouring a period of great progress in both the physiology and physics of electrical phenomena. However, Walsh is hardly known to modern neuroscientists and is largely neglected by science historians also. One of the reasons for this neglect is that he never published his 'crucial experiment', that is the production of a spark from a discharge of the electric eel.","487":"In 1603 Federico Cesi, along with four of his friends, founded the first Scientific Academy in Europe, the Accademia dei Lincei, which included Galileo Galillei as a member. Between 1611 and 1630 Cesi undertook an ambitious project to collect and record fossils from his lands around Acquasparta in Umbria. He had drawings and descriptions made of all the excavated fossils, fossil woods and their sites of origin. He died before his work could be published and it was left to his friend Francesco Stelluti to publish a monograph in which he claimed that evidence demonstrated that the fossil woods were formed from stone and were 'not once living'. The corpus of drawings, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor, has allowed the project to be reconstructed and fieldwork in Italy has shown that the complex nature of the fossil preservation could have easily confused the researchers and have led to misinterpretation of the fossils. This research by Cesi is the first to combine field and specimen data to interpret the origin of fossils and has been widely neglected by historians of Science.","488":"","489":"","490":"Six years after his return from the voyage of the Beagle, Darwin moved his family to the country, where he spent the rest of his life conducting experiments, writing, and raising a family. English Heritage recently purchased Down House and is restoring the house and grounds to look as they did during Darwin's life.","491":"","492":"Frequently, letters, words and sentences are used in undergraduate textbooks and the popular press as an analogy for the coding, transfer and corruption of information in DNA. We discuss here how the converse can be exploited, by using programs designed for biological analysis of sequence evolution to uncover the relationships between different manuscript versions of a text. We point out similarities between the evolution of DNA and the evolution of texts.","493":"The development of science education in England and Wales was slow in the 19th century. Here, I examine the causes of this slow development, and also the factors that affected the direction that science education took in elementary schools, secondary schools and universities.","494":"Since the dawn of history, human beings have witnessed the appearance of epidemic or epizootic diseases. The suddenness and the prevalence of these plagues were generally considered to be connected with occult influences of the stars or planets upon human affairs, climatic changes or religious reasons. Slowly, the principle of the origins of contagious diseases has become better understood and the role of transmissible influences such as parasites, bacteria and viruses has been accepted. A landmark was discovery of the germ theory, which included small parasites, bacteria and viruses. This theory was mainly based on the studies of Koch, Lister, Pasteur and many others.","495":null,"496":"Evolutionary theory aroused vigorous debate in the late-19th century, regarding both its scientific status and its sociocultural implications. Alfred Russel Wallace's lecture tour of North America, during 1886-1887, affords a striking insight into his particular interpretation of evolution and reveals the depth of his conviction that science was inseparable from ethical and political realities. Wallace's views on matters scientific and cultural were as controversial and significant in North America as they were in Great Britain and Europe.","497":"Over half a century ago, when I took Beginning Physics at university, I was bothered by the anomaly that normal air pressure (which is arbitrary anyhow) was taken to be 1.013250 bar instead of a sensible 1.000000 bar. My professor could not explain why, nor could any of the many other scientists whom I have asked since then. Now in retirement, I have made a laborious search in utterly uncharted territory and discovered the answer.","498":"Many historians have assumed that the advent of the chromosome theory of heredity and the theory of the gene settled the old debate over preformation versus epigenesis in favour of preformation. An analysis of the views of leading British cytologists between 1900 and 1920 indicates that the story is more complex. Cytologists could accept seemingly preformationist tenets about the hereditary factors and yet maintain an overall epigenetic view of organism development by assuming that genes interact dynamically with the cytoplasm and that the cell is influenced by its environment throughout growth and development.","499":"Two hundred and fifty years ago, the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) published his Philosophia botanica. This textbook in botanical science was widely read well into the 19th century. Today it is remembered mainly for two things: the introduction of binomial nomenclature and the formulation of a fixist and creationist species concept. While the former achievement is seen as a practical tool, still applicable for purposes of identification and information retrieval, the latter is usually deemed to have been one of the main obstacles to scientific progress in biology. That both achievements were not independent of each other, but interlocked theoretically and grounded in a specific scientific practice still thriving today--the collection of plant specimens in botanical gardens--is usually overlooked. The following article tries to uncover these connections and to demonstrate the significance that Linnaeus' achievements had for modern biology.","500":"C.P. Snow's articulation of a two-culture divide rested on a particular view of science that has been elaborated and superseded by interdisciplinary science studies. Thus, comparisons of the 'science wars' of recent years to the Snow-Leavis controversy fail to recognize basic structural differences between the two sets of debates. In this article, I present these differences and offer some views of what has changed in the intervening years.","501":"Darwin returned to Shrewsbury in mid-June 1831 and spent that summer learning geology. He made geological maps of Shropshire and visited Llanymynech and other localities. From 3-20th August he joined Sedgwick on his tour of North Wales; they geologised west of Shrewsbury before travelling through Llangollen, Ruthin, Conwy to Bangor finally reaching Anglesey. Darwin left Sedgwick at Menai and walked to Barmouth making a special visit of Cwm Idwal. He returned to Shrewsbury on 29th August to open the letter from Fitzroy inviting him to join the Beagle. During this summer Darwin gained skills in all aspects of geology, including chemical analysis, which were to prove vital in the development of his ideas on natural selection.","502":"Joseph Hooker became one of the most influential botanists of his day. He is best remembered as a friend of Charles Darwin and an early advocate of natural selection. However, after returning to Britain from his first major voyage, Hooker spent years struggling to find a paid position that would allow him to pursue his studies of plant classification and distribution. As he worked to establish himself, he also helped transform the status of botany as a discipline. In all his efforts, Hooker relied on a network of unpaid, colonial collectors, whose often-forgotten contributions to Victorian natural history are vital to the understanding of the professionalization of the sciences in the 19th century.","503":"Before computers were machines, they were people. They were men and women, young and old, well educated and common. They were the workers who convinced scientists that large-scale calculation had value. Long before Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the ENIAC at the Moore School of Electronics, Philadelphia, or Maurice Wilkes designed the EDSAC for Manchester University, human computers had created the discipline of computation. They developed numerical methodologies and proved them on practical problems. These human computers were not savants or calculating geniuses. Some knew little more than basic arithmetic. A few were near equals of the scientists they served and, in a different time or place, might have become practicing scientists had they not been barred from a scientific career by their class, education, gender or ethnicity.","504":"In 1833 Sir John Herschel sailed to the British Cape Colony in southern Africa. It was a private voyage, the purpose of which was to undertake an astronomical survey of the southern heavens. But his private voyage was interpreted by both the British Government and the British public as a voyage of Imperial scientific exploration. Despite Herschel's explicitly private scientific intentions, he nonetheless became popularly incorporated into the ranks of imperial scientific explorers.","505":"Gaining an insight into what it meant to be a mathematical practitioner in the 17th century is difficult. People who thought themselves mathematical included navigators, sundial makers and book-keepers. For some, the simple use of instruments was construed as mathematical; for others, this was merely a 'showing of tricks'. One profession reliant on mathematics was land surveying. An analysis of this profession throws up many interesting questions about what it meant to be mathematical in early modern England.","506":null,"507":"","508":"The relationship between theoretical and experimental approaches to the problem of pattern generation during embryonic development has often been uneasy. This stems at least in part from the different emphases that have typically been used in the two approaches. The spectacular success of modern genetic techniques in uncovering developmental mechanisms has led to a widespread belief that theory is no longer very relevant. However, recent examples of data-driven modelling point to new roles for theoretical approaches in exploring important issues such as the robustness and evolution of pattern-forming mechanisms.","509":"Humphry Davy (1778-1829) was one of the first professional scientists, earning his living and rising spectacularly from an impoverished upbringing in Cornwall to be President of the Royal Society and a baronet. He owed his rise to patronage as well as to his range of abilities: as a lecturer, as a chemical theorist and as a very early applied scientist. But his exalted position brought him little happiness, for he could not satisfy all the hopes put upon him as the successor to Sir Joseph Banks. Admired rather than loved, he became unpopular and was seen as haughty. In his last two years, spent wandering lonely and sickly in Italy and the Alps, he sought to make sense of his life, writing dialogues as his bequest to the new generation.","510":"Astronomical techniques, calendars and devices were developed independently in many places around the world. However, there was much cross-cultural exchange of technology over the centuries. The cultures of Egypt, Greece, India and China influenced each others' astronomy and each cannot be treated in isolation.","511":"The Renaissance saw the evolution of troop management, fortification and artillery into 'mathematical' sciences and those who practiced these tasks into 'mathematical practitioners'. These terms have been allowed to imply that these areas were deeply theoretical, whereas they varied from theoretical to simply numerical. Gunnery, in particular, tended towards the latter. Practitioners of the simpler mathematics, however, gained by being able to connect their action to the more impressive study of 'the mathematicks'. Future work must recognize more critically the distinction inherent in the term 'mathematical' when applied to the arts of the Renaissance.","512":"The seventeenth-century Swedish Royal warship Vasa was painted and decorated with almost 500 figure sculptures and many carved ornaments. It is probably the most extensive sculptural work in wood to have been preserved from this period in European history. The ship's decorations are of particular importance given the scarcity of knowledge of how sculptures in general, and large ships in particular, were painted in Northern Europe during this period. About 20 different pigments have been characterized and it has been possible to reconstruct the appearance of many of the sculptures and to extend this knowledge to the ship's original appearance.","513":"","514":"","515":"A 'late developer' argument, common to Psychology and Economic History, can be used to explain cultural innovation. It argues that the 19th century theory of natural selection arose in England and not Germany because of--and not in spite of--England's scientific backwardness. Measured in terms of institutions, communities, and ideas, the relative retardation of English science was precisely what enabled it to adopt German advances in novel ways.","516":"Observation, depiction and description are active forces in the doing of science. Advances in observation and analysis come with advances in techniques of description and communication. In this article, these questions are related to the work of Leonardo da Vinci, 16th-century naturalists and artists like Conrad Gessner and Teodoro Ghisi, and 17th-century micrographers like Robert Hooke.","517":"The modern discipline of biology was formed in the 20th century from roots deep in the natural-history tradition, which dates from Aristotle. Not surprisingly, therefore, ecology can also be traced to natural history, especially its 19th-century tradition emphasizing the adaptive nature of organisms to their environment. During the 20th century, ecology has developed and matured from pioneering work on successional stages to mathematically rich work on ecosystem energetics. By the end of the century, ecology has made a return to its natural-history heritage, emphasizing the importance of the integrity of ecosystems in considering human interactions with the environment.","518":"","519":"","520":"","521":"Over time, the oil palm has become the crop of central importance to both our daily lifestyle and to many of the great industries that man has developed. Remarkably, few recognize the oil palm and its fruit, and even fewer know its history. This article tells the story of the oil palm's rise to prominence from a wild plant of Equatorial Africa to becoming the most valuable plantation economy of the tropical world.","522":"The history of the steam engine is generally linked to that of the Industrial Revolution. This article seeks to uncouple this seemingly necessary link by examining other contexts in which the steam engine was introduced and developed.","523":"In tune with an Enlightenment sensibility that focused on the search for order and regularities, monsters were given a marginal position in eighteenth-century medical works. By contrast, they had an important place at the Royal Society during the second half of the century. This article first focuses on the general interest in monsters within the context of the natural historical agenda and corporate activity of the Society and then addresses the medical understanding of monsters by members of the Society. Finally, it discusses some of the moral and social implications of their medicalization in eighteenth century England.","524":"During World War I, chemical-warfare practices were introduced into economic entomology in Germany. Fritz Haber, 'the father of chemical warfare', realized that Germany could not win the war and thus looked for 'civilian' uses for his chemical arsenal. Before the war, there was a rhetoric of dangerous 'masses' of insects but the large-scale techniques needed to deal with them had not been developed. The gap between rhetoric and practices enabled entomology to integrate chemical weapons into its working methods. This article traces transformations in the ways of seeing insects and their control from the mid-nineteenth century to after World War I.","525":"Biochemistry began as an identifiable, separate discipline at the beginning of the twentieth century. This article traces its early development, focusing on three pioneers--Eduard Buchner, Arthur Croft Hill and Arthur Harden.","526":"In about 1400, northern European artists suddenly began to depict the natural and human world in a 'realistic' or 'naturalistic' manner. At about the same time, new ideas about how to describe nature realistically emerged among scholars investigating the natural world. Over the next two centuries, this new approach to nature (which eventually became known as 'science') and the belief that it could provide a realistic depiction of nature transformed human attitudes to nature and the material world. Artisans or craftspeople were central to this transformation and thus more important than is usually recognized in forming the new attitudes that characterized the Scientific Revolution.","527":"Elizabeth Hevelius (1647-1693) was the second wife of Johann Hevelius, the renowned astronomer of Danzig, and assisted with his observations from the first years of her marriage. Hevelius wrote of her in his books as an able collaborator and she is portrayed in one of them observing with him. She brought out his final, posthumous work. With Johann, she received many notable visitors (including Edmond Halley) and observed with some of them at Danzig. She is the first woman astronomer of whom we have any record.","528":"Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is sometimes mentioned by both medical and literary historians as the introducer to England of smallpox inoculation. Usually, the story is garbled by confusion with Edward Jenner's later invention, vaccination. Some historians have rejected her claim, arguing that the credit belongs to the medical establishment of the day. So just how much importance has this gifted amateur in the story of medical science?","529":"","530":"During the 18th century, the reinvention of French surgery as a 'monarchical profession', in the words of Toby Gelfand, enabled the creation of an elite surgical knowledge from which uninstructed participants could be excluded. A link can be made between the types of resources used by surgeons to present themselves as expert healers, and the epistemological strategies of the operation. The sickbed was the scene of a performance, in which every actor's movements were described and constrained; the end product of an extended process of social negotiation, surgical training, physical restraint and submission.","531":"All his life, Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694), the founder of modern microscopic anatomy, was unwillingly involved in difficult debates within a reactionary medical milieu that questioned the significance of modern science and its utility to medicine. Malpighi's responses to his detractors, included in posthumous works first published in 1697 by the Royal Society, offer an important insight into a critical phase of scientific progress in the 17th century and help to reveal the prevailing conception of science. In some ways, Malpighi's views predate important ideas in modern biology.","532":"Is evolution 'progressive'? Biologists have been deeply divided in their answers to this question for over a century and a half. Darwin addressed the question in On the Origin of Species, prominent evolutionists debated the issue again in the middle decades of this century, and the issue has attracted renewed attention recently. Remarkably, the seeds of a solution to the problem may lie in Darwin's earliest private reflections on simplicity, complexity and the evolution of life.","533":"Newton has become a legendary figure belonging to the distant past rather than a historical person who lived at a specific time. Historians and scientists have constantly reinterpreted many anecdotal tales describing Newton's achievements and behaviour, but the most famous concerns the falling apple in his country garden. Newton's apple conjures up multiple allegorical resonances, and examining its historical accuracy is less important than uncovering the mythical truths embedded within this symbol. Because interest groups fashion different collective versions of the past, analysing mythical tales can reveal fundamental yet conflicting attitudes towards science and its practices.","534":"How the term 'genetic test' is defined, matters for social policy. The past few years have witnessed many efforts to enact legal barriers specifically against genetic discrimination. To the extent that information derived from genetic tests receives special protection, both enthusiasts for genetic medicine and those who stress its perils have an incentive to adopt a broad interpretation of genetic testing. However, the consequences have not always been those anticipated.","535":"Best known as the first down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, John Wesley Powell built his extraordinary career as geographer, geologist, anthropologist, bureaucrat, and conservationist from his knowledge of the arid region of the American West. Yet as much as Powell's scientific work, and his prescriptions for land reform, were grounded in the western landscape, they were equally situated in the booming Gilded Age capital of Washington, DC, where a new community of government scientists was gelling as part of an increasingly centralized federal state.","536":"There is a long tradition within scientific communities that encourages governments, patrons and citizens to enlist scientific expertise in the service of the public good. However, since the 17th century, scientists who have engaged in public political controversy have often been judged harshly by scientific colleagues, as well as by political adversaries. Some prominent scientists were politically active in Germany, France and England during the 1920s and 1930s; controversial stands were taken by the British physicist P.M.S. Blackett and the American chemist Linus C. Pauling against their countries' nuclear weapons policy following the Second World War.","537":"","538":"Since the 16th century, art historians have debated the methods of medieval artists. A frequent topic of discussion and one that has been invoked at times to distinguish the medieval artist from his early modern successor is the extent to which medieval art is based on the observation of nature. In this vein, much recent commentary has focused on selected works whose descriptiveness challenges the schematism of most medieval imagery. As argued here, assessing these images and the visual evidence they present of the artist's working method requires a methodology that is sensitive to the syntax of visual communication.","539":"Last year, the UK Government agreed that a potentially dangerous legacy of radiation-contaminated land should be dealt with, after decades of ignorance and inaction on the part of the authorities. The cost of this could run to many hundreds of millions of pounds, assuming that the hundreds of sites potentially involved, which date from the birth of the nuclear industry, can actually be identified. This very practical problem cannot be tackled without an understanding of the lost history of the production and use of radium--a history that is now precisely a century in duration.","540":"Herbert Spencer's evolutionary ideas related not just to the biological world but to the universe and everything in it. Human societies were also viewed through his evolutionary lens so that Spencer's evolutionary and political ideas are inextricably entwined.

It also speculates on the rise and fall of Spencer's reputation.","541":"Recent historical work has shown that while certain kinds of science were destroyed under the Nazi regime, other kinds flourished. Sciences of an applied nature were especially encouraged, as were sciences that fit within the larger program of Nazi segregation and extermination. Little attention, though, has been given to Nazi cancer theory and policy. That is curious, given that the Nazi regime launched one of the most comprehensive and successful cancer prevention programs of the century, involving bans on smoking, restrictions on carcinogenic food dyes, new steps to limit exposure to asbestos and radiation, and much else as well.","542":"During the course of his life, Worm made an epistemological shift from the sometimes secretive world of the late Renaissance Neoplatonist and Paracelsian philosopher, from the chemical laborant protecting proprietary processes, to the more open collection of natural and artificial particulars, objects that were stabile, public authorities, regardless of the theories that human minds might spin.","543":"Mid-19th-century mental scientists were intrigued by the phenomenon of memory, and self-reflexively applied associationist ideas to emerging concepts of unconscious mental reflex to explore it. They emphasized that the 'consciousness of agreement' between present and past states of consciousness was the basis of a coherent, well-managed identity. But they were also fascinated by forms of latent or unconscious memory, and they recognised that the analysis of memory lay at the heart of the study of consciousness itself, and the interconnections between the brain as a set of physiological processes and the mind responding to them. Here I contrast how two key figures in the emerging field of mental science --Henry Holland and William Carpenter--explore the interconnections between the act of recollection and the working of memory, and how their analysis of the limits of memory is taken up by Frances Power Cobbe.","544":"That models in science are of a variety of kinds and fulfil a variety of purposes has been particularly evident over the past 30 years in the field of developmental biology. At the beginning of this period, molecular and cellular mechanisms for developmental events were largely lacking, and theoretical models were developed faute de mieux. This gave way to a time in which a number of competing paradigms were present. Now, there is an increasingly detailed knowledge of underlying mechanisms, at a range of levels from genes through cells to organs and organisms. This is therefore a good time to review the usefulness of model making in general, with reference to this discipline. It is suggested that models are of two main kinds: models of structure and models of function. They fulfil three main roles, each of which operates at different stages of maturity of the field of interest. When the causes of some phenomenon are entirely mysterious, then a model may help generate hypotheses for subsequent testing. Second, when competing biological explanations are available, a model may help discriminate between hypotheses. Third, when a well-established hypothesis is available, models may facilitate use of the hypothesis. However, unlike physics, biology is stochastic and contingent, and cannot be entirely deduced from first principles. Mathematical modellers and biologists must remain in constant communication.","545":"","546":null,"547":"The botanist and explorer, Ferdinand von Mueller, was the most distinguished of the many German scientists who made important contributions to Australian science during the nineteenth century. This article explores the background to his going to Australia and the way in which he established a scientific career there, and outlines his principal contributions as Victoria's Government Botanist for over 40 years, from 1853 to 1896.","548":"Psychedelic drugs are making a comeback. Proponents of psychedelics point to the widespread medical experimentation with mescaline and lysergic acid diethylamide-125 (LSD) in the 1950s as proof of their safety and efficacy. However, a review of the private and published writings of Sidney Cohen, MD, who conducted the first study of the safety of psychedelics, reveals that serious medical concerns about psychedelics arose before the public backlash against the drugs in the 1960s. The story of psychedelic research is a reminder of the inevitable complications involved in testing drugs on human subjects.","549":"In the twentieth century studies of inheritance have been driven by both practical and theoretical concerns. The metaphor of a ladder helps to illustrate how applied and pure interests have worked together in scientific development. This 'ladder' has significant 'twists' in it due to the unique nature of genetics, entwining the science of heredity with powerful and possibly compromising personal, social and commercial agendas. These implications are manifest in the history of agricultural research, eugenics, and the business of science. Today, as in the past, genetics is a prestigious science that requires cautious movement forward as human beings face its tremendous challenges and potential dangers.","550":"Electricity has long proved to be a powerful tool for investigating the properties of life. Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century new discoveries and inventions in electricity stimulated a new popular fascination with such questions. Electricity seemed a good way of understanding the machinery of life. It was the key to unlocking the secrets of vitality. Looking at these early nineteenth-century debates and discussions provides a good way of focusing on the cultural connections and ramifications of science. As electricity provided tools for understanding life, it provided tools for understanding culture also.","551":"Keith R. Porter died on 2 May 1997. Although he was especially renowned for the work on cell structure recounted here, his impact on cell biology was not confined to the early electron-microscopic studies of ultrastructure. To many, he was the father of cell biology, who helped establish many of the enduring institutions and ideas in the field. He had great biological intuition and feeling for a wide range of organisms and was greatly concerned with problems of cell shape and movement. He used ultrastructure and simple physiological or biochemical experiments to inter functional activities for cell organelles, including not only the endoplasmic reticulum, which he named, but the sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-tubules of muscle cells, microtubules, cilia, coated vesicles and more. He also pioneered cell studies with the high-voltage electron microscope, which led him to the idea of structural integration in the cell cytoplasm, an idea that is only now being pursued with success.","552":"Fungal cells need to recognize that they are genetically different in order to mate. Cells signal to each other by secreting small peptide pheromones which are detected by cell surface receptors. New transcriptional regulators are formed that alter the pattern of gene transcription. Basidiomycete fungi are unusual in having several thousands of different mating types. In these fungi, mating partner recognition demands a remarkable degree of specificity on the part of the proteins and peptides involved.","553":"The organization and evolution of insect societies has amazed natural historians since Aristotle. Charles Darwin considered social insects to be a major difficulty for his theory of evolution by natural selection because they demonstrate a rich diversity of adaptation among sterile workers leading to a complex division of labour, something that should not occur if variation in individual reproductive success is the grist for the mill of natural selection. This article shows how division of labour can self-organize from groups of cohabiting individuals without the necessity of a past history of natural selection for co-operative behaviour. It then explores how more complex social systems may evolve.","554":"Headache is one of the most common types of pain, but its causes remain poorly understood. The long-standing idea that some headaches, particularly migraine, might be caused by cerebral or cranial vasodilation has failed to find support in recent studies. Alternative hypotheses have focused on other processes that might be capable of activating or sensitizing sensory nerve fibres that innervate the blood vessels of the intracranial meninges.","555":"Animals engage in a startlingly diverse array of behaviours that depend critically on the time of day or the ability to time short intervals. Timing intervals on the scale of many hours to around a day is mediated by the circadian timing system, while in the range of seconds to hours a different system, known as interval timing, is used. Recent research has illuminated some of the neural mechanisms underlying the 'internal clocks' of these two different timing systems in both animals and humans. Therapeutic applications for humans with impairments in either timing system may ultimately result from these endeavours.","556":"Understanding the causes of cancer remains a major area of uncertainty, and many serious proposals have been made from a variety of standpoints over the years. This article discusses the first genetic hypothesis from the turn of the century and two other totally different early approaches to the problem.","557":"Did the Neanderthals evolve into anatomically modern humans, or were they replaced by incoming populations of Homo sapiens sapiens? This is perhaps the most well-known question debated by palaeoanthropologists and archaeologists interested in the period from roughly 250,000 to 30,000 years ago in Eurasia. But while this debate may have attracted most of the media attention, there are other research questions that are at least as worthy of public interest as biological origins.","558":"","559":"Stable isotopes are safe, versatile, scientifically rigorous tools for studying nutrient metabolism in humans. They can be used to follow the metabolism of nutrient minerals from specific foods or diets, including the determination of efficiency of absorption and the effects of dietary constituents on absorption, and to investigate fundamental aspects of nutritional biochemistry. In this article we describe stable isotope methods and the results of some recent nutrient mineral metabolism studies in humans.","560":"Animals engage in a startlingly diverse array of behaviours that depend critically on the time of day or the ability to time short intervals.

Therapeutic applications for humans with impairments in either timing system may ultimately result from these endeavours.","561":"The Martian surface shows abundant evidence of water erosion. Liquid water is unstable under present climatic conditions but conditions may have been different in the past. The planet has been volcanically active throughout its history. The combination of water and volcanism must have commonly resulted in hydrothermal environments similar to those in which grow the most primitive terrestrial life-forms.","562":"Much of what we know about extinct organisms comes from traits that are not preserved in the fossil record. Until recently, morphological analysis was the only tool available for scientists to determine relationships for extinct fossil organisms. We now know that \"ancient' DNA can be preserved in the remains of extinct organisms. By targeting specific gene sequences, it may be possible to deduce biochemical characteristics and through sequence comparisons, to estimate the extent of evolutionary divergence. By comparing the amount and type of these changes, one could estimate how quickly some DNA 'evolves' relative to other segments, or which genes have the most flexibility or are more conserved over time. The compilation of these data would yield greater understanding of the physiology of extinct organisms and provide a much clearer picture of genetic change over time, and the mechanics behind 'evolution'.","563":"Microorganisms have a significant influence on the environmental fate of radionuclides in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with a multiplicity of physico-chemical and biological mechanisms effecting changes in mobility and speciation. Physico-chemical mechanisms of removal include association with extracellular materials, metabolites and cell walls which are features of living and dead organisms. In living cells, some physico-chemical processes are reversible, influenced by metabolism and changing environmental conditions. Metabolism-dependent mechanisms of radionuclide immobilization include sulphide precipitation, transport and intracellular compartmentation and\/or sequestration by proteins and peptides. In addition, chemical reduction to less soluble forms can result in immobilization. Microbial processes involved in radionuclide solubilization include autotrophic and heterotrophic leaching, and complexation by siderophores and other metabolites. Such mechanisms are important components of biogeochemical cycles for radionuclides and should be considered in any analyses of environmental radionuclide contamination. In addition, several microorganism-based biotechnologies are receiving interest as potential treatment methods.","564":"Human proteins, including enzymes, manufactured with recombinant-DNA yeasts can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions; some redesign of molecular structure (and production techniques) should increase their specificity, efficacy and immunotolerance. Prevention and treatment of diseases due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may become possible. Therapeutic vaccines for some diseases may be produced by design-specification for particular desirable protein features, on an individual patient basis.","565":"Dreaming is characterized by formal visual imagery (akin to hallucination), by inconstancy of time, place and person (akin to disorientation), by a scenario-like knitting together of disparate elements (akin to confabulation) and by an inability to recall (akin to amnesia). Taken together, these four dream features are similar to the delirium of organic brain disease. By studying the brain during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep--the phase of sleep in which most dreaming occurs--we can begin to understand its basis in the altered neurophysiology of REM.","566":"Isoprene is emitted from both plants and animals at significant rates. There is evidence for a specific enzyme, isoprene synthase, that produces isoprene from dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate, one of the intermediates involved in the synthesis of higher-order isoprenoids such as cholesterol, carotenoids and monoterpenes (for example, pine scent). The role of isoprene in animals is unknown, but there is recent evidence that isoprene helps protect plant membranes involved in photosynthesis from thermal damage. Isoprene emission from plants is a natural process that contributes more hydrocarbon to the atmosphere than all of the anthropogenic hydrocarbons.","567":"Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles that are present in all eukaryotic organisms. These organelles are the focus of much contemporary interest among cellular and medical biologists--an interest which coincides with the realization of their vital role in higher organisms, their unique metabolic and biogenetic characteristics, and their widespread involvement in genetic and degenerative disease. This article reviews some of the major recent developments in peroxisome biology.","568":"The DNA molecule is a familiar object. It is often depicted in magazines and advertisements as a double helix, with the letters of the genetic code strung along the two spiral backbones and joined together in pairs. In such pictures the molecule is usually shown as straight; yet in the chromosomes of living organisms, DNA is curved and wound up into condensed packages. This article explains what is involved in such bending of DNA in the cell. It uses the ideas of structural mechanics--a tool of engineers--to show how the various components fit together when the molecule is bent.","569":"The long story of the once very widespread clay pipe has a minor but significant odontological aspect: some clay-pipe smokers may be characterized by a distinctive abrasion pattern of the teeth. The marks in question are of special interest to the archaeologist; attention is here directed particularly to the Scandinavian experience.","570":"Since the first conviction using fingerprints as evidence in 1902, the detection of fingerprints at crime scenes has become a key weapon in the identification and apprehension of criminals. Almost a century after Edward Henry published The Classification and Use of Fingerprints in 1898, a new magnetic flake technology has been purpose-designed for scene-of-crime investigations.","571":"Coloured hearing synaesthesia (from the Greek syn (union) and aisthesis (sensation)), has been known to the scientific community for over 300 years and yet has gone relatively uninvestigated. This review charts recent progress in the investigation of synaesthesia and discusses the consequences of this research for our understanding of the condition.","572":"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is the measurement of the weak magnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in the human brain. By measuring the magnetic field evoked when specific sensory stimuli are presented to a subject, a map of the functional organization of the brain can be deduced with a subcentimetre spatial resolution and a millisecond temporal resolution. As well as a tool for fundamental study of the brain, MEG can also be used in clinical studies and assessment of patients with specific neurological disorders.","573":"A large proportion of the population either snores or suffers the snoring of others. Recent advances with the use of fibre-optic endoscopes have enabled surgeons to observe the inside of the pharynx while a patient is asleep and snoring. In this article we look at the underlying structure of the upper airway and explain, with the use of simple mechanical models, the aerodynamic events occurring inside the upper airway during snoring.","574":"Bacteria (prokaryotes) were the sole form of life on earth for some two billion years--roughly half its history. During this time they evolved into a giant, global superorganism and developed a remarkable mechanism for the creation and exchange of genetic material. Apart from its intrinsic interest, this has practical significance, for example in the development of multiple resistance to antibiotics of pathogenic bacteria such as those of tuberculosis. Eukaryotes, with nucleated cells, may have developed from a permanent symbiosis of three or more prokaryotes.","575":"The self-organization whereby developing organisms generate the patterns and spatial relationships of their parts has not been explained on any generally accepted theoretical basis. There is a wide gulf between physical scientists and experimental biologists in their expectations of the kind of theory that is best to pursue. Physical scientists incline towards the power of nonlinear dynamics to generate pattern and are trying evangelistically to interest biologists in this approach.","576":"Large amounts of food, perhaps as much as one quarter of the world's agricultural production, is lost due to spoilage or contamination by harmful bacteria and other parasitic life forms. Food irradiation is an energy-efficient, non-chemical method of food processing that can help reduce these huge losses. Properly treated, irradiated foods retain their fresh appearance, flavour, and nutritional value, while most foods can be pre-packaged before irradiation, reducing the risk of recontamination. The technology for food irradiation is now well developed and irradiated foods are gaining public acceptance as they become more widely available.","577":"Although identified less than 20 years ago, Lyme disease has proved to be the most common tick-borne disease in the United States: some 10,000 cases were reported in 1992. In some cases the disease may be transitory and of little consequence but in others it may become chronic and severely disabling. Accurate diagnosis is, therefore, of great importance but, as this article shows, laboratory testing techniques still need improvement.","578":"A century ago, in his private laboratory in Berlin, Paul Ehrlich conceived and developed the idea of using antibodies to target toxic molecules. Recent advances in genetic engineering have enormously extended the potential of this concept for the treatment of malignant diseases, by making it possible to isolate genes encoded for the antibody variable regions and to manipulate them to create new molecules.","579":"Smell is one of the most important senses driving basic patterns of behaviour in most of the earth's animal species. It plays a role in food-finding, kin recognition, reproductive behaviour, the predator-prey relationship, mother-infant recognition, homing behaviour, nest-finding, and other behaviours. Students of animal behaviour have studied the role of olfaction extensively, but until recently little detail was known about the biology of the cells that respond to odours. This article describes some recent advances in our understanding of these cells.","580":"The problem of distinguishing particular sounds, such as conversation, against a background of irrelevant noise is a matter of common experience. Psychologists have studied it for some 40 years, but it is only comparatively recently that computer modelling of the phenomenon has been attempted. This article reviews progress made, possible practical applications, and prospects for the future.","581":"Venomous creatures have always had a peculiar fascination in both real-life and fiction and the nature of their venoms, how they act, and how they can be neutralized are intrinsically important fields of research. In recent years, however, interest has extended beyond this into the development of new protein and peptide substances of therapeutic importance.","582":"In the lecture following the award of his Nobel Prize for Peace in 1970 the eminent agronomist Norman Borlaug remarked: 'If you desire peace, cultivate justice but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread'. This is as true now as it was then. This article analyses trends in the relationship between cereal production and nitrogen fertilizer consumption up to the year 2030. It concludes that a doubling of chemical nitrogen consumption over this period is necessary to maintain world cereal production per capita at its present level.","583":"It has long been known that while damaged nerves of the peripheral nervous system in mammals are able to regenerate, this does not occur in the central nervous system. Recent studies have shown that a chemical factor present in regenerating fish optic nerves facilitates regeneration of nerve axons in rodents. Further research encourages the hope that this may ultimately lead to the successful treatment of nerve damage in humans.","584":"Until the discovery of insulin by Banting and Best in 1922, diabetes had a high mortality rate. Since then regular administration of the drug has brought it under control. Nevertheless it is not an ideal drug, in that it has to be injected and because of the incidence of insulin resistance. There is, therefore, a need for alternative forms of treatment and in recent years interest has centred on the possibilities of vanadium salts.","585":"The mechanisms of nonconjugative plasmid replication (in the single cell) and maintenance (at the population level) are of concern to the microbiologist and to the genetic engineer who wishes to exploit their ability to express cloned genes. This article concentrates mainly on Escherichia coli as the host organism and examines the mechanisms by which both naturally occurring and genetically engineered plasmids persist in populations during periods of growth. Additional strategies to ensure high yields of recombinant product are briefly considered.","586":"Bacteria, very early in their history, developed protective 'shock responses', triggered when the organism was exposed to some acute environmental stress. At the heart of each response was the accelerated synthesis of both general and stimulus-specified intracellular proteins. So successful was this strategy that its basic mechanism and several of its components were highly conserved throughout the course of evolution. This was particularly true of heat shock proteins whose universal distribution has both good and bad consequences for man.","587":"The use of a variety of genetic-engineering techniques to introduce foreign DNA into living yeast cells has resulted in the production in these cells of the corresponding proteins. These include enzymes, antibodies, vaccines, anti-viral agents, and hormones. This article discusses the techniques of genetic engineering in yeast and suggests the lines of future progress in the economic production of novel proteins for use in therapy.","588":"The existence of the thymus was recognised by ancient scientists and doctors, although its vital role in the development and maintenance of the competent T cell repertoire has been fully appreciated only comparatively recently. Current research is now moving on to explore the role of the thymus in interactions between the brain, the nervous system and the immune response. This is an exciting new field which should lead to advances in the management, treatment and prognosis of disease in man and animals.","589":"It has long been recognized that human moods are affected by seasonal changes: Hippocrates observed that 'of constitutions some are well or ill adapted to summer, others are well or ill adapted to winter'. It is only comparatively recently, however, that seasonal affective disorders (SAD) have been the subject of serious research. This indicates that mental depression--severe in a small minority of cases--may be related to low exposure to light in the winter months. In many cases phototherapy--which may influence melatonin production--brings relief.","590":"The latest edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1989) defines archaeology as '... the scientific study of the remains and monuments of the prehistoric period'. It is not surprising, therefore, that modern archaeology draws as much as possible on scientific methods of investigation developed in other fields. In the last ten years the powerful method of quantitative isotope analysis has brought a new dimension to the examination of archaeological finds.","591":"As sensory perception is the channel by which we learn about the nature of the world around us it has been the subject of philosophical inquiry since classical antiquity. With the emergence of science in its modern sense in the 17th century, experimental investigation began to be possible but it was only with the relatively recent advent of molecular biology that sensory perception can be studied at its basic level.","592":"Demonstration of the unique therapeutic properties of penicillin initiated an extensive investigation of other mould metabolites in the hope of finding other useful chemotherapeutic agents. While many hundreds of active substances were studied very few indeed satisfied the criteria necessary for clinical use. Among those whose toxicity ruled them out was gliotoxin. Recently, however a chance observation, in quite a different context, suggests that gliotoxin may prove valuable in human tissue transplantation.","593":"America's long-term commitment to a new Space Exploration Initiative has focused attention on the basic requirements for establishing a permanently manned lunar outpost and, ultimately, a martian one.  High among these is the development of Regenerative Life Support Systems--with lunar agriculture an essential component--to provide a high level of self-sufficiency.","594":"Carbohydrates are man's largest organic source of renewal energy both on land and in the sea. Whether consumed by man or animal, evolution has ensured that the enzymes in living cells use carbohydrates with conservation of that energy. Industries that make monomer carbohydrates dissipate the energy stored in its polymers. Prospects for future chemical and biochemical utilisation depend on remedying this tragedy and learning the lesson taught by nature.","595":"","596":"Archaeological excavations in Europe provide no evidence for the first modern humans pre-dating Neanderthal man. In the Near East, however, a quite different sequence seems to have pertained. Thermoluminescence dating indicates that at some sites the modern humans were settled some 30,000 years before the Neanderthals. This raises the possibility of two lines of descent from a common ancestor.","597":"The ability to communicate by speech was a crucial step in human evolution and there has been much controversy concerning the point at which it occurred. The recent discovery at Kebara of a well-preserved hyoid bone some 60,000 years old suggests that Neanderthal man had developed the anatomical structures necessary to articulate words. This in itself does not prove that such articulation occurred. But contributory evidence, such as endocranial casts indicates that the necessary brain differentiation had also developed. Further, what we know of the social organisation of Neanderthals suggests that some form of communication by speech was necessary.","598":"Of all the senses, that of taste is perhaps the hardest to define and quantify and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms is unrespondingly difficult. This article describes a conceptual model--at the molecular level--for the four basic taste modalities, using apparent specific volume as a fundamental parameter. It also considers possible practical applications.","599":"Advances made in our knowledge of the structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus have enabled us to identify a fragment, consisting of 20 amino acids, of one of the four proteins of the particle, which elicits neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals and in cattle and pigs. The fragment has been synthesised chemically by Merrifield's solid phase method and biochemically as part of different fusion proteins. The level of the immune response to the peptide, which depends critically on the way it is presented, affords protection against experimental challenge and holds out promise for its future as a vaccine.","600":"The importance of treating public water supplies to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms has long been recognized. In the past, emphasis has been laid on bacteria, but the hazard posed by certain protozoan parasites is being increasingly recognized. Some of these present a particularly serious problem in that they can survive chlorination and most purification treatments regarded by international standards, as giving adequate protection to the consumer.","601":"It is well established that in certain areas abnormally high concentrations of radon can find its way into buildings and that its radioactive decay products are potentially carcinogenic when inhaled. This article reviews the studies that have been made in attempts to ascertain how far this represents a real public health hazard.","602":null,"603":"Neurotoxins isolated from snake venom exhibit very specific actions on nervous structures. Their use in neurobiological research contributed to a better understanding of neuromuscular transmission and led to the isolation of a receptor, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.","604":"Biological monitoring is a means of assessing water quality, or the toxicity of chemicals, employing living organisms as the sensors. Relatively recent environmental regulations have led to the application of biomonitoring techniques by wastewater discharges and chemical manufacturers. Classical approaches to biomonitoring have included the acute bioassay which takes death as the end-point of the test. Recent developments include automated and real time biomonitors which utilize computer technologies for assessing changes in physiological or behavioural parameters to indicate the presence of toxics.","605":"Since the term allergy was introduced in the early years of this century a very diverse range of agents eliciting an allergic response has been identified. Among them, nickel was identified in 1925 and since then other metals, notably cobalt and chromium, have been shown to be implicated. Metal contact dermatitis can be initiated by a wide range of everyday articles-such as watches, earrings, and buttons--and is more prevalent than is generally supposed.","606":"Although the origin and evolution of vertebrate blood cells is conjectural and controversial, it is, nevertheless, of great interest, particularly to comparative immunologists seeking an underlying trend in the phylogenetic development of immunity. This review examines possible relationships between invertebrate and vertebrate blood cells and describes some of the original concepts put forward to account for blood cell evolution.","607":"Memory, and its failings, are surely the most important factors in determining human behaviour. In humans and the higher animals the memory process is manifestly so complex as to defy direct experimental investigation.
