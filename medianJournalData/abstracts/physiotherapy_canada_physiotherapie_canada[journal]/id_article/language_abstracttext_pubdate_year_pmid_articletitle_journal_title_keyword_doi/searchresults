The second purpose is to determine the standard error of measurements of the French-Canadian version of RAPT. Method: The transcultural translation and adaptation process of RAPT follows four steps: (1) initial translation, (2) retro-translation, (3) assessment of the questionnaire's clarity by patients, 4) assessment of the translation's transcultural validity. Furthermore, the RAPT standard error of measurements was calculated. Results: Participants were recruited at the Hull and Montfort hospitals. Twenty participants were recruited for step 3 and 83 participants for step 4. Results suggest that the RAPT and the French-Canadian translation (RAPT-FC) are comparable, with intraclass, intralanguage, interlanguage and temportal interlanguage correlation coefficents that varied from 0.858 to 0.988. The standard error of measurements is 0.8. Conclusions: The RAPT-FC tool is comparable to the original English version of the RAPT.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a one-day training session, including short lectures and workshops on developmental coordination disorder (DCD), on the perceptions that physical education teachers (PET) have of the knowledge, skills, and pedagogical practices. Methods: cohort study with a mixed pre-post-follow-up design that included a questionnaire before, immediately after, and three months after the training. Descriptive analyses, Wilcoxon tests, and a thematic analysis were performed. Results: 38, 35, and 22 PET respectively filled out the questionnaires at the three time-point. The perceptions of the knowledge, skills, and pedagogical practices of the PET were higher after the training compared to the initial perceptions (p &lt; 0.006). At first, the PETs reported using certain general pedagogical strategies (e.g., modifying the task). After the training, the PETs gave more concrete examples and reported using new strategies (e.g., offering feedback after the task), which seems to have decreased behavioural problems.

Of 98 women who participated in this randomized controlled study, 84 (39 trainees and 45 controls) completed the 18-month intervention. At both 18 months and 3.5 years, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data on 22 trainees and 22 control participants (ages 35-45 y) were available for hip structural analysis. The section modulus (Z), cross-sectional area (CSA), and subperiosteal width at the femoral neck were analyzed. Lower-leg explosive power and estimated maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2)max) were assessed by vertical countermovement jump and standardized 2 km walking test, respectively. Progressive supervised high-impact exercises were done three times per week for 18 months. Significant between-group differences in favour of trainees were observed after the 18-month intervention in Z (3.2%, p=0.047) and CSA (2.8%, p=0.043). At the 3.5-year follow-up point, the exercise-induced benefits in Z and CSA had diminished and were statistically insignificant. A between-group difference in favour of trainees was observed in lower-limb power after intervention (4.2%, p=0.002) and at 3.5-year follow-up (5.1%, p=0.003). A similar difference was seen in estimated Vo(2)max (5.6% after intervention, p=0.002, and 4.6% at 3.5-y follow-up, p=0.005). The 18-month high-impact exercise intervention strengthened the femoral neck in premenopausal women by enhancing its structural properties; however, this benefit was not maintained at 3.5-year follow-up. In contrast, the exercise benefits on physical performance continued to be maintained 3.5 years after intervention. ","631":"The purpose of this study was to examine changes in bone density and geometry of the forearm region and motor function of the paretic upper extremity in a person with subacute stroke. Client Description: The participant was a 48-year-old man with right hemiparesis. Not applicable. Measures and Outcomes: The assessment of upper-extremity (UE) function and bone imaging took place at 3 months and 12 months after stroke. The participant had moderate motor impairment and severe disuse of the paretic UE 3 months after stroke. During the follow-up period, no substantial change in paretic UE function was observed. At the 12 month follow-up, the areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the ultradistal and mid-regions of the paretic forearm, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, sustained a significant reduction of 7.9% and 5.9%, respectively. The non-paretic side, in contrast, had a significant 4.0% increase in aBMD of the mid-forearm and a 2.8% increase in aBMD of the total forearm. Significant findings from peripheral quantitative computed tomography were a reduction in total volumetric bone mineral density (-12.1%) and bone strength index (-20.6%) in the radius distal epiphysis on the paretic side and an increase in cortical bone mineral content (2.0%) and bone strength index (7.6%) in the radius diaphysis on the non-paretic side. After a stroke that resulted in moderate to severe UE impairment, a significant decline in bone mineral density was identified in various skeletal sites in the forearm region as the participant entered the subacute and chronic stages of recovery. The results point to the potential importance of early rehabilitative intervention in preventing unfavourable bone changes in the paretic upper limb among individuals with stroke. ","632":"","633":"To describe the meaning of mentorship among Canadian orthopaedic physiotherapists. As part of a phenomenological qualitative study, 14 registered physiotherapists (13 women, 1 man) each participated in a single 60-minute, semi-structured face-to-face interview. Participants reflected on their experiences in receiving and providing mentorship and described the impact of mentorship on their careers. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a phenomenological approach. Participants described mentorship as any nurturing process in which they used their skills and experience to guide, teach, and encourage a less skilled or less experienced colleague for the purpose of promoting professional and personal development. Participants experienced mentorship as a positive, reflective phenomenon. According to participants, the true essence of mentorship in physiotherapy consists of building passion, keeping fresh, making us stronger, and promoting deeper learning. Building a shared passion for learning, as well as a mentor's commitment to the mentee's success, forms the foundation of meaningful mentorship in physiotherapy. These mentoring relationships enable physiotherapists to adapt to the changing health care system, advance patient care, and develop the profession. ","634":"To describe Canadian Master of Physical Therapy (MPT) students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding peer mentorship. A quantitative cross-sectional survey study was conducted. An online questionnaire was sent to 945 MPT students via e-mail, using a modified Dillman approach. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Canadian MPT students. A total of 260 MPT students (27.5%) responded to the questionnaire. Most respondents (68.7%) did not have any experience in a peer mentorship relationship during their MPT programme. A few respondents (5.4%) reported having received formal training on peer mentorship as part of their PT curriculum. Respondents generally held positive attitudes toward peer mentorship: 65.9% agreed that including peer mentorship is important, 89.5% agreed that peer mentorship can assist with learning in clinical internships, and 84.1% agreed that peer mentorship can help the transition from student to professional. Most respondents (52.5%) did not participate in a peer mentorship relationship during a typical month. MPT students' attitudes toward peer mentorship are positive, yet their knowledge of and resources for peer mentorship are limited, and few students have been involved in peer mentorship practices. The findings highlight the importance of university programme support to provide a nurturing environment and structure to overcome barriers, promote commitment, and facilitate successful participation. The evidence from this study provides a rationale to support and guide peer mentorship programming for Canadian MPT students. ","635":"","636":"The purpose of this study was to examine the concurrent validity of the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and to evaluate the accuracy of information obtained through self-report questionnaire versus interview formats. The study included 29 patients older than 60 years attending an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. Participants completed the LLFDI, three additional self-report criterion measures, and six performance-based tests; they completed the LLFDI a second time via interview. We used descriptive statistics, correlations, and t-tests to analyze the data. All LLFDI components were correlated (rs=0.36-0.83) with the self-report criterion measures. The Function Component of the LLFDI was moderately correlated with the 6-Minute Walk Test (r=0.62), timed up-and-go (r=-0.58), walking speed (r=-0.57), and timed sit-to-stand (r=-0.56) scores. The LLFDI demonstrated a ceiling effect (10%) only in the Disability Limitation component. All LLFDI component scores obtained via self-report questionnaire were correlated with scores obtained via interview; except in a single subcategory, there was no difference between LLFDI scores obtained through self-report questionnaire and those obtained through interview.

","637":"The purpose of this study was to reach consensus on the importance and feasibility of clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for physiotherapy practice for the prevention and management of overweight and obesity in Canadian adults. We used a modified Delphi method to achieve consensus. Participants rated the importance and feasibility of recommendations using a nine-point scale in two rounds of electronic surveys and a conference call. The mean and distribution of ratings were analyzed to determine consensus. Twenty-one physiotherapists experienced in the management of patients with obesity and representing diverse regions of Canada and areas of practice participated. Seventeen (81.0%) completed survey 1. Ten (47.6%) participated in the conference call and survey 2. Eight of 34 strategies received mean ratings of 7.00 or more for both importance and feasibility from at least two-thirds of participants. These strategies were related to physical activity prescription and assessment. A sample of physiotherapists in Canada agreed that obesity-related CPGs contain recommendations that are important to physiotherapy practice. These findings, along with the Canadian Physiotherapy Association's position statement on obesity, provide support for the argument that physiotherapists, as direct-access practitioners or members of multidisciplinary teams, should play a role in the health care of people with obesity and overweight. ","638":"The objective of this study was to compare hospital and home care employers' rankings of both the importance and the feasibility of workforce strategies for recruiting and retaining rehabilitation professionals. An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all employers of rehabilitation professionals in Ontario hospitals (n=144) and Community Care Access Centre home care providers (n=34). Importance and feasibility rankings were based on the percentage of high ratings; 95% CIs were used to determine significant differences between hospital and home care rankings of recruitment and retention strategies. The response rate was 50% (72\/144) from hospitals and 73.5% (25\/34) from home-care settings. The recruitment and retention strategies considered most important and feasible for rehabilitation therapists, regardless of setting, were communication between employer and worker, compensation packages, access to research, and professional development in budget planning. Tangible resources, support personnel, work safety, and marketing rehabilitation careers to high school students were ranked significantly higher by hospitals than by home care providers. Similarities exist between hospital and home care employers in terms of the importance and feasibility of recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation professionals. However, when developing a rehabilitation health human resources plan, the strategies identified as different between hospital and home care settings should be taken into account. ","639":"Our purpose was to determine advanced manual and manipulative physiotherapists' (AMPTs') current use and awareness of continuing education (CE) opportunities; to establish their perceived CE needs by identifying facilitators and barriers to participation; and to explore the association of demographics with CE needs. A questionnaire was e-mailed to 456 registered members of the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapy. Data analyses using frequencies and percentages of total responses and t-tests for group comparisons were performed. One hundred thirty-three (29.2%) participants responded. Most lived in an urban region and worked predominantly in direct patient care. More respondents reported engaging in informal CE than in formal CE. Hands-on or practical workshops were the preferred CE format. Common barriers to CE included professional commitments and cost and time of travel; facilitators included interest in the topic and increasing knowledge and competency. AMPTs with less physical therapy experience found cost to be a greater barrier and were more interested in mentorship programs and CE as a means to obtain credentials. AMPTs' preferred CE formats are inconsistent with the CE opportunities in which they participate. CE initiatives for AMPTs should include hands-on training and should account for time and cost to make CE opportunities more readily available to them.

Eighteen people over age 55 and living with MS for at least 20 years were recruited from an MS clinic and rehabilitation outpatient records. Interviews (60-80 min), using open-ended questions, explored participants' lifelong experiences of MS. Following interview transcription, data were coded and analyzed; themes, subthemes, and their relationships were described based on consensus. Participants recounted their diagnosis process, their life experience with MS, and how they eventually accepted their disease, adapted, and moved toward self-management. The findings included vivid descriptions of social relationships, health care interactions, overcoming barriers, and the emotions associated with living with MS. A conceptual model of phases of self-management, from diagnosis to integration of MS into a sense of self, was developed. Study participants valued self-management and described its phases, facilitators, and inhibitors from their points of view. Over years and decades, learning from life experiences, trial and error, and interactions with health care professionals, participants seemed to consolidate MS into their sense of self. Self-determination, social support, strong problem-solving abilities, and collaborative relationships with health professionals aided adaptation and coping. Findings from this study make initial steps toward understanding how MS self-management evolves over the life course and how self-management programmes can help people with MS begin to manage wellness earlier in their lives.

The applicable studies were organized into three categories: conventional therapies (CT), electrical stimulation therapies (ES), and surgical interventions (SI). The proportion of papers in each category that presented with sufficient methodological quality to contribute to best evidence was as follows: CT: 0\/2; ES: 10\/21; SI: 6\/20. ES therapies are beneficial as assistive technologies and as therapeutic intervention in the subacute phase of recovery. SIs are suitable for individuals who meet very specific criteria for tendon-transfer surgery. Further clinical trials are warranted for ES and SI therapies to substantiate prescription of therapeutics. ","646":"In this study, we characterized physiotherapists' attitudes and beliefs about the bio-psychosocial problem of low back pain (LBP), their use of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and the extent to which their advice and treatment is in line with best-evidence CPGs. One hundred eight physiotherapists completed an online survey that included questionnaires exploring the strength of physiotherapists' biomedical and bio-psychosocial orientations toward the management of LBP: the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists and the Attitudes to Back Pain Scale for musculoskeletal practitioners. In addition, participants responded to questions about treatment recommendations for patients in two vignettes. Only 12% of respondents were aware of CPGs. Physiotherapists with a stronger biomedical orientation scored the severity of spinal pathology higher in the patient vignettes. A stronger biomedical orientation was also associated with disagreement with recommendations to return to usual activity or work. The results suggest limited awareness by physiotherapists of best-evidence CPGs and contemporary understandings of LBP that support early activation and self-management. Research to better understand and facilitate the implementation of best-evidence professional education and clinical practice is an urgent priority. ","647":"Military physiotherapists in the Canadian Forces meet the unique rehabilitation needs of military personnel. Recently, the physiotherapy officer role has evolved in response to the Canadian Forces' involvement in the combat theatre of operations of Afghanistan, and this has created new and unique challenges and demands. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences and challenges of military physiotherapists deployed to Afghanistan. A qualitative research design guided by descriptive phenomenology involved recruitment of key informants and in-depth interviews as the data collection method. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the data analyzed using a foundational thematic analysis approach. Strategies of peer review and member checking were incorporated into the study design. Six military physiotherapists were interviewed. They described rewarding experiences that were stressful yet highly career-satisfying. Main challenges revolved around heavy workloads, an expanded scope of practice as sole-charge practitioners, and the consequences and criticality of their clinical decisions. Our findings suggest that enhanced pre-deployment training and the implementation of a stronger support network will improve the capabilities of military physiotherapists deployed to difficult theatres of operations. This type of systematic and comprehensive research is needed to assist the Canadian Forces in proactively preparing and supporting physiotherapists deployed on future missions.

The purpose of this study was to assess the patterns of and barriers to Internet use by CBR workers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Participants were CBR workers (physiotherapists, physiatrists, and technicians) from Bosnia and Herzegovina who attended a conference or workshop in 2005. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered in the local language to assess Internet use. Descriptive results were summarized in tables. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with Internet use. A total of 33% of respondents had never used the Internet. Common barriers to Internet use included \"not enough time\" (24%), \"no access\" (23%), and \"lack of skill\" (18%). Participants with higher levels of education had greater odds of using the Internet than physiotherapy school graduates (odds ratio=7.6, p=0.016) and had greater odds of using the Internet to obtain medical, rehabilitation, or health information (odds ratio=5.8, p=0.028). Improving CBR workers' access to the Internet and their proficiency in using it may enable them to obtain valuable rehabilitation-related information and enhance communication among CBR workers, potentially translating into improved rehabilitation services for people with disabilities in LMICs.

Three trained reviewers used standardized forms to extract data independently. We reviewed 58 charts of adult clients with inflammatory arthritis. Compared with experienced therapists, extended-role practitioners were more likely to receive referrals specifically for assessments (52% vs. 14%); to treat clients with undifferentiated arthritis (48% vs. 10%); to document comorbidities (90% vs. 66%); to advocate on behalf of the client with the client's family, physician, or specialist (52% vs. 21%); to recommend or provide exercise or physical activity (86% vs. 62%); to educate clients about pain management (41% vs. 28%), energy conservation (24% vs. 14%), and posture (21% vs. 7%); to recommend splints (41% vs. 31%); and to refer for or recommend radiologic or laboratory assessments (14% vs. 3%).

A score of zero in any trial of the SOT was registered as a fall. On the basis of the SOT results, participants were categorized as frequent fallers (two or more falls) or as fallers (one fall). To explore the potential influence of muscle weakness on postural control, knee extensors concentric muscle torque was assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer. Physical activity level was assessed with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. People with COPD showed a 10.8% lower score on the SOT (p=0.016) and experienced more falls (40) than the comparison group (12). The proportion of frequent fallers and fallers during the SOT was greater (p=0.021) in the COPD group (four of 10) than in the comparison group (two of seven). People with COPD showed deficits in knee extensors muscle strength (p=0.01) and a modest trend toward reduced physical activity level. However, neither of these factors explained the deficits in postural control observed in the COPD group. People with COPD show deficits in postural control and increased risk of falls as measured by the SOT. The deficits in postural control appear to be independent of muscle weakness and level of physical activity.

Researchers reviewed 28 administrative e-claim files for persons who sustained a work-related SCI between 1996 and 2000. Payment data were extracted for physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), and psychology services. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores were targeted as a surrogate measure for functional outcome. Feasibility was tested using an existing approach for evaluating health services data. The process of administrative e-claim file review was not practical for extraction of the targeted data. While administrative claim files contain some rehabilitation payment and outcome data, in their present form the data are not suitable to inform rehabilitation services research.

","666":"The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to provide an overview of the literature on barriers to evidence-based practice (EBP) and the effectiveness of implementation interventions in health care; and (2) to outline the development of an implementation intervention for improving the prescription of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) by physical therapists and other health professionals for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Individuals, organizations, and the research itself present barriers to EBP in physical therapy. Despite the evidence supporting the use of IMT, this treatment continues to be under-used in managing COPD. Current health services research shows that traditional information-based approaches to implementation, such as didactic lectures, do not adequately address the challenges health professionals face when trying to make changes in practice. We propose the development of a theory-based intervention to improve health professionals' use of IMT in the management of COPD. It is postulated that a behavioural intervention, based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), may be more effective than an information-based strategy in increasing the prescription of IMT by health professionals. TPB may be used to understand the antecedents of health professionals' behaviour and to guide the development of implementation interventions. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this proposed intervention in the management of people with COPD. ","667":"Pain is a significantly disabling problem that often interacts with other deficits during the rehabilitation process. The aim of this paper is to review evidence of interactions between pain and the motor cortex in order to attempt to answer the following questions: (1) Does acute pain interfere with motor-cortex activity? (2) Does chronic pain interfere with motor-cortex activity, and, conversely, does motor-cortex plasticity contribute to chronic pain? (3) Can the induction of motor plasticity by means of motor-cortex stimulation decrease pain? (4) Can motor training result in both motor-cortex reorganization and pain relief? Acute experimental pain has been clearly shown to exert an inhibitory influence over the motor cortex, which can interfere with motor learning capacities. Current evidence also suggests a relationship between chronic pain and motor-cortex reorganization, but it is still unclear whether one causes the other. However, there is growing evidence that interventions aimed at normalizing motor-cortex organization can lead to pain relief. Interactions between pain and the motor cortex are complex, and more studies are needed to understand these interactions in our patients, as well as to develop optimal rehabilitative strategies. ","668":"Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is a frequent outcome of musculoskeletal surgery. Physiotherapists often treat patients with pain before and after musculoskeletal surgery. The purposes of this paper are (1) to raise awareness of the nature, mechanisms, and significance of CPSP; and (2) to highlight the necessity for an inter-professional team to understand and address its complexity. Using total joint replacement surgeries as a model, we provide a review of pain mechanisms and pain management strategies. By understanding the mechanisms by which pain alters the body's normal physiological responses to surgery, clinicians selectively target pain in post-surgical patients through the use of multi-modal management strategies. Clinicians should not assume that patients receiving multiple medications have a problem with pain. Rather, the modern-day approach is to manage pain using preventive strategies, with the aims of reducing the intensity of acute postoperative pain and minimizing the development of CPSP. The roles of biological, surgical, psychosocial, and patient-related risk factors in the transition to pain chronicity require further investigation if we are to better understand their relationships with pain. Measuring pain intensity and analgesic use is not sufficient. Proper evaluation and management of risk factors for CPSP require inter-professional teams to characterize a patient's experience of postoperative pain and to examine pain arising during functional activities.

Perceived barriers to supervising students tended to be extrinsic: time and space constraints, challenging or difficult students, and decreased autonomy or flexibility for the clinical physical therapists. Benefits tended to be intrinsic: teaching provided personal gratification by promoting reflective practice and exposing clinical educators to current knowledge. The culture of different health care institutions was an important factor in therapists' perceptions of student supervision. Despite different disciplines and models of supervision, there is considerable synchronicity in the issues reported by physical therapists and other disciplines.

The ABC correlated with the TUG (r=-0.44, p=0.03) and with PDQ-8 (r(s)=0.51, p=0.01) and NUDS (r(s)=0.48, p=0.02) walking items. The ABC was able to discriminate between stages 1 and 3 of disease progression but not between stages 1 and 2, which suggests that the ABC can distinguish large differences in disease progression but cannot detect more subtle differences. Homogeneity of the ABC, PDQ-8, and SSE is good to excellent. Test-retest reliability scores of all measures except the NUDS are moderate to good. The ABC is a valid measure for use in PD. The MDC statistic may be useful for interpreting group score changes. ","703":"","704":"The purpose of this study was to develop a paediatric cardiopulmonary physiotherapy (CPT) discharge tool. We report on the initial stages of its development and the tool's sensibility (face\/content validity, feasibility, and ease of usage). Using a modified Delphi technique, a panel of paediatric physiotherapy clinicians and academic leaders in the area of CPT (n=25) was recruited. Four rounds of discussion among the members of the Delphi panel focused on (1) generation of discharge items, (2) reduction of items, (3) discussion of contentious items and refinement of criterion definitions, and (4) determination of scoring options for the test instrument. The sensibility of a draft of the tool was assessed using a sample of convenience (n=15). Six items (auscultation, discharge planning, mobility, oxygen saturation, secretion clearance, and signs of respiratory distress) were identified for inclusion in the tool. The global mean of all sensibility domains was 6.4 (median=6.6) of a possible 7.0. Using a modified Delphi process, we developed a six-item paediatric CPT discharge planning tool with good face and content validity. Future work will determine the scoring method for using this tool, interrater reliability, and predictive validity to facilitate optimal timing of hospital discharge for paediatric CPT patients. ","705":"As part of the special series on pain, our objectives are to describe the key features of chronic pain in children, present the rationale for interdisciplinary treatment, report a case study based on our biopsychosocial approach, and highlight the integral role of physiotherapy in reducing children's pain and improving function. We also evaluate the evidence base supporting physiotherapy for treating chronic neuropathic pain in children. Chronic pain affects many children and adolescents. Certain challenging pain conditions begin primarily during adolescence and disproportionately affect girls and women. Children with these conditions require an interdisciplinary treatment programme that includes physiotherapy as well as medication and\/or psychological intervention. Converging lines of evidence from cohort follow-up studies, retrospective chart reviews, and one randomized controlled trial support the effectiveness of physiotherapy within an interdisciplinary programme for treating children with chronic pain. Evidence-based practice dictates that health care providers adopt clear guidelines for determining when treatments are effective and for identifying children for whom such treatments are most effective. Thus, additional well-designed trials are required to better identify the specific physiotherapy modalities that are most important in improving children's pain and function.

We applied a variable-occasion repeated-measures study design. Patients' knee flexion and extension ROM were assessed pre- and post arthroplasty over the ensuing 60 weeks. We examined change in ROM post TKA using linear and nonlinear mixed-effects modelling, and examined whether age, body mass index, prearthroplasty ROM, and gender were determinants of recovery in post-arthroplasty ROM. Of 93 eligible patients, 74 provided pre- and post-arthroplasty data. A random intercept nonlinear model fit the flexion data best, and a random intercept linear model fit the extension data best. Pre-arthroplasty ROM was found to be a determinant of recovery in ROM post arthroplasty. This finding was common to both flexion and extension models. Our study showed that the greatest improvement for knee ROM took place during the first 12 weeks post arthroplasty. Of the variables examined, only pre-arthroplasty ROM was a determinant of outcome (p&lt;0.05).

Key barriers are outlined, and potentially effective strategies to improve implementation are presented. Although pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended by international guidelines as part of the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), participation in PR remains low. Physician referral to PR ranges from 3% to 16% of suitable patients. Barriers to participation include limited availability of suitable programmes and interrelated issues of referral and access. Individual patient barriers, including factors relating to comorbidities and exacerbations, perceptions of benefit, and ease of access, contribute less overall to low participation rates. Chronic care programmes that incorporate self-management support have some benefit in patients with COPD. However, the demonstrated cost-effectiveness of PR is substantial, and efforts to improve its implementation are urgently indicated. To improve implementation, a holistic examination of the key issues influencing a patient's participation in PR is needed. Such an examination should consider the relative influences of environmental (e.g., health-service-related) factors, organizational factors (e.g., referral and intake procedures), and individual factors (e.g., patient barriers) for all participants. On the basis of these findings, policy, funding, service delivery, and other interventions to improve participation in PR can be developed and evaluated.

The direct involvement of children in health-related research is important for maintaining and improving standards of paediatric clinical care. Ethical considerations around investigations involving this highly vulnerable population are complex, however, requiring the involvement of many levels of decision makers-government, research ethics boards (REBs), health care providers, parents, and children. The Miller and Kenny framework is useful in distinguishing these levels and heightening awareness of the complexities of the issues around engaging children in research. Considerations include the role of parents\/caregivers in decision making, individual assessment of the child's decisional capacities, close attention to the child's context and life experience, provision of developmentally appropriate information about the research study, and careful assessment of dissent prior to withdrawing the child from the study. Physical therapists involved in paediatric clinical practice and\/or research must be knowledgeable about ethical principles, policies, and REB requirements. The Miller and Kenny framework is a helpful guide to clarify decision-making roles around children's participation in research. ","720":"This article provides an overview of literature relevant to the prevention and relief of pain and distress during physiotherapy procedures, with guidance for physiotherapists treating children. Physiotherapists are generally well trained in assessing and managing pain as a symptom of injury or disease, but there is a need to improve the identification and management of pain produced by physiotherapy procedures such as stretching and splinting. In contrast to physiotherapy, other health care disciplines, such as dentistry, nursing, paediatrics, emergency medicine, and paediatric psychology, produce extensive literature on painful procedures. Procedural pain in children is particularly important because it can lead to later fear and avoidance of necessary medical care. We emphasize the need for physiotherapists to recognize procedural pain and fear in the course of treatment using verbal, nonverbal, and contextual cues. We present many methods that physiotherapists can use to prevent or relieve procedural pain and fear in paediatric patients and provide an example of a simple, integrated plan for prevention and relief of distress induced by painful procedures.

This report describes a private outpatient program providing treatment services to patients with long-term disabling pain arising from work- or accident-related musculoskeletal injuries. The cohort consists of 338 consecutive patients who completed the program over a 3-year period (patients discharged between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007). Improvements in vocational status were noted in 75% of patients with chronic pain. Patients were also able to reduce their pain levels by approximately 16% and to reduce their levels of anxiety and depression by 13% and 17% respectively. At the same time, 61% of patients were able to reduce or eliminate their pain medications. Outcomes are consistent with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain conditions. The published literature supports the efficacy of this interdisciplinary approach in highly disabled patients for whom effective treatment has been delayed. Early intervention in the subacute phase is recommended for prevention of long-term disability in patients with chronic pain.

During the interview, the patient reported that he was receiving signals from an electronic device implanted in his body.Measures and outcome: The physical therapist's initial assessment identified a disorder requiring medical referral. Further management of the patient's musculoskeletal dysfunction was not appropriate at this time. The patient was referred for further medical investigation, as he was demonstrating signs suggestive of a psychiatric disorder. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia by a psychiatrist and was prescribed Risperdal.

The patient was a 65-year-old woman with multiple fall-related traumas, including right wrist, thumb, and patellar fractures and left thigh muscle strain with significant ecchymosis and effusion. Medical history included HH. Iron-related lab values had been analyzed 9 days prior to the fall and had demonstrated a steady increase over the previous 4 months since her last phlebotomy. As the level of exercise and activity increased during the course of PT treatment, the patient developed shortness of breath and increased fatigue. The exercise level in therapy was reduced to accommodate the change in the patient's response. Blood values analyzed 7 weeks after the fall demonstrated a drop in haemoglobin and hematocrit values, while serum ferritin levels had risen.

Functional mobility was evaluated at four time points during two cycles of a 12-week exercise programme, alternating with a 12-week period of no formal exercise. The primary outcome was the change in functional mobility scores, assessed at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. In both the higher-functioning (HF) group and the lower-functioning (LF) group, the cessation of exercise was associated with deterioration in physical function. The overall non-continuous nature of the programming under study also seemed to be detrimental to the physical function of the LF group.

Nine sites provided cardiorespiratory treatment on POD-3. On POD-1, patients were dangled at 17 sites and mobilized out of bed at 13. By POD-3, patients ambulated 50-120 m per session 2-5 times per day. Sternal precautions were variable, but the lifting limit was reported as ranging between 5 lb and 10 lb. Canadian physical therapists reported the provision of cardiorespiratory treatment after POD-1.

Half the sample was enrolled in a physiotherapy intervention only; the other half was enrolled in a psychosocial intervention in addition to receiving a physiotherapy intervention. At post-treatment, the two treatment groups did not differ significantly on measures of pain severity, physical function, or self-reported disability. Patients who participated in the psychosocial intervention in addition to physiotherapy showed significantly greater reductions in pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, and depression than patients who received only the physiotherapy intervention. Reductions in psychosocial risk factors contributed to reduced use of the health care system, reduced use of pain medication, and improved return-to-work outcomes.

This paper is intended to provide practice guidelines for pain assessment among older persons with dementia. Over the last several years, there has been tremendous research progress in this area. While more research is needed, several promising assessment methodologies are available. These methodologies most often involve the use of observational checklists to record specific pain behaviours. We encourage the ongoing and regular evidence-based pain assessment of older persons with dementia, using standardized procedures. Without regular and systematic assessment, pain problems will often go undetected in this population.

Selected studies were assessed by two independent investigators for methodological quality, using the PEDro scale. Ten prospective cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Quality-assessment scores averaged 5\/10 on the PEDro scale, with two articles obtaining a score of 6\/10. The majority of studies found that individuals participating in higher levels of physical activity had a reduced risk of cancer-related mortality. This trend was observed specifically for breast, colon, and colorectal cancers. On average, it appears that engaging in higher levels of metabolic equivalent hours per week may help to improve survival rates among individuals diagnosed with cancer.

A sample of 76 consecutive patients with anterior knee pain was further subdivided into PFPS and other diagnoses. Routine physical examination tests were examined in a prospective, consecutive-subjects design for a cohort of patients with anterior knee pain. Diagnostic accuracy findings, including sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive value, and positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios, were calculated for each test. PPV and NPV reflect the percentage of time of positive or a negative test (respectively) accurately captures the diagnosis of the condition. LR+ and LR- reflect alterations in post-test probability when the test is positive or negative (respectively). Lastly, associations to disability (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective form) were calculated for each clinical finding. Diagnostic accuracy analyses of individual functional assessment and situational phenomena suggest that the strongest diagnostic test is pain encountered during resisted muscle contraction of the knee (PPV=82%; LR+=2.2; 95% CI: 0.99-5.2). Clusters of test findings were substantially more diagnostic, with any two of three positive findings of muscle contraction, pain during squatting, and pain during palpation yielding the following values: PPV=89%; LR+=4.0 (95% CI: 1.8-10.3). No individual or clustered test findings were significantly associated with the IKDC score.

Seven of nine audiotaped interviews (49 participants) were of sufficient quality to be transcribed and imported into qualitative data analysis software for thematic analysis. Participants described the challenges of including charting in their routine client care. Barriers included the disjuncture between charting and thinking, the translation of impairment goals to functional goals, the time it takes to chart, fear of failure, and the difficulty of predicting length of treatment. Strategies to facilitate charting were suggested by participants. Understanding barriers to charting in private practice is necessary to improve the quality of documentation. Barriers described are related to the fast-moving nonverbal, kinaesthetic, and cognitive process that is clinical reasoning in physiotherapy.

Strategies to facilitate charting noted by participants address some of these issues; however, a broader, profession-wide discussion is necessary. ","766":"Strenuous upper-extremity activity and\/or exercise have traditionally been prescribed for breast cancer survivors with or at risk of developing lymphedema. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of an acute bout of exercise on upper-limb volume and symptoms in breast cancer survivors, with the intent to provide pilot data to guide a subsequent larger study. Twenty-three women who regularly participated in dragon-boat racing took part in the study. A single exercise bout was performed at a moderate intensity (rating of perceived exertion: 13-14) for 20 continuous minutes on an arm ergometer. The difference between affected and unaffected limb volume was assessed pre- and post-exercise via measurements of limb circumference at five time points. Although limb volume increased following exercise in both limbs, the difference between the limbs remained stable at each measurement point. Only one participant was found to have an increase in arm-volume difference of &gt;100 ml post intervention, and only four participants reported symptoms of tension and\/or heaviness in the affected limb. The results suggest that limb volume in breast cancer survivors increases after an acute bout of upper-limb exercise but that, for the majority of women, the response is not different between affected and unaffected limbs. Future research using a larger sample and more sensitive measurement methods are recommended. ","767":"To (1) assess whether physiotherapists in a large Canadian province support the offering of a clinical master's degree programme; (2) identify what sector of this population is interested in participating in a clinical master's degree programme; (3) identify the most common personal\/professional reasons for enrolling; (4) identify the type of programme that would appeal; and (5) assess barriers to participation in such a programme. The survey and accompanying cover letter explaining the study were sent by postal mail to all 2,552 physiotherapists registered with the College of Physical Therapists of British Columbia (CPTBC). The response rate was 17%; 90% of respondents support offering this type of physiotherapy degree in BC, and 14% reported that they were likely to enrol. Orthopaedics\/manual therapy (41%) was the clinical area of most interest. There is strong support for a clinical master's degree in orthopaedic manual therapy in BC. There is greater support for a part-time programme with an inter-professional component, using a combination of e-learning and classroom teaching to reduce travel time and time away from family. ","768":"Ambulatory physical therapy (PT) services in Canada are required to be insured under the Canada Health Act, but only if delivered within hospitals. The present study analyzed strategic responses used by hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to deliver PT services in an environment of fiscal constraint. Key informant interviews (n = 47) were conducted with participants from all hospitals located within the GTA. Two primary strategic responses were identified: (1) \"load shedding\" through the elimination or reduction of services, and (2) \"privatization\" through contracting out or creating internal for-profit subsidiary clinics. All hospitals reported reductions in service delivery between 1996 and 2003, and 15.0% (7\/47 hospitals) fully eliminated ambulatory services. Although only one of 47 hospitals contracted out services, another 15.0% (7\/47) reported that for-profit subsidiary clinics were created within the hospital in order to access other more profitable forms of quasi-public and private funding. Strategic restructuring of services, aimed primarily at cost containment, may have yielded short-term financial savings but has also created a ripple effect across the continuum of care. Moreover, the rise of for-profit subsidiary clinics operating within not-for-profit hospitals has emerged without much public debate and with little research to evaluate its impact. ","769":"Moving On after STroke (MOST) is an established self-management programme for persons with stroke and their care partners. Through 18 sessions over 9 weeks, each including discussion and exercise, participants learn about goal-setting, problem-solving, exercise, and community-reintegration skills. This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of telehealth delivery of MOST. Efficacy was evaluated using an experimental non-randomized trial comparing a telehealth MOST intervention group (T-MOST) (n = 10) with a waiting list control group (WLC) (n = 8). Outcome measures included the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Reintegration to Normal Living Index, the Stroke-Adapted Sickness Impact Profile, Goal Attainment Scaling, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. The feasibility evaluation included attendance rates, focus groups, and facilitator logs. In MOST Telehealth, one co-facilitator was local and the other was connected by videoconference. Attendance rates for persons with stroke (83.9%, SD = 2.6) and care partners (76.7%, SD = 2.9) and participant and facilitator experiences indicated feasibility of this mode of programme delivery. There was a significant difference in BBS scores between the T-MOST group and the WLC group (mean difference -4.27, 95%CI: -6.66 to -1.87). Participants reported additional benefits, including increased motivation and awareness of partners' needs. Videoconferencing was reported to decrease their sense of isolation. It appears feasible to deliver the MOST programme with two facilitators, one connected by videoconference and one in person. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that the programme is associated with improved well-being in persons with stroke and their care partners. Practitioners delivering self-management programmes may consider wider dissemination using videoconferencing. ","770":"To describe previously reported locomotor muscle and whole-body composition factors related to mobility in older individuals. A narrative review of the literature, including a combination of search terms related to muscle and whole-body composition factors and to mobility in older individuals, was carried out. Statistical measures of association and risk were consolidated to summarize the common effects between studies. Fifty-three studies were reviewed. Muscle and whole-body factors accounted for a substantial amount of the variability in walking speed, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.30 to 0.47. Muscle power consistently accounted for a greater percentage of the variance in mobility than did strength. Risks associated with high fat mass presented a minimum odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 and a maximum OR of 4.07, while the minimum and maximum ORs associated with low lean mass were 0.87 and 2.30 respectively. Whole-body and regional fat deposits accounted for significant amounts of the variance in mobility. Muscle power accounts for a greater amount of the variance in the level of mobility in older individuals than does muscle strength. Whole-body fat accounts for a greater amount of the variance in level of mobility than does whole-body lean tissue. Fat stored within muscle also appears to increase the risk of a mobility limitation in older individuals. ","771":"To investigate the factorial and construct validity of a four-item pain intensity scale, the P4, in patients awaiting primary total hip or knee arthroplasty secondary to osteoarthritis. A construct validation design was applied to a sample of convenience of 117 patients (mean age 65.6 [SD = 11.2] years) at their preoperative visit. All patients completed the P4 and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the factorial structure of the P4 and WOMAC. To evaluate construct validity, we examined the correlation between the P4 and WOMAC pain sub-scales and the ability of the P4 to differentiate between patients awaiting hip and knee replacement. Two distinct factors consistent with the themes of pain and function were identified with P4 and WOMAC physical function items, but not with the WOMAC pain and physical function items. The P4 correlates more with the WOMAC pain scores (r = 0.67) than with the WOMAC physical function scores (r = 0.60). The P4's validity was supported in this patient group. The use of the P4 with the WOMAC physical function sub-scale provides a more distinct assessment of pain and function than the WOMAC pain and physical function scales.

The aims of this study were (1) to survey physiotherapy practice of oxygen administration in Ontario hospitals and (2) to determine the proportion and characteristics of hospitals with delegation policies for physiotherapists to administer oxygen. Postal surveys were sent to 208 hospitals. Data were collected on hospital characteristics; the presence of delegation policies; and the practice and training of physiotherapists, physiotherapy assistants, and students in oxygen administration. Data were described by summative statistics. Fisher's exact test and Cramer's V statistic were used to examine associations. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed using logistic regression. Response rate was 82.7%. Physiotherapists administered oxygen in 39% of hospitals, and 28% of hospitals had delegation policies. Larger, urban, or teaching hospitals and those with a matrix structure were most likely to have delegation policies and physiotherapists who administered oxygen. Rehabilitation hospitals were also likely to have such policies. Physiotherapists administer oxygen in less than half of Ontario hospitals, very few of which have delegation policies.

This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects on gait symmetry of ambulating with a standard cane and a quad cane among individuals with subacute stroke. A within-subject experimental design was used to evaluate symmetry in in-patients with subacute stroke during ambulation on a pressure-sensitive walkway for three task conditions: with no cane, with standard single-point cane, and with quad cane. Fourteen patients were classified as symmetric (n = 5) or asymmetric (n = 9) based on their gait symmetry while walking without an aid. Overall, use of a standard cane during ambulation significantly improved symmetry in asymmetric patients (p = 0.028). In contrast, the use of a quad cane did not improve symmetry (p = 0.36). There was no effect on symmetry in symmetric patients with use of either a standard cane (p = 0.88) or a quad cane (p = 0.32). These results indicate that the immediate effect of a standard cane is to improve symmetry in patients with subacute stroke who have asymmetric gait. Future studies are required to determine the long-term effects of canes on gait symmetry in this population.

Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search terms used were \"metastatic or advanced or palliative AND cancer or neoplasms AND exercise or physical activity or exercise therapy or physical fitness.\" The search identified 8 studies published in 10 articles between 2000 and 2007. Two quality-assessment tools were used, and levels of evidence were assigned according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) guidelines. Of the eight studies, three were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five were case series. Because three of the RCTs were based on the same sample, only one was included in the results and discussion sections. CEBM levels of evidence ranged from 2b to 4. Two overall recommendations were made, one grade A and one grade C. Exercise interventions ranged from aerobic exercise and strength training to multidimensional programmes with exercise as one component. All studies used physical and\/or quality-of-life outcome measures. Review findings suggest that exercise may be beneficial for persons with metastatic cancer.

Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to June 2008. Study quality was appraised using the Jadad and PEDro scales. Meta-analyses were reported as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Four randomized trials were accepted. For development of a PE, the pooled relative risks for ambulation and compression versus bed rest and compression (RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.34-1.19) and for ambulation and compression versus bed rest alone (RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.57-3.29) were not significant. For progression of an existing thrombus or development of a new thrombus, the independent relative risks for ambulation and compression versus bed rest and compression (RR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.13-1.14) and for ambulation and compression versus bed rest alone (RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.20-1.57) were also not significant. Given the clinical benefits of mobility, and because there was no significant difference between ambulation and bed rest for risk of developing a PE or development and progression of a new DVT in any of the studies, clinicians should be confident in prescribing ambulation in this population.

Sixty-eight respiratory physiotherapists recruited from the United Kingdom's Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care agreed to participate in a Delphi study. Clinicians' opinion of when NSI should be used was established and developed into statements. Level of agreement with each statement was collated through three rounds of a questionnaire. Clinicians' experiences were also reported. From the 52 responses to the third questionnaire, there was consensus that respiratory physiotherapists in the United Kingdom would use NSI when sputum retention is a problem, particularly when treatment options are limited (96%) and when sputum is obstructing the airway (92%). They agreed that non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage can be used to resolve persistent atelectasis (70%). They would not use NSI for a test treatment during initial assessment without evidence of retained secretions (94%), when secretions are copious but can be cleared by alternative physiotherapy techniques (96%), to enhance a cough unless very strong evidence indicates retained secretions (81%), or to compensate for inadequate suction technique (90%).

A chart audit of discharged workers was conducted over three episodes of care: 4-6 weeks (T1), 6-8 weeks (T2), and 8-10 weeks (T3) post-injury. The prevalence and reproducibility of parameters for common interventions were calculated as the percentage of active charts over time. Focus groups were used to validate audit results and deepen our understanding of practice. In all, 164 charts were audited. The most prevalent interventions were (1) for manual therapy, joint mobilization and traction; (2) for electrophysical agents (EPAs), heat, ultrasound, and interferential therapy; and (3) for exercise, core stabilization exercises. Transcript analyses revealed that participants viewed injured workers with SA-LBP in a positive light, emphasized the importance of physiotherapy, and discussed SA-LBP in five themes: time frame, non-specific diagnosis, mixed client outlook, change in pain presentation, and the transition from a passive to a more active treatment approach. The pattern of decreasing passive and increasing active interventions is consistent with the focus-group participants' description of how they approach treatment of clients with SA-LBP. Also noted was a higher prevalence of interventions poorly supported by evidence and lower prevalence of interventions well supported by evidence. ","783":"This study's purposes were to examine the measurement properties of the 2-minute walk test (2MWT), to illustrate the use of reliability coefficients in clinical practice, and to estimate sample size for a subsequent validity study. Sixteen residents of long-term care (LTC; mean age = 87 years) completed two 2MWTs with Rater A and two 2MWTs with Rater B on test days 1 and 2, approximately 1 week apart. On a third test day, subjects completed one trial of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), timed up-and-go (TUG) test, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) with Rater A. On 2 other test days, approximately 1 week apart, Rater A administered the 2MWT to five older adults living in a retirement facility. Absolute and relative reliability and concurrent and known-groups validity coefficients were calculated. No main effect for rater, trial, or occasion was found. Test-retest reliability estimates of 0.94 and 0.95 were obtained. The 2MWT demonstrated concurrent validity (r &gt; or = 0.84) with the BBS, TUG, and 6MWT. Comparison of distance walked by LTC and retirement residents showed a difference of 72.9 m (95% CI: 44.2, 101.6). The results suggest that 90% of truly stable older adults will display random fluctuations in 2MWT performance within a boundary of 15 m. The 2MWT had sound measurement properties in this sample of LTC residents. Based on our results, 24 subjects would be required for a subsequent hypothesis-testing validity study. ","784":"The purpose of this article is to apply theoretical frameworks to adherence behaviour and to guide the development of an intervention to increase adherence to prescribed home programmes. Delivering an effective intervention requires establishing one that is evidence based and of adequate dosage. Two-thirds of patients who receive home exercise prescriptions do not adhere to their home programme, which may contribute to their physiotherapy's being ineffective. The mediating concepts of self-efficacy (SE) and outcome expectations (OE) are common to the five relevant theories used to explain adherence to exercise: the health belief model, protection motivation theory, theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behaviour, and social cognitive theory. Few intervention studies with any theoretical underpinning have examined adherence to exercise. Even fewer have been designed to affect and measure change in the theoretical mediators of SE and OE in patient populations. Physiotherapists must consider increasing adherence as a component of effective physiotherapy. Ongoing research is needed to increase our understanding of adherence to prescribed home programmes and to design interventions to affect theoretical mediators for increasing adherence.

Stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the relationships between dependent and independent variables. The study cohort consisted of 236 candidates for TKA (154 women and 82 men, mean age 67, SD = 9.98). Expectations were high on average. Presence of comorbidity was associated with expectations of pain relief. Preoperative mental health was related to expectations for a return to activities of daily living; age, gender, physical health, and mental health were related to expectations for improved leisure, recreational, and sports activities. Preoperative physical health was related to expectations for potential return to full recovery. No baseline factors were associated with expectations for improved range of motion or for providing care to and interacting with others.

A retrospective longitudinal chart review was conducted for 300 persons, 65 years of age and older, who presented to the ED of a community-based teaching hospital with a fall from June 2004 through May 2005. Data were collected using a tool created by the investigators (based on information gathered through a literature review) to capture information related to risk factors for falling. Our study sample was demographically similar to elderly individuals in other fall-related studies. Most patients discharged directly from the ED did not receive multidisciplinary care. In the ED, all patients saw a nurse or physician, while only 1.3% (n = 4) saw a physical therapist, 3.0% (n = 9) saw an occupational therapist, and 5.3% (n = 16) saw a social worker. At discharge, 62% (n = 152) had no documented referral for follow-up care. Abilities related to falls in elderly individuals were not consistently assessed in the ED.

Patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and the alternative care phase immediately following formed the cohort for this case series. In an earlier RCT, patients with directional preference were randomized to exercises\/advice matched to their individual directional preference or to one of two unmatched protocols. The primary inclusion criterion for our case series was patient reports of being unchanged or worse following 2 weeks' treatment in the RCT. The secondary inclusion criterion was patient requests for \"a change to one of the other stretching protocols to see if I can achieve better pain control.\" Patients meeting either of these criteria were offered matched exercises\/advice if they had not previously received this intervention. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and McNemar tests compared outcomes during two consecutive time intervals: baseline to 2 weeks and 2 weeks to discharge. Dropouts were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Four patients from the matched group met the primary inclusion criterion of \"unchanged\" (none reported being worse); 10 additional patients requested alternative treatment for better pain control (secondary criterion). Eighty-five patients from the two unmatched treatment groups met all the inclusion criteria, and an additional 22 patients met only the secondary criterion.

Aquatic exercise (AE) may improve function and balance, thus ultimately decreasing fall risk and the potential for hip fractures in this high-risk population. A total of 68 women with OP, aged 60 years or older, were recruited into a randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of AE, land exercise (LE), and no exercise (NE) on balance, functional mobility, and quality of life (QOL). Only one balance measure (backward tandem walk) significantly improved with AE compared to LE, but this did not translate into a greater improvement in self-report function. There were no significant differences between the exercise interventions and NE, except for in ratings of global change, where participants in the AE group were three times more likely to report improvement than those in the NE group. There were no differences in balance, function, or QOL in women with OP who followed an AE or LE programme compared to those in an NE control group. However, the significant differences in backward tandem walk between the AE and LE groups and self-reported global change between the AE and NE groups warrant further investigation.

Sixty-five volunteers who met the eligibility criteria and had complete follow-up data were included in the analysis. The mean age was 38.8 years (minimum 18, maximum 64); 38 (58.5%) were men. The median time since onset of low back pain was 30 days. Cluster analysis was used to categorize patients into groups according to pain severity scores (VAS). Two distinct clusters-severe pain and moderate pain-emerged. There were significant differences in depressive and anxiety symptoms between the pain profiles. Further, return-to-work rates varied significantly between the two groups (31% in the severe pain cluster compared to 90% in the moderate pain cluster). Although both groups showed significant improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms over time, the severe pain cluster scored higher at discharge (higher scores indicating worse outcomes). These results highlight the importance of early identification of sub-groups at risk so that rehabilitation interventions can be focused with the goal of minimizing long-term disability. ","812":"Opportunities to expand the role of physical therapists (PTs) have evolved to include clinical specialists and advanced practitioners, although the literature on these roles is limited. We examined perceptions of PTs and PT employers in Ontario regarding clinical specialization and advanced practice. Using a modified Dillman approach, a cross-sectional survey was conducted with 500 PTs and 500 PT employers in Ontario. Questionnaires were tailored to address specific issues related to each cohort. Sixty percent of PTs and 53% of PT employers responded to the survey. Thirty-three percent of PT respondents already considered themselves \"clinical specialists\" (CS), and 8% considered themselves \"advanced practitioners\" (AP), although neither role is yet formally recognized in Canada. Both groups had substantial interest in pursuing formal recognition of CS and AP status. Respondents indicated that their primary motivation to pursue such roles was to enhance clinical reasoning skills with the goal of improving client outcomes (82% for the role of CS, 71% for the role of AP). Respondents supported the involvement of academic institutions in the process (60% for CS, 70% for AP). PTs and PT employers are supportive of the roles of the CS and AP within the profession, even though there is currently no formal recognition of either role in Canada. ","813":"We systematically reviewed randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials in the literature to assess the efficacy of neck stabilization and postural exercises on pain, neck range of motion, and time off work in adults with acute whiplash-associated disorders. Electronic databases, reference lists of relevant Cochrane reviews, reference lists of studies selected for inclusion, and tables of contents of relevant journals were systematically searched for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. Two independent reviewers selected studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Because of the heterogeneity of the interventions, a qualitative synthesis was performed using \"levels of evidence\" as recommended by van Tulder et al. Eight studies representing five clinical trials were selected for inclusion. Two trials were graded as high quality, two as moderate quality, and one as low quality. Many of these studies had mixed results, demonstrating significant differences on some outcome measures but not on others. There is moderate evidence to support the use of postural exercises for decreasing pain and time off work in the treatment of patients with acute whiplash-associated disorders. However, no evidence exists to support the use of postural exercises for increasing neck range of motion. There is conflicting evidence in support of neck stabilization exercises in the treatment of patients with acute whiplash-associated disorders. ","814":"","815":"","816":"The purposes of this study were to quantitatively examine hip abductor strength in patients presenting with iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) and to determine whether a multi-modal physiotherapy approach, including hip abductor strengthening, might play a role in recovery. Our observational, pretest-posttest study is one of the first prospective studies in this area. Patients presenting to physiotherapy with unilateral ITBFS were recruited to participate. Participants followed a 6-week rehabilitation programme designed to strengthen hip abductors; strength was measured every 2 weeks using a hand-held dynamometer and compared bilaterally. Sixteen subjects (five men, 11 women) aged 20 to 53 years participated. All but 2 reported running as one of their main physical activities. A trend toward a significant difference in hip abductor strength was found between the injured and uninjured sides at baseline, but this difference disappeared by 6 weeks. Hip abductor strength was significantly related to physical function at weeks 2, 4, and 6. Nine subjects were discharged from physiotherapy after the 6-week period, while the other 7 subjects continued attending for up to 5 months. Hip abductor strengthening appeared to be beneficial in the treatment of ITBFS, but further research on the use of hip abductor strengthening for treatment and prevention of ITBFS is needed. ","817":"The purposes of this study were to characterize the cardiorespiratory capacity of individuals on admission to inpatient rehabilitation following stroke and to examine the relationship between measures of cardiorespiratory capacity and standard indices of neurological deficit and functional status. We recruited 45 patients within the first 10 days of admission to rehabilitation. We performed measures of aerobic fitness (VO(2)peak), functional status (Functional Independence Measure [FIM] and Clinical Outcomes Variable Score [COVS]), and neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] and Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment scale [CMSA]). Nineteen women and 26 men with a mean (SD) age of 65.2 (14.5) years were admitted to rehabilitation 16.2 (11.9) (minimum 3, maximum 62) days post-stroke. Average VO(2)peak was less than half the value expected in age-matched healthy individuals at 11.1 (3.1) ml\/kg\/min. The associations between VO(2)peak and FIM, NIHSS, and COVS were weak (r = 0.25, -0.12, and 0.26 respectively, p = 0.12, 0.46, and 0.10 respectively). There were no differences in VO(2)peak in higher-functioning individuals with CMSA leg scores of 5 and 6 compared to lower-functioning individuals with scores of 3 and 4 (p = 0.30). Cardiorespiratory capacity is extremely low in individuals during the first 3 months after stroke. Alternative measures of functional or clinical status do not adequately reflect this cardiorespiratory state; thus, routine measurement of cardiorespiratory capacity should be considered, along with a risk-factor profile. ","818":"Laboratory studies confirm that constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves upper-extremity (UE) function after stroke. Due to strict patient criteria and the intensive resources required, CIMT has been slow to become part of rehabilitation practice. Our purpose was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an adapted experimental protocol within an outpatient clinical setting for a patient with moderate to severe UE impairment who did not meet traditional CIMT criteria. AJ, a 16-year-old male, experienced a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke due to carotid artery dissection one year before beginning CIMT. He demonstrated some proximal movement but no wrist or finger extension. He had received intensive rehabilitation for 12 months prior to beginning CIMT. Two occupational therapists and two physiotherapists collaborated to provide CIMT task training for 6 hours daily for 2 weeks. A knitted mitten extending to the elbow restrained the less-involved UE during 90% of waking hours. Tasks were tailored to AJ's interests, with the goal of integrating his affected UE into his behavioural repertoire. MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: After 2 weeks of CIMT, AJ improved in all measures (grip and lateral pinch strength, Action Research Arm Test [ARAT], and Box and Block Test) except the Chedoke McMaster Impairment Inventory. Greatest gains were seen at 6 months in the ARAT and Box and Block Test, which coincided with patient and family reports of AJ's using his arm in everyday functional tasks. Shared workload, emphasis on relevant functional tasks, and complete family participation likely influenced the success of CIMT. Our findings suggest that the strict CIMT criteria used in previous studies may exclude patients who might benefit from the treatment. Controlled trials should be undertaken to examine the effects of CIMT in patients with moderate to severe UE impairment. ","819":"The capacity of eccentric actions to produce muscle hypertrophy, strength gains, and neural adaptations without stressing the cardiopulmonary system has led to the prescription of eccentric training programmes in patients with low tolerance to exercise, such as elders or those with chronic health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the evidence regarding the effectiveness and suitability of eccentric training to restore musculoskeletal function in patients with chronic diseases. Relevant articles were identified from nine databases and from the reference lists of key articles. Articles were assessed to determine level of evidence and scientific rigour. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. According to Sackett's levels of evidence, 7 studies were graded at level IIb, 1 study at level IV, and the remaining study at level V. Articles were also graded for scientific rigour according to the PEDro scale. One study was rated as high quality, 4 studies were rated as moderate, and 2 studies were graded as poor quality. Eccentric training may be safely used to restore musculoskeletal function in patients with some specific chronic conditions. However, the heterogeneity of diseases makes it very difficult to extrapolate results and to standardize clinical recommendations for adequate implementation of this type of exercise. More studies are needed to establish the potential advantages of eccentric training in chronic conditions. ","820":"The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence from studies examining the effect of exercise interventions on stereotypic behaviours in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Only exercise-related physical therapy (PT) interventions were included. A multifaceted search strategy identified studies published between 1980 and 2007. Quality was assessed using the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM) Study Quality Scale, the Clinical Relevance Tool for Case Studies, and the Quality, Rigour or Evaluative Criteria tool. Seven studies (1982-2003) met our inclusion criteria; four of these used single-subject research designs, two were group studies, and one was a case study. Ages and behavioural characteristics of the children (N = 25) varied among the studies. Levels of evidence ranged from II to V (of a possible I-V). Study quality scores ranged from 2 to 5 (range: 0 to 7); mean = 3.9, mode = 5. Few studies in this area of PT practice have been published, and those identified scored low levels of rigour on the AACPDM criteria. Research suggests that exercise provides short-term reductions of stereotypic behaviours in children with ASD. Future research with stronger evidence levels, greater rigour, and longer-term outcome assessment is required to determine specific exercise parameters. ","821":"Shoulder pain is a major musculoskeletal and economic concern in industrialized countries, with the rate of surgical failure reportedly higher in patients injured at work. The purposes of this study were (1) to examine the prevalence of identifiable causes of rotator cuff surgery failure and (2) to examine the relationship among the existence of these causes and outcome scores, patient expectations, and overall satisfaction. This was a cross-sectional study of patients who experienced continued impairments following surgical treatment for work-related injuries. The primary outcome was a disease-specific measure, the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the existence of an identifiable reason for surgical failure vs. no reason for failure, as demonstrated by clinical and radiologic investigations and decided upon by a shoulder surgeon and a physical therapist. Analyses included a t-test for independent sample means, linear regression, non-parametric Wilcoxon test, and Fisher's exact test. Thirty-eight consecutive patients were included in the study, and 24 causes of surgical failure were identified in 19 patients (50%). Overall, patients with findings of failure were more disabled according to the total WORC index and had higher levels of symptoms, emotional difficulties, and limitations in sports and recreational activities. Expectations and satisfaction levels were not significantly different between groups. Our results indicate that 50% of patients who reported failed surgery had at least one reason to explain their ongoing symptoms, emotional difficulties, and functional limitations. ","822":"Physical therapists are expected to engage in self-assessment in order to ensure competent practice and to identify appropriate professional development activities. This paper reviews the current literature on the accuracy and role of self-assessment in physical therapy. Current literature indicating that self-assessment cannot be conducted with any degree of accuracy is discussed, and a proposed reformulation of the concept of self-assessment is presented. Practical strategies are offered for clinicians to improve the potential for obtaining reliable and valid information about their own clinical performance to guide the selection of appropriate professional development activities and to promote the provision of competent patient care. ","823":"The purposes of this study were to examine changes in the use of standardized outcome measures by practising physiotherapists in Ireland and to compare those trends to the results of a similar survey conducted previously in Canada. A survey methodology was employed. The review of practice occurred at two points in time. Senior clinical physiotherapists working with older people participated. Questions were asked about the use of standardized outcome measures, the nature and pattern of their use, and the level of confidence the respondents had in using such measures. The results chart the changes in practice over a 5-year period. Although there was an increase in the use of standardized outcome measures, the respondents acknowledged barriers to their systematic use in routine practice (e.g., lack of time, resources\/administrative support). There was a lack of professional consensus on what instruments to use in general, as well as which to use for particular client groups. Concern was expressed that none of the available instruments met their clients' needs. Where possible and appropriate, comparison was made between the data from the 2003 Irish study and a survey of Canadian physiotherapists conducted in 1998. This review of practice illustrates that changes that have occurred in Ireland in the use of standardized outcome measures are similar to those that have occurred in Canada, but barriers remain to their complete integration into clinical practice and clinical decision making. ","824":"","825":"","826":"To determine factors associated with Canadian physiotherapists' interest in undertaking continuing education in various cardiorespiratory content areas and their willingness to complete a portion of study within each of these content areas via computer-assisted learning (CAL). In a six-page mailed questionnaire, 1,426 potential participants were asked to indicate their interest in 11 cardiorespiratory content areas, their continuing-education preferences, and their access and willingness to do continuing education by CAL. Demographic data were also collected from respondents. Respondents included 285 physiotherapists from cardiorespiratory interest groups (CRGs) and 447 from the licensing bodies' sample (overall response rate = 56%). Physiotherapists in public employment and practice areas other than orthopaedics had increased interest in all cardiorespiratory content areas except Exercise Physiology. Membership in a CRG increased their likelihood to be willing to learn the cardiorespiratory content area via CAL. In developing content and determining the accessibility of cardiorespiratory continuing education, educators should consider the type of employer and area of practice of interested attendees as well as the lack of willingness to use CAL by those not involved in CRGs. ","827":"Despite the popularity of the Constant-Murley score (CMS), a combined patient-report and objective (health professional administered) shoulder outcome measure, minimal information exists on its reliability or validity. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) internal consistency and convergent validity of the CMS and (2) the degree to which other shoulder measures explain variation in range of motion and strength components of the CMS. In this cross-sectional study of outcome measures, 45 patients undergoing conservative or surgical treatment for rotator cuff disease participated. Two disease-specific outcome measures, one shoulder-specific measure, and one upper extremity outcome measure were compared to the CMS. Correlations between competing measures and relative total CMS were moderate (0.56 to 0.75). The American Shoulder &amp; Elbow Score, the Upper Extremity Functional Index, the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, and the Rotator Cuff Quality of Life index explained 38%, 28%, 26%, and 10% of variance of the objective component of the CMS respectively. The patient-report component of the CMS measures a multidimensional concept. The strength component had moderate correlations with isometric strength measures of the shoulder external rotators and abductors. The total CMS appears to measure a construct that is not totally captured by competing measures. The unexplained variance may be due, in part, to the lack of importance of the patient's physical impairment to symptoms or activity limitations as measured by other instruments. ","828":"","829":"Programme evaluation has been defined as \"the systematic process of collecting credible information for timely decision making about a particular program.\" Where possible, findings are used to develop, revise, and improve programmes. Theory-based programme development and evaluation provides a comprehensive approach to programme evaluation. In order to obtain meaningful information from evaluation activities, relevant programme components need to be understood. Theory-based programme development and evaluation starts with a comprehensive description of the programme. A useful tool to describe a programme is the Sidani and Braden Model of Program Theory, consisting of six programme components: problem definition, critical inputs, mediating factors, expected outcomes, extraneous factors, and implementation issues. Articulation of these key components may guide physiotherapy programme implementation and delivery and assist in the development of key evaluation questions and methodologies. Using this approach leads to a better understanding of client needs, programme processes, and programme outcomes and can help to identify barriers to and enablers of successful implementation. Two specific examples, representing public and private sectors, will illustrate the application of this approach to clinical practice. Theory-based programme development helps clinicians, administrators, and researchers develop an understanding of who benefits the most from which types of programmes and facilitates the implementation of processes to improve programmes. ","830":"To evaluate the effectiveness of muscle rehabilitation modalities, it is first necessary to develop a model to test measures that would assess physiological, sensory, and functional muscle recovery. This study attempted to develop such a model for wrist injury. Healthy male and female adults (n = 25). SUBJECTS performed wrist muscle damage assessment, soreness, discomfort, difficulty, and functional motor task tests before and 1, 2, and 7 days after eccentric wrist muscle contractions. Wrist-related motor task tests, including the perception of discomfort and difficulty during performance, were also conducted. At 24 hours post-eccentric exercises, wrist extension and flexion force declined (p &lt; 0.05) and soreness (p &lt; 0.05) and circumference (p &lt; 0.05) increased; all returned to normal by 7 days post-exercise. At 24 and 48 hours post-exercise, perception of discomfort and difficulty was elevated during performance of motor tasks (p &lt; 0.05). The completion speed of motor tasks was unaffected at any time post-eccentric exercise (p &gt; 0.05). Loss of wrist muscle force, increased soreness, task discomfort, and difficulty were noted following eccentric exercise. However, subjects appeared able to compensate, such that the speed of completion of motor tasks was not slowed. Longer or more specific motor tasks may be necessary to mimic real work performance decrement and recovery. ","831":"The purpose of this study was to capture the meaning of professional success to experienced physiotherapists practising in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Using a qualitative, phenomenological approach, 10 physiotherapists from the GTA each participated in a 60-minute, semistructured, face-to-face interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the vanKaam method, modified by Moustakas. Participants described success as \"moving forward,\" a dynamic and evolving experience that extends throughout an entire career. Study participants identified three markers of professional success: positive patient outcome, career advancement, and advancement of the physiotherapy profession. The experience of moving forward toward success applied to all of these markers and was driven by making choices. Choices made throughout a career were influenced by mentorship and self-reflection. The physiotherapists in this study described different indicators of success than have been described by other health care or corporate professionals in the literature. Success in the physiotherapy profession is experienced as a circular rather than linear process. Physiotherapists, professional organizations, and employers have a role in fostering professional success. We suggest the introduction of mentorship and self-reflection programmes early in one's career, focusing on the three markers of success: patient outcomes, career advancement, and advancement of the profession. ","832":"Following hip fracture, patients demonstrate greatly reduced walking speeds 1 year later compared with age-matched elders. The purpose of our study was to examine the factors that relate to gait speed in patients after hip fracture. Forty-two men and women (mean age 79 +\/- 7.5 years) who sustained a hip fracture participated in this study. Linear regression analysis was used to determine a statistical model that best predicted gait speed, the dependent variable. Gait speed was measured with a computerized gait mat. The independent variables were age, sex, height, weight, time post-fracture, medications, mental status, depression, balance confidence, Medical Outcome Studies, Short Form (SF-36), balance, and lower extremity isometric force. All subjects were discharged from physical therapy services, and measurements were taken, on average, 17 weeks post-fracture. Using stepwise regression, 72% of the variance in gait speed was explained by summed lower extremity strength normalized by body weight, general health (SF-36), and balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale). Impairments (summed lower extremity strength) and risk factors (perception of general health and balance confidence) are important predictors of gait speed in elders after hip fracture. ","833":"","834":"PURPOSE: This paper reviews the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate force in individuals with stroke and summarizes the effects of strength training in these individuals. In addition, a systematic review of studies that have incorporated progressive strengthening interventions in individuals with stroke is presented.  SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: Central (e.g., motor recruitment) and peripheral (e.g., muscle atrophy) sources may alter muscle strength in individuals with stroke and further investigations are needed to partition and quantify their effects. As to the effect of strength training interventions in individuals with stroke, the majority of studies (albeit with small samples) that evaluated muscle strength as an outcome demonstrated improvements. With regard to the effect of strength training on functional outcomes in individuals with stroke, positive outcomes were found in less rigorous pre-test\/post-test studies, but more conflicting results with controlled trials.  CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some suggestion that strength training alone can improve muscle strength, further research is required to optimize strength training and the transfer of these strength gains to functional tasks in individuals with stroke.","835":null,"836":"Validation of evaluation methods is necessary in order to appropriately monitor Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) patients and to determine the effectiveness of treatment and prevention programs. The goal of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of five evaluation methods: a functional index questionnaire (FIQ), visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain, a patellofemoral function scale (PFS), a step test and a subjective report of functional limitations. Measurements for each of the six components were taken on 56 PFPS patients participating in a randomized clinical trial, prior to and at one month following treatment. Modest test-retest reliability for the FIQ, VAS and step test were found. High internal consistency for the FIQ and modest internal consistency for the PFS were demonstrated. The VAS and FIQ were found to be good discriminators for measuring clinical change, while the step test was found to be reliable but poor at detecting clinical change. The PFS, which combines a number of evaluation areas into an index, demonstrated potential to detect clinical change, however, conclusions are limited as reliability testing was not performed.","837":"The Lower Extremity Activity Profile (LEAP) is a comprehensive measure of lower extremity function. It measures the client's perception of difficulty and satisfaction with performance in the following areas: self care, mobility, household activities, work, leisure activities, and social activities. The development and initial reliability and validity testing of LEAP was conducted with 32 osteoarthritis clients undergoing total knee replacement. Using a one-group repeated measures design, the LEAP, knee range of motion and self-paced walk measures were administered pre-operatively and 3 months post-operatively. The internal consistency of the LEAP using Cronbach's Alpha was 0.73. All LEAP scores showed significant improvement (p&lt;0.01) between the two administration times demonstrating responsiveness of the measure. Correlations of LEAP with the clinical measures were moderate. LEAP is recommended for use as an outcome measure in similar populations, if used in conjunction with clinical and physical performance measures. Further testing of the LEAP is warranted for use in evaluating outcomes of rehabilitation programs addressing lower extremity musculoskeletal impairment and disability.","838":"","839":"This pilot project was designed to collect information on the student assessment formats used by Canadian Physiotherapy programs. A mail questionnaire was used to gather the information. Practical exams generally consist of one to two cases with one examiner present. Little examiner training takes place. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination is being used at five universities. Stations are generally five to ten minutes long, with five to fifteen stations per exam. Patient and examiner training is sporadic. Multiple Choice Question Exams are used regularly with 40-150 questions being included. The respondents were generally satisfied with their clinical placement assessments. None of the respondents showed an understanding of standard setting. Various responses and methods of using the assessment procedures are not in accordance with research findings on the use of these methods. This may indicate a need for faculty development in the area of measurement and evaluation.","840":"This study examined whether providing information to rehabilitation professionals, on the compensation status of patients, would influence their rating of nonverbal expressions of pain. In an experimental design two groups of physiotherapists and occupational therapists were asked to view videotapes of 10 patients with shoulder pain undergoing a total of 88 pain induction tests. They were asked to rate the amount of pain the patients were experiencing based solely on the facial expression of pain. Bias was instilled in one group (n = 18) by informing them that the patients originated from a workers' compensation facility. Sixteen therapists served as a control group. Results indicate that the therapists rated the nonverbal expression of pain similarly regardless of their perceived compensation status. These findings suggest that the mistrust that is commonly experienced by patients on workers' compensation does not come from rehabilitation professionals but from other sources within the system. Alternative explanations for the findings and directions for future research are explored.","841":"","842":"It has been reported that over 80% of physiotherapists and physiotherapy students have experienced inappropriate patient sexual behaviour (IPSB). This paper reports the results of a qualitative analysis of written comments respondents made to four open-ended questions that were part of a survey on IPSB. Quantitative analyses of the responses to the remainder of the questions have been reported previously. The objectives of this study were to determine the content required for educational programs and to explore the strategies and suggestions respondents have made relevant to IPSB. A questionnaire was sent to 118 physiotherapists and 87 physiotherapy students. Completed questionnaires were returned by over 70% in each group. The questions asking for comments on how respondents have learned to deal with IPSB and what information about IPSB is important for in-service and undergraduate education were coded into themes to characterize the responses. Respondents described their experiences with IPSB, identified the knowledge areas that they consider to be important, emphasized the importance of prevention, getting and giving support, the specific ways that they have learned to cope, and the skills to handle IPSB. This emphasized the importance of a comprehensive educational strategy to respond to IPSB.","843":"The development of outcome measures of disability is an important focus in physical therapy research. This paper reviews the content of functional status\/disability measures developed between 1950 to 1989 to ascertain trends in disability measurement. Content analysis reveals that measures have followed three predominant patterns: a self care to a functional focus, a physical to a psychosocial focus, and a clinician to a client focus. These patterns related issues are discussed. The development of physical therapy measures requires the consideration of various perspectives, including the consumer perspective. Physical therapy measures must reflect a perspective which integrates physical capacity, physical function and environmental concerns.","844":"","845":"Electrotherapy is a common treatment intervention administered by physiotherapists. Owing to a lack of scientific reporting of modality usage, particularly within Canada, it was the purpose of this study to survey all private practitioners registered within the Province of Alberta. A total of 208 clinicians representing 41% of the population sample, responded to the survey. Results indicated hot packs followed by ultrasound, ice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential were the most frequently used modalities. With the exception of ultrasound, these findings differed considerably from previous reports of modality usage. Statistical comparisons, using Fisher's exact test of independence, revealed frequent use of TENS was greater amongst older clinicians and clinic owners (p &lt; 0.05) while male therapists used biofeedback more often than female colleagues (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found between therapists trained at the University of Alberta and those educated elsewhere. Peer influence within the geographically and politically defined sample population may explain the relatively few between-group differences. Future research should target additional population samples plus continue to monitor trends within previously studied groups.","846":"","847":"The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the productivity of physical therapy students during their clinical placements at the University of Alberta Hospitals and to assess the impact of supervision on professional staff time. Subjects were 29 professionals and 51 students. Data related to staff supervision time and to direct patient care time were obtained from the Workload Measurement System computer database. Average patient-related service time for staff while supervising a student was compared with average patient-related service time for the same staff while not supervising a student across nine service areas. Average hours per day of student direct care were compared with average hours per day of therapists' supervision time across the same nine service areas. Results indicated that average patient-related service time for staff supervising a student decreased significantly during periods of student supervision, and that physical therapy students' average amount of direct care was significantly greater than the average amount of therapists' supervision time. There was preliminary evidence of a positive net effect of clinical placements on service delivery.","848":"Managed Care (MC) is a multidisciplinary model for health care delivery that organizes and sequences the caregiving process. Its objectives include: 1) to reduce length of stay and resource consumption, and 2) to measure, maintain or improve patient outcomes related to care received. Our tertiary care facility is the first Canadian hospital to implement MC. Patient care is directed through the use of a Care Map. Each map is specific to a pathological state and its treatment, i.e. Total Knee Replacement (TKR), and consists of a Patient Problem List, with related patient-centred outcomes, and a Critical Path. The Critical Path outlines the temporal sequence of the provision of care. Most key events on a Care Map are determined anecdotally. The purpose of this project was to collect outcome information in patients assigned to the Total Knee Replacement Care Map in an attempt to validate the existing Care Map or make recommendations for revisions. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of knee range of motion-was calculated using the Intra Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). ICC values ranged from .64-.97. Seventeen patients were assessed. All patients were measured on Day 6 and 8 of the Care Map. This process has resulted in validation of certain range estimates and recommendations for revision of others.","849":"The purpose of this study was to provide a profile of patient perceptions of the service quality delivered by a back pain rehabilitation clinic. Data were gathered and analyzed at the clinic level in twelve different locations across Canada. Measurement techniques were based on validated survey methods and developed from a growing stream of social science research. Results provided clinic managers with a profile of perceived service quality in terms of three key aspects: administrative support, quality of therapy received, and satisfaction with the results. The results also provided each clinic with benchmarks so that on-going service quality measurements can be incorporated into a system of continuous quality improvement. This process can assist rehabilitation clinics (and other health care providers) in improving service as well as ultimately reducing the costs of providing treatments involving physiotherapy.","850":"","851":"","852":"","853":"","854":"A Falls and Balance Clinic for the elderly has been developed with the aim of identifying those at risk of subsequent falls, and recommending intervention strategies to reduce this risk. The physical and functional status of 149 clients referred to the Clinic are reported. Neurological and musculoskeletal pathologies were identified as the cause of falls in the majority of clients. Measures of gait velocity and stride length, and ability to stand on one leg were markedly reduced compared with normative data for healthy elderly. A number of other measures of balance, strength, and function are also reported. The results of a questionnaire about home environment indicated that only 28% of those referred had been assessed in their own home in the previous year. Home environment was considered a potential risk in a further 28% of clients and a home visit was instituted in these cases. Other intervention strategies included referral for further investigations (36%), Day Hospital (33%), provision of a home program of balance or strengthening exercises (27%), and medication change (15%). Issues related to the establishment, operation and long term evaluation of the effectiveness of a specialist Falls and Balance Clinic for the elderly are discussed.","855":"Postoperative length of stay (LOS) may be affected by more intensive physical therapy following surgery. This study was designed to assess whether LOS could be affected by weekend physical therapy following surgery in patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Weekend coverage for these patients was made possible by increased staffing in the Physical Therapy Department. The study group consisted of 84 patients who had undergone THA or TKA and had physical therapy treatment the weekend following surgery. The Control group consisted of 53 patients who had undergone THA or TKA prior to the implementation of the weekend intervention program. A retrospective chart audit was used to obtain pertinent information about control group patients. In the total sample mean LOS following weekend therapy (10.84 days) was significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) from mean LOS prior to implementation of the study (12.28 days). Significant decreases in postoperative LOS were also found within the two subgroups of patients who had undergone THA and TKA. The results indicate that physical therapy treatment the weekend following THA or TKA significantly decreases postoperative LOS when physical therapy resources are increased to accommodate this increase in coverage.","856":"Results of an initial study indicated that the most significant factor affecting retention for Physiotherapists in Northern Ontario was perceived opportunity for career development. A follow-up study was completed two years later to determine: 1) actual job turnover and regional attrition among physiotherapists in Northern Ontario; and 2) the predictive validity of variables identified in the first study regarding job turnover and regional attrition. Job turnover occurred in 29.5% of those sampled and the regional attrition rate was 12%. Discriminant function analysis revealed factors affecting job turnover and regional attrition including professional experience, practice location, opportunity for career development and size of community of residence. Based on previous intention, indicated by participants, follow-up revealed that the initial study correctly predicted 77.5% of those who changed their jobs and 74.1% of those who left Northern Ontario. Identified factors provide direction for the development of strategies for recruitment and retention of physiotherapists.","857":"","858":"","859":"","860":"The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is an examination format with particular emphasis on examining clinical skills. It has been developed for the last 10-15 years in the medical field and, during the past five years, there has been some development in the nursing profession. The use of OSCE in physiotherapy is just beginning. This paper is an overview of this examination format. A description of OSCE is followed by consideration of various aspects, including standardized patients, raters, the validity and reliability of the exam, and the educational impact. The OSCE is credible as a test of clinical competence, but reliability is perhaps lower than would be optimal for a licensure examination. Combining an OSCE with a multiple choice exam may have desirable effects on student learning and have acceptable reliability levels. A survey of the 13 Canadian schools of physiotherapy conducted to ascertain the current level of usage showed only two schools currently using the OSCE in their programs.","861":"","862":"This study was undertaken to test the clinical applicability of a novel device for measurement of stance balance performance. Samples were taken from hemiparetic patients (n = 27, age range 60-80) and of three groups of healthy subjects (24 subjects at ages 64-81, 13 at ages 27-50 and 24 aging 20-24 years). Stance was evaluated in six different positions incorporating two perturbing effects: visual deprivation and movements--linear and angular--of the base of support. Three variables were measured: sway and the values of the X and Y coordinates of the Center of Pressure. Concurrent validity of the system was assessed by comparing results with data of other works that tested comparable variables in similar populations and with already well established instrumentation. Repeatability of measurements was checked by performing all tests twice and comparing their results, as well as by calculating test retest reliability. The findings pointed to significant effects of vision and of movement of the base of support on sway, and to a significant difference between sway of hemiparetic patients and healthy subjects. The location of the COP in both the X and Y coordinates was not substantially influenced by the above effects. The agreement of the findings with existent knowledge indicates that the system is credible for measurement of body sway and of the location of the COP in various stance positions.","863":"The recent introduction of the Management Information System (MIS) guidelines has sparked much interest among health care institutions across Canada regarding proper approaches to the recording and interpretation of various financial and workload indicators. While the benefits of the MIS guidelines are widely acknowledged, much less attention has been directed to how departmental managers can analyze and make use of the vast amount of information generated. In this paper we attempt to review some of the computer-based decision-support tools that may be useful to the manager of the rehabilitation services department in analyzing the various MIS data that are collected. The data are assumed to be available through a computerized rehabilitation information system which includes workload measures. The quantitative models reviewed in this paper include basic descriptive statistics, deviation, trend and what-if-analysis and graph-plotting. Although the use of such tools can assist the rehabilitation manager in the routine decision-making process, it is very important that we ask the right questions and employ the proper model to make the most rational and best decision. In this respect, ongoing training in general problem-solving skills, decision-making processes, and use of computer-based decision-support tools may be very beneficial.","864":"This study investigated the accuracy and inter-rater reliability of 'specialized' physical therapists in the auscultation of tape-recorded lung sounds. In addition, a correlation was investigated between accuracy of interpretation and the number of years of specialization in the field of cardiorespiratory physical therapy. This research follows an earlier study which investigated the accuracy and inter-rater reliability of auscultating tape-recorded lung sounds in a 'non-specialized' cohort of physical therapists. The subjects were 26 'specialized' cardiorespiratory physical therapists working in acute urban teaching hospitals. These individuals were required to have been practising currently and exclusively for at least one year in the area of cardiorespiratory physical therapy. Participants listened with a stethoscope to five different sounds and identified them from a standardized list of terms. One of three tapes with the same lung sounds in different order was randomly selected for each physical therapist. The percentage of correct answers for all subjects was calculated. An accurate response in the detection of lung sounds was arbitrarily defined as a percentage of correct answers of 70% or greater. The difference between the pooled correct response rate of 50% and the arbitrarily set value of 70% was statistically significant (z = 2.23, p &lt; 0.05), indicating that the 'specialized' physical therapists were not accurate in identifying lung sounds. There was no relationship evident between the accuracy and the number of years of cardiorespiratory 'specialization' (r = 0.08). Analysis of inter-rater reliability revealed 'fair agreement' (kappa = 0.26) among subjects. These results were similar to those found in the previous study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","865":"The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine the intratester and intertester reliability of a functional mobility assessment tool (FMAT). Seven licensed physical therapists with varying amounts of clinical experience served as raters. Twelve patients with neurological deficits were subjects for this study. Raters were asked to provide eight possible ratings for each of eight critical mobility functions. Average weighted kappa coefficients ranged from .82 to .97. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .73 to .97 for the first assessment and from .52 to .97 for the second (retest) assessment. A high degree of agreement between and within seven raters indicated that this tool may provide an effective assessment of stroke, brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Preliminary findings indicate the functional mobility assessment tool is reliable, thereby increasing the usefulness of this method for clinical assessment. The high resolution of the FMAT makes this tool ideally suited for use in future studies focusing on the prediction of mobility function following neurological insult.","866":"","867":"This survey was funded and conducted by the Ontario and Canadian Physiotherapy Association Task Force on Professional Identity. Professional identity influences the image an occupation projects to its clients, the public, other occupations and governments. As an aid to planning strategy for advancing the professional image of physiotherapy, an open-ended questionnaire explored Canadian physiotherapists' professional identity. Professional identity is promoted by Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) branches and districts. Most therapists identified their skills and potential benefit for patients, but only 15% identified themselves as a member of a health profession involved in a rewarding career. Physiotherapists have achieved many characteristics of an independent profession, but expressed frustration reveals that some members lack power on a personal and professional level.","868":"When a large number of athletes compete intensely over a short period of time, a variety of sports injuries and illnesses are often encountered. Maintaining health records at these events presents a challenge to medical organizing committees. Accurate data collection is important, not only for planning of medical services, but also for development of prevention programs and policies relating to athletes' health. Recruitment of a dedicated data collection team with sports medicine background and computer expertise will facilitate collection and analysis of medical data at this type of event. This paper reviews the development and implementation of a sports injury and illness recording system used at the 1989 Jeux Canada Summer Games. Over 3500 participants had access to comprehensive medical services during the two weeks of competitions. Information on medical encounters was available daily during the games and a final report on sports injuries and illnesses was easily generated.","869":"This study investigated the effectiveness of videotaped versus written discharge summaries in communicating patient information to rural physiotherapists. Twenty-seven rural Manitoba physiotherapists were randomly divided into two groups and tested after viewing videotapes and reading written summaries on four patients with neurological conditions. Group I saw the videotapes on the four patients first, then answered multiple choice questions regarding the patients' problems, goals and treatment for physiotherapy. Group II read the written reports first, then answered the same questions. The process was then repeated in reverse order. A statistically significant difference existed between Group I's videotape scores and Group II's written summary scores (t = 4.69, 25 d.f., p = 0.002, 1-tailed unpaired t test). There was no significant difference between Group I and Group II's videotapes score. A rating scale of the videotapes by the physiotherapists strongly supported videotaped communication. This study has relevance to those who need to communicate patient information to health care workers in distant locales.","870":"","871":"","872":"Arthritis Society physiotherapists (PTs) in Ontario adopted Problem Oriented Records (POR) to monitor patient care; goals were to encourage patient specific treatment plans and standardized records. After nine months in practice, the POR system was evaluated by an audit on charts of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Audit teams of two PTs were created within each of five geographic areas. Auditors attended an audit instruction workshop. Two charts, selected randomly from the discharged patients of each of 38 therapists, were independently scored on 56 items by an audit team. The extent of agreement within the auditor team (observer variation) was measured, and adequacy scores computed for each chart. Adequate reliability of the audit instrument was established before examination of adequacy scores and making inferences about quality of care. The auditor agreement measures (kappa) varied from 0.13 to 0.97, mean = 0.74 and SD = 0.16; these estimates were indicative of adequate reliability of the audit form, although agreement scores were different amongst the five areas (P2 less than .01). POR adequacy scores varied from 10.0 to 93.1, mean = 64.5 and SD = 16.9. There were no differences in adequacy scores amongst the five areas (P2 = .61). To reduce observer variation, increased pre-audit emphasis is needed on auditor guidelines and training for items relating to assessment findings, problem identification, and treatment planning.","873":"This study examined demographic differences between practising and non-practising physiotherapists, reasons for leaving the profession and factors that might influence return. A mailed survey was sent to three groups of Ontario physiotherapists: 1) those who had not renewed registration to practice (Cancelled); 2) those who were registered but not practising (Inactive); and 3) a group of actively practising therapists randomly selected (Control). The overall response rate was 76%. Significant differences among the three groups were in personal income and membership in the professional association (CPA). The majority of those not practising were not working outside the home and approximately half planned to return. The two most important reasons for not working in physiotherapy were: a) raising a family; and b) the desire for new challenges and further education. The most important factors that would influence return were: a) opportunity for flexible hours for those planning to return; and b) upgrading of the profession for those not planning to return. Family related and professional\/job issues for those not working in physiotherapy and differences between practising and non-practising groups are discussed. Strategies for retention and return are recommended.","874":"","875":"This article focuses on some of the problems presented by alcohol and drug dependent patients and how physiotherapists can respond to them. Approaches used on the Medical Ward of the Clinical Institute of the Addiction Research Foundation (ARF) are presented. The attitude of the physiotherapist toward addictions is important, both in the rehabilitation of the patient's physical problem and in the treatment of his\/her alcohol or drug problem. Questions about drug or alcohol use in a physiotherapy assessment can reveal important information about how the patient manages pain and add to understanding of other psycho-social considerations. A brief overview of the types of patient conditions commonly seen on the Medical Ward is given. This is followed by an outline of the ways in which withdrawal from drugs and alcohol is managed. Information is included about pathology related to alcohol abuse. Evidence that many alcohol-related neurological conditions are often reversible suggests that physiotherapists should be optimistic in their expectations about successful alcohol and drug treatment outcomes and should convey this optimism to their patients.","876":"A job-sharing arrangement for the Assistant Directors of Physiotherapy at the Royal Jubilee Hospital proved to be an innovative and successful experience demonstrating the feasibility of job-sharing at administrative levels in rehabilitation. Physiotherapy is traditionally a female dominated profession. By the time therapists are most highly skilled and clinically experienced, they have arrived at prime marriage and child-bearing years. Many valuable members are lost to the profession each year as therapists leave the work force to take care of their families, continue their education and participate in recreational activities. Alternative employment opportunities are needed to retain and return therapists to the work force. Convenience of work time is often important. Financial expectations may become a secondary consideration. A search of the literature revealed that while job-sharing has much to recommend it, it is not yet generally accepted in most health professional situations. A few anecdotal references described job-sharing in nursing. An industry-wide literature search revealed few references to the application of job-sharing at administrative levels.","877":"This article describes a system of Scheduled Days Off (SDO) that was implemented on a trial basis for one year by the Physiotherapy Section of Foothills Provincial General Hospital in Calgary, Alberta. Development of the SDO system was an attempt by the Physiotherapy Section to improve the quality of working life without a negative impact on productivity or quality of care. Each full-time physiotherapist extended work hours by 15 minutes per day and received an SDO following 30 working days. A productivity analysis of weighted units per paid hour and patient attendances per paid hour demonstrated an increase in productivity following implementation of the system. Work time used for personal appointments, sick time and staff satisfaction were evaluated and showed positive changes during the trial period.","878":"Physical therapists are frequently called upon to aid in the physical rehabilitation of cancer patients. They also share responsibility for the psychosocial aspects of care with other members of the treatment team. The objective of this paper is to provide guidelines to assist physical therapists in providing psychosocial support to cancer patients referred for therapy around the time of diagnosis or during the initial treatment period. Normal and pathological responses of patients faced with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, including shock, fear, anger, anxiety and depression, are noted. Special attention is given to the importance of common defense mechanisms--denial, regression, rationalization and projection--and the difficulties faced by caregivers in dealing with these defenses. Principles of psychosocial intervention appropriate for use by physical therapists are presented. Two general types are suggested: the first concerns the patient's responses and feelings about the disease and the second involves educating the patient about how to most effectively deal with the disease. Physical therapists have an obligation to provide more than physical restorative services for cancer patients; they should be able to offer psychosocial support in an effort to enhance successful rehabilitation and reintegration to normal living patterns.","879":"Prison inmates, like the population at large, are entitled to physiotherapy care. However, the lack of information in the literature suggests physiotherapy in prisons is not commonplace. Where it does occur, the physiotherapist is often confronted by unfamiliar and unpleasant circumstances as there are significant differences between community or hospital based practices and a prison practice. The purpose of this communication is to describe, from the author's perspective, the various factors that make a prison practice difficult. Problems relating to jail security and attitudes are discussed. Health and behavioural problems unique to prison inmates are explored and methods of dealing with them examined. The physiotherapist's role in prison health care is addressed and, finally, some ideas for increasing the profile of physiotherapy in prisons are presented.","880":"","881":"","882":"The purposes of this study were to establish baseline information about the extent of physiotherapy (PT) retention problems in Northern Ontario, and to identify potentially significant factors for retention. Potential correlates of retention were grouped into four domains: personal, professional experience, occupational and environmental factors. The questionnaire was sent to all PTs registered to practise in Northern Ontario; a response rate of 82 per cent was achieved. Multiple regression techniques were used to identify significant variables (p. less than 05) directly associated with intention to leave Northern Ontario. Path analysis was also completed to identify factors with indirect relationships to the outcome measure. The most significant factor was the perceived opportunity for career development, results have implications for health care administrators and planners in their development of strategic plans to increase employee retention.","883":"Goal-setting is traditionally used by physical therapists; however, factors identified in the literature as increasing goal achievement are often not considered. The purpose of this paper is to describe the potential use of goal-setting in improving and measuring effectiveness in physical therapy practice. Factors identified in the literature for effective goal-setting include setting specific and measurable goals, degree of goal difficulty, goal acceptance, and feedback. Active participation by the client in the goal-setting process is of primary importance. In order to maximize the use of goal-setting in physical therapy practice, reliable, valid, and sensitive clinical measures need to be identified and developed. There appears to be a potential for further use of goal-setting in physical therapy practice both as a means of improving treatment effectiveness and as a method for measuring effectiveness of treatment programs.","884":"Previous research has demonstrated that practitioners within the same profession share a common approach to knowledge acquisition and transmission. A search for the identification of this common approach to knowledge in physiotherapy was undertaken using the Epistemic Orientation Model. The research reported was premised on the assumption that students admitted to physiotherapy programs in Canada possess an epistemic orientation that is similar to the epistemological structure of the knowledge base considered important to the program. Using a standardized instrument known as the Knowledge Accessing Modes Inventory (KAMI) to measure epistemic orientation, data were collected from a sample (N = 59) of first- and third-year students registered in a physiotherapy program in a central Canadian university. The data indicated that a high degree of association exists between the epistemological structure subsumed in the knowledge base deemed essential to gain admission to the program and the dominant rational epistemic mode of the practitioners-to-be. Based on the results, the article examines the usefulness of the epistemic orientation concept on activities within the profession. Implications for professional development are noted and avenues for further research are suggested.","885":"","886":"This study was designed to gather information and opinion on the impact and role of auxiliary personnel in physiotherapy, in Nova Scotia (NS). The physiotherapist\/auxiliary ratio and present and future levels of education, supervision, and activities of auxiliary personnel were investigated. All NS physiotherapists registered with the Nova Scotia College of Physiotherapists (NSCP) were surveyed by mailed questionnaire; one follow-up was sent. Two questionnaires were developed. Potential levels of the terms assistant and technician were defined to facilitate interpretation of the opinion statements. Questionnaire A was mailed to all registered physiotherapists (n = 279, response rate 83%). Questionnaire B was mailed with Questionnaire A to directors and clinic owners (n = 73, 79% response rate). Results showed a physiotherapist\/auxiliary personnel ratio (excluding clerical) of 3.75:1. The majority of personnel were trained in-house. There was a trend toward less frequent supervision with more extensively trained auxiliary personnel. More respondents considered that formally trained assistants would best serve the profession of physiotherapy in the future. To conclude, this study adds to the body of knowledge of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association and the NSCP. It should assist the NS Department of Health and Fitness in analyzing needs for training of auxiliary personnel in Physiotherapy, and provide data for future studies.","887":"The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence enrollment in Dalhousie University's BSc (PT) degree-completion program. A geographically stratified, random sample of 100 nondegree physiotherapists practising in Atlantic Canada was surveyed by mail. The questionnaire solicited information on demographic data, program awareness and attitudes towards degree-completion programs. The response rate was 63 percent. More than 65 percent of respondents were trained in Canada, were older than 30 years, and had at least one child. Ninety percent of respondents were aware of the Dalhousie program; seven were currently enrolled. Ninety-three percent of respondents were confident they could continue to practise without a degree and 70 percent were confident they could meet academic standards required to complete a degree. Respondents were least certain on whether employers valued experience over a degree. Family responsibilities, age over 50, and job security were deterrents to enrollment. Nondegree physiotherapists in Atlantic Canada may not choose to upgrade to a degree because of the regional manpower shortage and job security. A strong pool of degree-completion students was not identified.","888":"Risk Management is an important focus in health care today. We attempt to define the term and explore differences between a risk management approach and quality assurance. Occurrence screening is examined and the importance of patient satisfaction outlined. An example of a practical physiotherapy program which incorporates quality assurance, risk management, and utilization review is given.","889":"The Canadian physiotherapy profession developed from a small group of British nurse-masseuses, the Incorporated Society of Trained Maseuses (ISTM). In the early 20th century, ISTM-certified massage practitioners and remedial gymnasts began to organize to form a society that would strive for professional recognition and protection in Canada. The fledgling physiotherapy profession sought and received assistance from the medical profession. In return, physiotherapists accepted medical supervision. The two world wars provided impetus to the development of physiotherapy, in achieving both professional status and expansion of demand for physiotherapy services. By the 1960s, demand had produced nine new university physiotherapy programs in Canada. More physiotherapists were graduating in Canada than were arriving from other countries. Physiotherapists tolerated medical dominance during the 1950s and '60s, but grew increasingly restive while they developed their own professional competence, body of knowledge and political awareness. By the 1980s, most physiotherapists sought a collegial relationship with medicine. They no longer felt the need for medical sponsorship. The profession was involved in active struggle to achieve legislative recognition of its standards, modes of practice and claim for authority as a self-regulating profession, and in resistance to dominance by any other profession. This article places the development of physiotherapy in the historical, class, and gender context of Canadian society.","890":"A joint appointment is a position agreed to by a health service facility and an educational institution where the appointee holds a position in each affiliated institution and carries out defined responsibilities in each. In light of the growing costs of higher education, financial cut backs, the need to respond to manpower shortages and the expanding need for clinical research, the benefits of joint university-clinical appointments should be considered by academic and clinical institutions in physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT). To obtain data on existing joint university-clinical positions in Canadian PT and OT schools, mailed survey questionnaires were conducted. The purpose of the survey was to gain information on these appointments so that future faculty-clinical roles in PT and OT could be developed. An initial questionnaire was mailed to the 25 directors of the Canadian PT and OT education programs to obtain information on existing joint appointments and the names of joint appointees holding these positions. A second questionnaire was sent to 104 joint appointees to gather information on their perceptions of these positions. The results of this survey suggest that with continuing manpower shortages, demand for clinical research, increase in student enrollment and insufficient number of faculty members, there is a need to develop these roles further.","891":"The Northern Outreach Program (NOP) in Ontario, Canada was initiated in 1980 by the Health Sciences Faculties at The University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Ministry of Health. Objectives of the NOP are to contribute to development of health services and health manpower in Northern Ontario and to develop supportive research programs. NOP Coordinators are appointed to their respective faculties from each of the following disciplines: Communicative Disorders, Library Science, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Physical Therapy (PT). PT coordinators identify needs and opportunities for development of PT service and manpower in the North, collaborating with District Health Councils and health professionals. Programs are developed considering the areas of service, manpower, education, and research. Programs include workshops, consultations, student clinical placements, and access to library resources. An external evaluation of the NOP was carried out and ongoing evaluation of the PT program is based on feedback from program participants. The NOP has been effective in supporting development of PT services in Northern Ontario, decreasing professional isolation and also serves as a model for other programs. Alternatives for recruitment and retention of manpower and research opportunities must continue to be developed to ensure optimal delivery of health care to underserviced areas.","892":"The purpose of this article is to outline the concept and development of the Amputee Visitor Program. This program is intended to provide information and emotional support to new amputees. The importance of selecting suitable candidates and the educational package provided is felt to be most critical. The concept of the Amputee Visitor Program could easily be adapted to other disabilities with the goal of improving quality of life and enhancing the rehabilitation program.","893":"A knowledge of ethics and communication skills is essential to professional practice, just as it is essential to treatment techniques in the clinical application of physical therapy. Ethics has personal, professional and legal implications which, if neglected, may result in adverse consequences for both the clinician and the patient. The purpose of this paper is to outline four practical ethical doctrines and their import on clinical practice. The emphasis is on communication. Improvement in technical, clinical and research expertise is a continuing objective in the development of Canadian physical therapy. The maintenance of a parallel focus on human needs and values, along with ethics and interpersonal communication skills, serves to enhance the image of physical therapy as an holistic and caring profession.","894":"The aim of this study is to establish at what time intervals regular checks of therapeutic ultrasound devices (TUSD) should be made to verify power output, timer accuracy, and ultrasonic frequency. Twenty-nine TUSDs from physiotherapy departments of 11 hospitals affiliated with the University of Montreal were retained for the study. The make, model, date of purchase, and other pertinent data of the TUSDs were determined from a questionnaire completed by each participating hospital. Power output, timer accuracy, and ultrasonic frequency of the TUSDs were verified every 4 weeks during a 20-week period with 2 further verification visits at 12-week intervals to complete the study. Data collected included the duration, intensity, and frequency of use of the TUSDs. The humidity and ambient temperature of the treatment locales were also recorded. At the initial verification, 66 percent of the TUSDs were found to be outside of tolerance limits for ultrasound intensity and 35 percent had inaccurate timers. For the duration of the study (44 weeks), 62 percent (18) of the TUSDs had to be calibrated at least twice, 38 percent (11) three times, and 31 percent (9) needed to be calibrated at least four times. Statistical analysis of the data failed to identify which factor or factors caused the deterioration in calibration of these TUSDs. Among the suggestions for improving the accuracy and safety of ultrasound treatments is that calibration verification should be made every 4 weeks and at even shorter intervals for some units. The authors suggest a follow-up study to determine the results of weekly verification.","895":"Although many academic institutions have attempted to incorporate formal instruction in library skills into their curricula, the question as to the best method of conveying the necessary information has been a continual challenge to health care educators. A library skills workshop, which included the distribution of a workbook, was offered to physical therapy and occupational therapy students in a Bachelor of Health Science program with the aim of assisting students to develop skills in library searches and to perform critical appraisals of the literature. Thirty-three students agreed to participate in a study designed to determine its effectiveness: 24 who had volunteered to attend the workshop formed the experimental group, and 9 who did not attend acted as controls. A Library Skills Questionnaire that attempted to measure cognitive and psychomotor skills in retrieving and appraising health care literature was given to all participants prior to, and at the completion of, the two-session workshop. Nine students in the experimental group did not attend the second session and were then termed \"drop-outs\" for the purpose of the study. The results show that the drop-outs had statistically significant higher knowledge scores (p = less than 0.05) in their post-test scores in comparison with both the students who attended the two sessions and the students in the control group. One explanation for this finding is that the drop-outs may be better self-directed learners who used the workbook to teach themselves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","896":"Ten years ago, Kahnawake (Quebec), an Indian reserve of 5300 persons just south of the island of Montreal, had no rehabilitation services. Anyone needing such services had to travel into Montreal. Today, there is new $4.2 million, 43-bed hospital with well-equipped physical and occupational therapy rooms and a number of associated community-based rehabilitation programs. The development of medical and rehabilitation services in this small Indian community was brought about by a number of factors: the farsightedness of several individuals in the medical community, the hard work of the rehabilitation team members and, above all, the significant attitudinal changes in the community itself.","897":"This paper describes and discusses theories, clinical models and research from the vantage point of their various components and interrelationships. A process model is proposed as a tool for the analysis needed not only to interpret the physiotherapy literature but to clarify the relationship of practice to relevant theories and research findings. The authors make the point that any change in any aspect of these three areas will have an effect on the other two. Two neurological examples are given to illustrate this point. The authors also argue that effective practice in the physiotherapeutic field depends upon the dynamic interaction among these three areas: theories, clinical models and research.","898":"In 1974, following an extensive eight-year review of professional practices in the Province of Quebec, the Professional Code and the 21 professional bills associated with it became operational. Thirty-eight professional corporations encompassing the fields of health, administration, finance, applied sciences and justice were named in the Code, and each was assigned an exclusive mandate to protect the public. The mechanisms outline for controlling professional practice and promoting public service included professional inspection and discipline, as well as regulations regarding ethics, the arbitration of accounts, the keeping of client records, and publicity. This paper discusses the effectiveness of these mechanisms over the past 10-year period. It also looks at the capabilities of the corporations to achieve their mandates in light of the legal status assigned to each--whether that be exclusive right of practice and reserve of title (21 corporations), or reserve of title only (17 corporations).","899":"Because of a perceived need for specialization within the profession, the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) accepted the concept of specialization for physiotherapists, during its Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June 1985. A proposal concerning the implementation of specialization (termed the \"Specialization Document\"), will be presented to the 1986 AGM for approval by the Association's voting delegates. This paper provides a brief outline of the document's contents, including: the structure of the proposed Canadian College of Physiotherapy, which will oversee the certification process; the role of the CPA Divisions in establishing specialty councils; and the mechanism whereby certification will be granted, touching on such factors as eligibility for certification, evaluation of competence, recertification, and cost. The specialization document makes provision, in the initial stages of specialization, for an Implementation Committee, whose task will be to define the criteria necessary for the establishment of the College's standards for specialization and certification. Specialization does not mean that all therapists must become certified specialists; certification will neither prohibit nonspecialists from practising in a specified area nor relegate certified specialists to practising only in special areas in which they are certified. The CPA Board of Directors supports certification because it is designed to promote the highest quality of health care by physiotherapists, while promoting the growth of physiotherapy theory and practice through a critical evaluation of current and potential treatment methodology. Because of the many steps necessary for a careful and logical development of the specialization methodology, it is expected that final approval of the certification process will require many years to achieve.","900":"Physiotherapy caseload standards were developed in 1975 for the purpose of providing an efficient statistical tool for department heads, administrators and government planners in their consideration of staffing and equipping treatment facilities. This paper is a summary of a report prepared by a committee of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association whose task was to evaluate the standards. Analysis of data collected by Statistics Canada via the Canadian Schedule of Unit Values in 1980-81, showed a high correlation between two primary workload indicators--attendances per department paid hour and attendances per physiotherapist paid hours. Using three of the seventeen statistical indicators developed, the committee prepared physiotherapy caseload standards for seven types of hospitals, categorized by size and the proportion of rehabilitation services they offered. The standards were later revised and reissued as guidelines. This report discusses three of the recommended guidelines: number of attendances per physiotherapy department paid hour; number of attendances per physiotherapist paid hour; and weighted units per physiotherapy department paid hour. A copy of the complete report is available from the Canadian Physiotherapy Association.","901":"This study was conducted to establish the reliablity and validity of an instrument designed to evaluate the clinical competence of physical therapy (PT) students. A criterion-referenced evaluation instrument--the Evaluation of Clinical Competence (ECC)--was developed by the investigator according to the procedures recommended in the measurement literature. This behaviourally-anchored, four-point rating scale was tested on two groups of PT students from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. In order to obtain data by which to analyze and revise the ECC, the ECC was administered to fourth-year PT students (n = 29) during their clinical placement in November 1982, according to specified instructions. The revised ECC was administered to third-year (n = 23) and fourth-year PT students (n = 25) during their clinical placements in February and March of 1983. The same instructions were followed in order to collect the necessary data to establish inter-rater reliability, concurrent validity, and construct validity of the ECC. The results of the study suggest that the ECC is a fairly reliable, valid, and practical instrument with which to assess the clinical competence of PT students.","902":"The study of clinical competence in physical therapy (PT) to date has focused primarily on a definition of the knowledge, skills, judgements, and attitudes that must be acquired by PT students for a satisfactory performance on entry into professional practice. Concomitant with this emphasis on defining clinical competence is the need for an accurate evaluation of the students' clinical competence during clinical practice. This study was designed to develop a tool for the evaluation of the clinical competence of PT students and to contribute to the definition of a construct of clinical competence. Three steps were involved in developing the evaluation tool. First, the clinical competencies required for PT practice were identified from a survey of the PT literature and professional documents. The identified clinical competencies were then validated through the analysis of a questionnaire completed by 121 physical therapists working in Edmonton, Alberta. The questionnaire results also provided a basis for determining the standards of performance by which to assess these competencies. Subsequently, an Evaluation of Clinical Competence (ECC) was designed as a behaviourally-anchored rating scale to determine, according to four standards of performance, whether a PT student could adequately perform the clinical competencies necessary to practise the profession.","903":"","904":"This paper outlines the rationale for the development of an information system and shows how much a system can become an effective management tool for physiotherapy department directors. The author points out the need to assess both costs and benefits before venturing into the world of computerized information systems, but also makes a case for the need to establish a useful system for the gathering and processing of data that will provide useful information, whether or not computers are used to store and analyze the data. A five-step approach to the development of an information system is presented. The steps include: system analysis, selection of design approach, systems design, implementation, and system maintenance. The author states that management information systems for the future--if they are to be efficient and effective---will require department heads to develop specific methodologies of approach.","905":"This paper reports the approach used in a physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) manpower requirements study conducted in British Columbia, Canada. A total of 426 questionnaires were mailed to likely employers of PTs and OTs, and to PTs in private practice. After telephone reminders and a second mailing, the overall response rate was 83.3%. The results of the survey indicated that, by 1986, respective PT and OT department heads were anticipating a 60% increase in demand for PTs and a 102% increase for OTs, while agency administrators were suggesting a 76% increase for PTs and a 142% increase for OTs. Although a variety of factors--all largely beyond the control of both respondents and researchers--will determine the degree to which these estimates actually reflect the future demand for these manpower groups, it should be noted that, for both disciplines, the anticipated increase was substantially greater than the level experienced in the five years preceding the survey. The estimation approach used in this study considers nonrespondents; it is a procedure which permits investigators to offer a more accurate picture of the current manpower situation while using a more realistic base on which to estimate future requirements. The development of the requirement side in the supply\/requirement equations of manpower studies may be well served in the future with this approach.","906":"Assessing quality of care is a topical subject in physiotherapy. This paper traces the involvement of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association in quality assessment, and describes the components of the quality assessment process in relation to professionally defined standards. It considers available information as to whether process studies, outcome studies, or a combination of these should be undertaken in determining the quality of care. Finally it proposes the use of a comprehensive program evaluation to assess the quality of care in a physiotherapy program for stroke patients. Four steps in the use of this model are outlined: assessment of needs; formulation of program goals; definition of program and design of evaluation; and assessment of process and outcome. The use of this model is advocated for it provides information on how and why a program does or does not make its desired impact.","907":"A biofeedback training device providing auditory and visual feedback regarding head position in space was used to teach the head control necessary for the operation of a head-driven electric wheelchair. A case study of an adolescent with severe athetoid cerebral palsy is presented. The training program consists of four short-term goals: to provide trunk stability; to promote limb and postural control; to teach static head control; and to teach dynamic head control. The authors found that the biofeedback training device was a useful tool for teaching the head control required to operate a head-driven electric wheelchair. Among the recommendations discussed in the conclusion of this paper is the suggestion that certain pieces of equipment, such as a time-event counter and videotape equipment, would be very useful tools for collecting objective information about the patient's progress.","908":"A preliminary investigation was initiated to explore the use of music as a means of improving general mobility, social interaction, and emotional stability in patients who have suffered a stroke. A literature search had revealed very little information on the use of music in the rehabilitation of such patients. The investigators videotaped a series of sessions involving group movement-to-music, group music-making, and individual movement-to-music. An individual case study in music-making was carried out as well. All videotapes were reviewed and we observed that an increase in the range and ease of movement of the patients occurred during weight-shifting activities, when appropriate music with a tempo of 58 to 63 beats per minute was used. Our observations supported the findings of recent research concerning preferred tempi for certain activities and reinforcement of movement by appropriate tempi. Other factors in our study, such as size of group, placement, cueing, and the opportunity to touch, appeared to affect the responses obtained in group situations. As the result of our observations, we have concluded that music enhances the general mobility and social interaction of patients who have sustained a cerebrovascular accident and that it may also improve a patient's emotional stability.","909":null,"910":"This study was designed to re-evaluate a comprehensive list of competencies for professional physical therapy practice that was developed, edited and field-tested three years ago. At that time, a representative population of physical therapy clinicians practising in the province of Quebec had rated 224 competence statements as to the respective levels of importance within their own professional practice. A smaller sample of these same physical therapists was again surveyed, three years later, for their reaction to the list in relation to clinical practice today. Of this group, 23 were still staff therapists and two had become administrators. The response rates indicate changes in treatment patterns with regard to cardiorespiratory conditions, electrotherapy, and prevention and maintenance programs. The changes in response rates, noted in the category of administration, can be attributed to the change in position of the two physical therapists who had become administrators. As shown in the previous study, there is still little evidence of research-related activities being carried out in the clinical field. This re-evaluation was undertaken in order to ascertain if there were changes in clinical practice occurring over time and whether or not these changes could be related to a change of position.","911":"Although the majority of health professionals believe in the value of team care, definitive evidence to support many of the claims made by proponents of this system is scarce. Numerous studies have suggested that selected categories of stroke patients do benefit from a coordinated interdisciplinary team approach, but few of these studies employed a true experimental design. Although additional research is necessary to ascertain accurately the benefits derived by stroke patients from the team approach and to determine how these benefits can be obtained most effectively and efficiently, there are many descriptive reports available that have useful directives for the organization and administration of a team approach to stroke care. This review documents the articles in which the philosophy and components of team care for stroke patients are described. Previous research endeavors designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the team approach to stroke care are summarized and the limitations of these studies are systematically noted. An emphasis is placed on acute and subacute care programs. Suggestions for future research endeavours, in terms of their methodological approach, are made.","912":"","913":"A malpractice action--one aspect of the application of legal principles known as the law of torts--is a means whereby an injured party may seek compensation for harm caused by another party. The primary function of the law of torts is to determine whether the injurer is under a legal obligation to provide compensation to the injured for some loss due to negligent or faulty conduct. A malpractice action against a physiotherapist involves a plaintiff patient who has been injured, a defendant physiotherapist who stands accused of having caused an injury, and a determination as to whether or not the physiotherapist should bear the loss. In order to establish the liability in negligence, a plaintiff must satisfy four requirements: duty of care, breach of standard of care, causation, and damage. In this paper, a case study of malpractice action against a physiotherapist is outlined as an example of the type of arguments used by both the plaintiff and the defendant. Malpractice actions are an important means of controlling the standards of all health professionals. Because increasingly complicated technology and increased pressures on health care professionals are unlikely to reduce the number of accidents, the malpractice action will continue to provide recourse for those patients injured by lapses from the requisite standards of a profession. The threat of a malpractice action alone, however, is not enough to ensure high professional and ethical standards.","914":"","915":"The traditional term professionalism--variously linked to such characteristics as an \"organized body of knowledge\", or a \"closely-knit association of people with a high degree of communication\"--has been described recently as a static concept. It is professionalization--the dynamic process of refinement through which the character and spirit of a profession is made real and operative--which is more relevant. Part of that process is quite obviously the application of new knowledge which today is growing at an increasing rate. Note this paradox: that although each profession grows by accentuating its own distinctive knowledge, that very specialization leads in turn to the need for closer relationships with allied professions. Equally important is each profession's need to continue to redefine its relationship with its clients. Continuing education is an essential tool in both of these tasks. Recent studies elicited a variety of reasons for the professional's interest and engagement in continuing education: to become better informed; to gain personal enrichment; to achieve career advancement; to satisfy individual curiosity; to fulfill an employer's requirements; to qualify for licensure; to meet new people; or to break out of a routine. Typically, continuing education is promoted by professional schools, university extension divisions, employing agencies, the professional association itself--and even its commercial suppliers. Physiotherapists ought reasonably to ask themselves these questions: What goals are to be sought in the ensuing five years? Which of these can be met through continuing education? What barriers to continuing education now exist? What methodology and delivery of continuing education will best serve the profession? How can this educational thrust be harnessed to improve physiotherapists' relationships with other professionals--and the general public?","916":"","917":"Various physiotherapy techniques have long been advocated as therapeutic tools for patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD). The purpose of this review is to present an outline of the different techniques, a definition of the present controversies, and an illustration of the possible new directions for physiotherapy in the future. The following aspects of the disease are reviewed: pathophysiology; research; patient education; secretion removal (including techniques of coughing, postural drainage, and percussion); breathing control exercises (including use of the abdominal muscles, nasal inspiration, pursed lip breathing, positioning, alteration of regional ventilation, and the related short and long-term benefits); and thoracic mobility exercises. The authors conclude not only that the physical therapeutic techniques used with COAD patients are extremely diverse in nature, but that the investigations of their validity have been neither comprehensive nor conclusive. Immediate study is needed to define more specific physiological aims for each modality; more selective and effective treatment can then be performed and the true potential of chest physiotherapy realized.","918":"","919":"Bobath's hypothesis--that the reflex-inhibiting patterns (RIP)s of a hemiplegic patient's non-exercising limb will prevent an abnormal increase in the muscle tone while the ipsilateral limb is being exercised--is examined in this study with the aid of an EMG biofeedback unit. Recordings were taken of the biceps brachii muscle of 15 patients during performance of lower extremity exercise, and from the medial gastrocnemius muscle of 12 patients during performance of an upper extremity exercise. Each muscle was examined six times in the same session: three of these repetitions being conducted in a RIP, the other three in a neutral position. The highest EMG values recorded in each of the two test situations were compared. The results did not point to a definite relationship between the RIPs and the electrical activity of the test muscles. Bobath's claim that there exists a consistent trend relating RIPs to reduction of muscle tone is therefore placed in doubt. Further research using objective techniques is required as a means of exploring this issue.","920":null,"921":"Work sampling is a tool used to examine the activities involved in performing a job. A work sampling study was designed to examine the components of physiotherapy care in a 350-bed teaching hospital. The components were related to a physiotherapist's activities and included an examination of the time related to patient treatment, attendance at meetings, record-keeping and preparation, travel, teaching, continuing education (in-service), talking to colleagues (doctors, occupational therapists), and other activities. The purpose of the study was to quantify a therapist's nontreatment activities, and to compare observations concerning treatment with the work sampling data obtained in compliance with the Canadian Schedule of Unit Values and, in particular, its weighted units. The study showed that there was no difference between the \"observed\" time (sampling time in percentage of total time) spent in direct patient contact, and the weighted units, when the latter was converted to a percentage of time. The Nova Scotia government's standard of 50 000 work units per year was found to be useful in justifying staffing levels; a useful indicator of productivity was also developed using weighted units expressed as a percentage of worked or paid hours. Work sampling would thus appear to be a useful tool for physiotherapy department managers.","922":"This study was designed to assess the professional satisfaction of a national sample of physiotherapists, all members of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA). A questionnaire was sent to 984 CPA members; 82.1% responded. Rather than analyzing the satisfaction items separately, the investigators used factor analysis to search for underlying structures in the responses. The principal component analysis indicated that there were four discrete patterns of covariation in the responses, and the resulting factors were labelled \"professional interests,\" \"patient care\", \"supervision\" and \"work conditions\", in accordance with the content of the items grouped into each factor. The combination of these cores plus the results of a global ranking of the profession indicated a consistently high level of overall satisfaction on the part of the CPA therapists. As for characteristics and career patterns, the female CPA members appeared to move in an out of professional practice while the male members pursued careers. The reasons for the low level of professional satisfaction on the part of an albeit small minority of physiotherapists were found to be associated with dissatisfaction with working conditions. Further research is required to relate physiotherapists' satisfaction with their profession to their career decisions.","923":"","924":"","925":"","926":"","927":"Twenty-six ultrasound therapy devices in clinical use in Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario were tested for performance compliance with Canadian government standards of functioning. The performance characteristics measured were the temporal average acoustic power output, the electrical impulse frequency to the transducer, and the timer accuracy. Twenty-one of the 26 units (81%) had power levels which differed by more than +\/- 20% of the indicated output, and only five units (19%) had all tested power levels within +\/- 20% of the indicated output. Seven units (27%) had inaccurate timers, but only one unit (of the 13 tested) had an unacceptable frequency reading. This study supports the results of other investigations which have suggested that the majority of ultrasound therapy units in clinical use are in need of calibration. This situation needs to be corrected immediately if patients are to receive the prescribed doses of ultrasound radiation for treatment purposes both safely and effectively. Possible courses of action for rectifying these problems are discussed.","928":"","929":"A readership survey was undertaken in 1981 by the editorial board of PHYSIOTHERAPY CANADA in order to identify the readers, ascertain their preferences and obtain their evaluation of the present content of the Journal. A questionnaire and a pre-addressed, prepaid response-card were included in the regular mailing of the January\/February 1981 issue of the Journal. Analysis of the resulting data produced both descriptive and inferential statistics. Of the 6478 targeted population (readers on the mailing list), 440 (6.8%) replied. The response rate of physiotherapists was 7.3%. Although the low response rate makes it difficult to generalize the results to the readership at large, some helpful information was obtained. The majority of the respondents (84.3%) were physiotherapists, involved in clinical work (75.5%). Eighty-two per cent had never published an article. Although PHYSIOTHERAPY CANADA was the sole journal consulted by 29.7% of respondents, another 50.4% did consult from one to three additional journals. A clear preference for clinical articles was expressed. The low rate of publication claimed by respondents, however, and their predilection for using the Journal as a source of information rather than as a vehicle for disseminating reports of their own work, makes it difficult for the Journal to comply with their request.","930":"The tonic vibration reflex -- elicitation of a muscle contraction by mechanical vibration -- is a well documented physiological phenomenon of particular relevance to physiotherapy. Among the critical features pertaining to the effectiveness of its use in clinical practice are the mechanical attributes of the vibrator used to elicit the reflex. Because physiological responses differ with vibrations of varying frequency and amplitude, it is necessary to measure these characteristics before a commercial vibrator is used therapeutically: Facilities and equipment for performing such tests are, however, not readily available to physiotherapists. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to measure and compare frequencies of a variety of commercially available vibrators under varying load conditions and over time. Vibrators from major Canadian retail outlets and manufacturers were obtained and, through the use of both mechanical and optical methods, a total of 19 models were frequency-calibrated. The results of the study permit discussion related to the suitability and reliability of each model and provide specific guidance to physiotherapy departments in the selection of appropriate therapeutic vibrators. The results also indicate that the mode of application, such as strapping the apparatus to the patient rather than having the operator hold it in her hand, affects the frequency in some models. The data related to frequency measurements, gained through this study, should enable therapists to make more effective use of commercially available vibrators in motor reeducation.","931":"A survey was undertaken to investigate the current practice and the actual need for physical therapy in the relatively new area of neonatal intensive care. The opinions of professionals within five groupings at six hospitals with neonatal intensive care units were solicited. A hypothetical situation of the ideal physical therapy service in neonatal intensive care was presented to the respondents who were then asked to compare such ideal services with those currently provided in the units surveyed. The results indicated that the majority of those surveyed consider the physical therapist to be an important member of the health team in a neonatal intensive care unit. Expansion of physical therapy services, with regard to both availability and areas of involvement, appears desirable. Both the conclusions derived from a review of the literature and the survey's results indicate that more research in neonatal physical therapy is needed.","932":"","933":"This paper examines the role of the physiotherapist in the care of patients whose conditions have reached the point at which intensive active treatment is no longer appropriate and is, therefore, replaced by palliative care directed toward the comfort and support of the patients and their families. The principles of physiotherapy in the delivery of palliative care (modified treatment aims, team approach, and acceptance of death), the possible contexts--both physical and psychological--of effective palliative care, and the attitudinal characteristics of physiotherapists best suited to the implementation of effective palliative care are discussed. The results of a survey of Canadian undergraduate training in physiotherapeutic palliative care, and the present level and method of instruction in this area, are included. The article demonstrates how the physiotherapist can play a central role in the multidisciplinary approach to terminal patient care by assisting patients to make the most of their decreasing potentials, by encouraging them to set short-term goals, and by relieving them of their discomfort.","934":"This paper describes the multifaceted chest rehabilitation program at a referral-teaching hospital in Saskatchewan. The program was developed following recognition of the special needs of rural patients undergoing treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has evolved to include three aspects. The first is concerned with the rural patient as an inpatient who participates in chest, exercise and education classes, in conjunction with medical treatment, and whose discharge needs are recognized and acted upon while in hospital. The second aspect is that of the one-day educational workshop aimed at outpatients not yet requiring hospitalization. The third aspect pertains to the educational seminars organized to help the rural health professional in fulfilling a role in his or her community, whether assisting patients with COPD at home or in hospital. In the future, in order to assess the efficacy of this multifaceted program, a formal research study devised according to the data obtained through a preliminary survey of 101 of the program's inpatients should be undertaken.","935":"This paper presents a basic methodology for an effective and efficient retrieval and recording of written materials in a subject area. The purpose of the literature review is examined and the criteria for selection of materials for inclusion are outlined. The methodology then describes the role of the librarian, various types of information resources, how to choose appropriate indexing and abstracting services, and a simple efficient method of recording the items found. The importance and use of Medical Subject Headings for research in physiotherapy is emphasized. A survey of types of book materials and how to locate them is followed by a detailed description of the most useful indexing and abstracting services available, in particular, the publications of the National Library of Medicine, notably Index Medicus, as well as Excerpta Medica and the Science Citation Index. A discussion of on-line search services, their coverage and availability in Canada, concludes the review of information sources. Finally, guidelines for selecting and summarizing the materials located and comments on the literary style for a review are supplied.","936":"A study of the professional relationship between physicians and physiotherapists, as perceived by physiotherapists, was undertaken. An analysis of the replies of a sample of physiotherapists to 20 closed-ended questions is presented in the context of the controversy about the proper relationship between medicine and physiotherapy. The data reveal that physiotherapists wish to strengthen their bond with physicians, but are not satisfied with the performance of doctors as team leaders, consultants, and resource personnel. It is possible, the data suggest, that the physician may not be the best qualified to act as team leader in every situation, for every aspect of medical treatment, for the care of every patient.","937":"Employee fitness programs, which have become increasingly popular in industrial settings, particularly over the past decade, are now also gaining favour in the hospital environment. Whereas employers are interested in the positive relationships between physical fitness, absenteeism and work performance, employees, as a result of participation in fitness activities, enjoy a more positive outlook on life. This paper discusses several points which might be considered during the development of a fitness program for employees, such as: persuading administrators of the need; generating employee interest; pre-testing participants; and actual program planning. The organization of the program -- it frequency and duration, and the warm-up, training and cool-down periods -- is also outlined.","938":"During the 80's, physiotherapists will have to deal with many important issues such as effective legislation; the basic educational requirement for CPA membership; changes in the code of ethics; accreditation of educational and clinical programs; and standards for quality of care. The greatest challenge for physiotherapists may, however, lie in provision of cost-effective treatment. As governments shift from bedded to non-bedded services, the opportunities for physiotherapists to provide outpatient services may lie in increased private practice operations and the expanded services of community health centres, home care unit, and mobile clinics traveling to remote rural communities. Increasing demands by government and consumer groups for quality control of services provided will create a need for clinical research, to make certain that treatments are effective. Physiotherapists must continue to ensure that increases in the profession's basic educational requirement, body of knowledge, level of specialization, leadership development, resources, and status in the health team are adequate to meet the future expectations of the public sector. The problems facing physiotherapists in the '80s revolve around their credibility--as a professional groups, as clinicians and researchers in a specific field, and as members of a helping profession.","939":"In these days of rising health care expenditures and public demand for physiotherapy services, physiotherapy managers are faced with many decisions regarding demands for services which run counter to budgetary limitations. This paper presents a new methodology -- Functional Value Analysis (FVA) -- which the physiotherapy department manager can use as one solution to his problem of continuing the provision of services while under financial constraints. Functional Value Analysis is a process that can be used to analyze and determine the cost of various activities that occur in a physiotherapy department. This process can also be used to generate cost-saving ideas and to priorize them. The Task Force Committee of a Manitoban hospital wanted cost-saving ideas, for 30 per cent of its budget, documented. Therefore, the physiotherapy department, along with other professional service departments at the hospital, undertook such an FVA study in October of 1978. Out of the physiotherapy departments annual budget of $615,960, the department was able to document cost-saving ideas of $267,346. Functional Value Analysis is one tool for a department manager's use which can reduce costs in an organized logical manner.","940":"","941":"Physical therapy educators require specific information about the number of graduates who remain in the profession and about their opinions related to undergraduate training and their postgraduate requirements. A mail questionnaire survey of physical therapists who graduated from an Ontario university's physical therapy program between 1969 and 1978 was conducted to determine: occupational patterns, satisfaction with undergraduate preparation for employment, interest in graduate studies and, if the graduate was unemployed at that time, the need for re-entry preparation for employment. With one follow-up mailing to non-respondents, a response rate of 93.4 per cent was obtained. Of the 141 respondents, 110 were working full-time and 15 were working part-time in physical therapy. Eighty-eight per cent of employed physical therapy graduates agreed that their education had prepared them sufficiently for employment. Fifty-three per cent of the graduates indicated that they would like to pursue an area of clinical specialization through graduate study. It is concluded that the graduates of the program under study believe that they have been well prepared for employment; not only do they maintain a clinical interest in the profession, but they aspire to personal and professional advancement through graduate studies.","942":"","943":"A 12-month trial of a community television series entitled Physiotherapy and Your Health has been completed. The evolution and philosophy of the series are described.

The study of man-environment phenomena and the adoption of an ecosystemic view of these phenomena are proposed as essential elements, providing the 'attitudinal' context from which a comprehensive approach to problem identification and solution might be derived. The design and development of devices and environments for the disabled is presented within a proposed model of rehabilitation design. A model of the design process is also presented and both seek to establish a general systemic understanding of this field of intervention.","945":"","946":"The purpose of this paper is to describe how professional excellence can be maintained by participation in continuing education, thus avoiding professional obsolescence, and to describe essential factors in planning programs. Health professionals must recognize that lifetime licensure in a health care field is no longer a viable method of operation. Mandatory recertification requiring continuing educational experiences seems to present a possible alternative. Factors that contribute to professional obsolescence are reviewed and a rationale supporting continuing educational experience is developed. It is argued that health care professionals must participate in lifelong educational experience to maintain professional competence. Processes for planning continuing education programs for health professionals are reviewed. Seven steps necessary for program planning are outlined: set the philosophy, goals, objectives, obstacles, scope and the control and evaluation guidelines. The factors that reduce resistance to change and facilitate planning are discussed. The author concludes by noting that the health professional will become incompetent and a danger to the health care delivery system if he or she ignores the need for continuing education.","947":"Bacteria which flourish in untreated whirlpool and hubbard tank water may cause disease in people who are elderly, debilitated, or on antibiotics. This study compared various bactericidal agents in order to find the most economical, convenient and effective way to prevent infection occurring in patients undergoing hydrotherapy. Samples of water from a hubbard tank and two whirlpool baths were tested for colony count and culture before, during and after use, while regular patient loads and cleaning procedures were in effect. A germicidal detergent, an iodophor, and two chlorine agents were tried in succession. Acceptability to patients, effectiveness against bacteria, cost, and ease of handling were compared. The germicidal detergent only killed some bacteria and was very foamy. The iodophor was expensive and stained the tanks. Household bleach was unreliable in its effect hard to handle, and produced many complaints of \"chlorine\" smell. Stabilized granular chlorine treatment of the water provided an excellent infection control method for the physiotherapy department in this study.","948":"Many physical therapists lack an understanding of the prociples and applications of objective measurement methods in the clinical environment. This paper presents a working definition of the parameters of motor performance (analyzed in terms of outcome or process) as well as an explanation of measurement systems, particularly those related to measurements of position and motion (goniometers and photography), force (dynamometers and force gauges), and muscle activity (electromyography).","949":"An approach to quality assurance in the physiotherapy department of the University Hospital in London, Ontario, is presented. The importance of assessing the quality of care is stressed. To reach a level at which quality can be assessed, a system of recording must be developed, complete with guidelines; this recording system can then be audited. A method of recording--the Problem Oriented Method of Recording, or the Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR)--and a method of auditing are presented and discussed. Prospects for future audits are also discussed. The importance of sharing knowledge with other physiotherapists, by establishing criteria with which critical evaluation of physiotherapeutic treatments can be performed, is pointed out.","950":"Government control over health spending and public demands for improved services have increasingly stimulated professional activity in methods of evaluating the quality of patient care. This paper discusses three distinct approaches to evaluation: evaluation of structure, process and outcome. A well-rounded system of quality appraisal should probably include concurrent or co-ordinated assessments of all three methods, to the extent that each of these is observable and measurable under the constraints inherent in any given setting.
