identification of FACT as a histone chaperone enabling transcription through chromatin in vitro has strongly shaped how its roles are envisioned. However, FACT has been implicated in essentially all aspects of chromatin biology, from transcription to DNA replication, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation. In this review, we focus on recent literature describing the role and mechanisms of FACT during transcription. We highlight the prime importance of FACT in preserving chromatin integrity during transcription and challenge its role as an elongation factor. We also review evidence for FACT's role as a cell-type\/gene-specificregulator of gene expression and briefly summarize current efforts at using FACT inhibition as an anti-cancerstrategy.","1":"RNA modifications are prevalent among all the classes of RNA, regulate diverse biological processes, and have emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. They are subjected to precise spatial and temporal control and shown to be critical for the maintenance of normal development and physiology. For example, m6A modification of mRNA affects stability, recruitment of RNA binding protein (RBP), translation, and splicing. The deposition of m6A on the RNA happens co-transcriptionally, allowing the tight coupling between the transcription and RNA modification machinery. The m6A modification is affected by transcriptional dynamics, but recent insights also suggest that m6A machinery impacts transcription and chromatin signature.","2":"The Integrator was originally discovered as a specialized 3'-end processing endonuclease complex required for maturation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Since its discovery, Integrator's spectrum of substrates was significantly expanded to include non-polyadenylated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), telomerase RNA (tertRNA), several Herpesvirus transcripts, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Recently emerging transcriptome-wide studies reveled an important role of the Integrator in protein-coding genes, where it contributes to gene expression regulation through promoter-proximal transcription attenuation. These new functional data are complemented by several structures of Integrator modules and higher-order complexes, providing mechanistic insights into Integrator-mediated processing events. In this work, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the structure and function of the Integrator complex.","3":"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) consists of YSPTSPS heptapeptide repeats, and the phosphorylation status of the repeats controls multiple transcriptional steps and co-transcriptional events. However, how CTD phosphorylation status responds to distinct environmental stresses is not fully understood. In this study, we found that a drastic reduction in phosphorylation of a subset of Ser2 residues occurs rapidly but transiently following exposure to H2O2. ChIP analysis indicated that Ser2-P, and to a lesser extent Tyr1-P was reduced only at the gene 3' end. Significantly, the levels of polyadenylation factor CstF77, as well as Pol II, were also reduced. However, no increase in uncleaved or readthrough RNA products was observed, suggesting transcribing Pol II prematurely terminates at the gene end in response to H2O2. Further analysis found that the reduction of Ser2-P is, at least in part, regulated by CK2 but independent of FCP1 and other known Ser2 phosphatases. Finally, the H2O2 treatment also affected snRNA 3' processing although surprisingly the U2 processing was not impaired. Together, our data suggest that H2O2 exposure creates a unique CTD phosphorylation state that rapidly alters transcription to deal with acute oxidative stress, perhaps creating a novel \"emergency brake\" mechanism to transiently dampen gene expression.","4":"","5":"During transcription, RNA polymerase (RNAP) translocates along the helical template DNA while maintaining high transcriptional fidelity. However, all genomes are dynamically twisted, writhed, and decorated by bound proteins and motor enzymes. In prokaryotes, proteins bound to DNA, specifically or not, frequently compact DNA into conformations that may silence genes by obstructing RNAP. Collision of RNAPs with these architectural proteins, may result in RNAP stalling and\/or displacement of the protein roadblock. It is important to understand how rapidly transcribing RNAPs operate under different levels of supercoiling or in the presence of roadblocks. Given the broad range of asynchronous dynamics exhibited by transcriptional complexes, single-molecule assays, such as atomic force microscopy, fluorescence detection, optical and magnetic tweezers, etc. are well suited for detecting and quantifying activity with adequate spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we summarize current understanding of the effects of torsion and roadblocks on prokaryotic transcription, with a focus on single-molecule assays that provide real-time detection and readout.","6":null,"7":"Rho is a hexameric bacterial RNA helicase, which became a paradigm of factor-dependent transcription termination. The broadly accepted (\"textbook\") model posits a series of steps, wherein Rho first binds C-rich Rho utilization (rut) sites on nascent RNA, uses its ATP-dependent translocase activity to catch up with RNA polymerase (RNAP), and either pulls the transcript from the elongation complex or pushes RNAP forward, thus terminating transcription. However, this appealingly simple mechano-chemical model lacks a biological realism and is increasingly at odds with genetic and biochemical data. Here, we summarize recent structural and biochemical studies that have advanced our understanding of molecular details of RNA recognition, termination signaling, and RNAP inactivation in Rho-dependent transcription termination, rebalancing the view in favor of an alternative \"allosteric\" mechanism. In the revised model, Rho binds RNAP early in elongation assisted by the cofactors NusA and NusG, forming a pre-termination complex (PTC). The formation of PTC allows Rho to continuously sample nascent transcripts for a termination signal, which subsequently traps the elongation complex in an inactive state prior to its dissociation.","8":"For survival, bacteria need to continuously evolve and adapt to complex environments, including those that may impact the integrity of the DNA, the repository of genetic information to be passed on to future generations. The multiple factors of DNA repair share the substrate on which they operate with other key cellular machineries, principally those of replication and transcription, implying a high degree of coordination of DNA-based activities. In this review, I focus on progress made in the understanding of the protein factors operating at the crossroads of these three fundamental processes, with emphasis on the mutation frequency decline protein (Mfd, aka TRCF). Although Mfd research has a rich history that goes back in time for more than half a century, recent reports hint that much remains to be uncovered. I argue that besides being a transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF), Mfd is also a global regulator of transcription and a pro-mutagenic factor, and that the way it interfaces with transcription, replication and nucleotide excision repair makes it an attractive candidate for the development of strategies to curb molecular evolution, hence, antibiotic resistance.","9":"Coordination between the molecular machineries that synthesize and decode prokaryotic mRNAs is an important layer of gene expression control known as transcription-translation coupling. While it has long been known that translation can regulate transcription and vice-versa, recent structural and biochemical work has shed light on the underlying mechanistic basis. Complexes of RNA polymerase linked to a trailing ribosome (expressomes) have been structurally characterized in a variety of states at near-atomic resolution, and also directly visualized in cells. These data are complemented by recent biochemical and biophysical analyses of transcription-translation systems and the individual components within them. Here, we review our improved understanding of the molecular basis of transcription-translation coupling. These insights are discussed in relation to our evolving understanding of the role of coupling in cells.","10":"Genome architecture has proven to be critical in determining gene regulation across almost all domains of life. While many of the key components and mechanisms of eukaryotic genome organization have been described, the interplay between bacterial DNA organization and gene regulation is only now being fully appreciated. An increasing pool of evidence has demonstrated that the bacterial chromosome can reasonably be thought of as chromatin, and that bacterial chromosomes contain transcriptionally silent and transcriptionally active regions analogous to heterochromatin and euchromatin, respectively. The roles played by histones in eukaryotic systems appear to be shared across a range of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) in bacteria, which function to compact, structure, and regulate large portions of bacterial chromosomes. The broad range of extant NAPs, and the extent to which they differ from species to species, has raised additional challenges in identifying and characterizing their roles in all but a handful of model bacteria. Here we review the regulatory roles played by NAPs in several well-studied bacteria and use the resulting state of knowledge to provide a working definition for NAPs, based on their function, binding pattern, and expression levels. We present a screening procedure which can be applied to any species for which transcriptomic data are available. Finally, we note that NAPs tend to play two major regulatory roles - xenogeneic silencers and developmental regulators - and that many unrecognized potential NAPs exist in each bacterial species examined.","11":"Bacteria in most natural environments spend substantial periods of time limited for essential nutrients and not actively dividing. While transcriptional activity under these conditions is substantially reduced compared to that occurring during active growth, observations from diverse organisms and experimental approaches have shown that new transcription still occurs and is important for survival. Much of our understanding of transcription regulation has come from measuring transcripts in exponentially growing cells, or from in vitro experiments focused on transcription from highly active promoters by the housekeeping RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The fact that transcription during growth arrest occurs at low levels and is highly heterogeneous has posed challenges for its study. However, new methods of measuring low levels of gene expression activity, even in single cells, offer exciting opportunities for directly investigating transcriptional activity and its regulation during growth arrest. Furthermore, much of the rich structural and biochemical data from decades of work on the bacterial transcriptional machinery is also relevant to growth arrest. In this review, the physiological changes likely affecting transcription during growth arrest are first considered. Next, possible adaptations to help facilitate ongoing transcription during growth arrest are discussed. Finally, new insights from several recently published datasets investigating mRNA transcripts in single bacterial cells at various growth phases will be explored. Keywords: Growth arrest, stationary phase, RNA polymerase, nucleoid condensation, population heterogeneity.","12":null,"13":"The N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 is an important regulator of protein\/DNA interactions and plays a role in many cellular processes, including mitosis, cell cycle progression, chromatin organization, DNA damage repair, and transcriptional regulation. Accordingly, loss of NRMT1 results in both developmental pathologies and oncogenic phenotypes. Though NRMT1 plays such important and diverse roles in the cell, little is known about its own regulation. To better understand the mechanisms governing NRMT1 expression, we first identified its predominant transcriptional start site and minimal promoter region with predicted transcription factor motifs. We then used a combination of luciferase and binding assays to confirm CREB1 as the major regulator of NRMT1 transcription. We tested which conditions known to activate CREB1 also activated NRMT1 transcription, and found CREB1-mediated NRMT1 expression was increased during recovery from serum starvation and muscle cell differentiation. To determine how NRMT1 expression affects myoblast differentiation, we used CRISPR\/Cas9 technology to knock out NRMT1 expression in immortalized C2C12 mouse myoblasts. C2C12 cells depleted of NRMT1 lacked Pax7 expression and were unable to proceed down the muscle differentiation pathway. Instead, they took on characteristics of C2C12 cells that have transdifferentiated into osteoblasts, including increased alkaline phosphatase and type I collagen expression and decreased proliferation. These data implicate NRMT1 as an important downstream target of CREB1 during muscle cell differentiation.","14":"Recent studies have identified multiple polyadenylation sites in nearly all mammalian genes. Although these are interpreted as evidence for alternative polyadenylation, our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is still limited. Most studies only consider the immediate surroundings of gene ends, even though in vitro experiments have uncovered the involvement of external factors such as splicing. Whereas in vivo splicing manipulation was impracticable until recently, we now used mutants in the Death Inducer Obliterator (DIDO) gene to study their impact on 3' end processing. We observe multiple rounds of readthrough and gene fusions, suggesting that no arbitration between polyadenylation sites occurs. Instead, a window of opportunity seems to control end processing. Through the identification of T-rich sequence motifs, our data indicate that splicing and transcriptional pausing interact to regulate alternative polyadenylation. We propose that 3' splice site activation comprises a variable timer, which determines how long transcription proceeds before polyadenylation signals are recognized. Thus, the role of core polyadenylation signals could be more passive than commonly believed. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of alternative polyadenylation and expand the catalog of related aberrations.Abbreviations APA: alternative polyadenylation; bp: basepair; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; PA: polyadenylation; PAS: polyadenylation site; Pol II: (RNA) polymerase II ; RT-PCR:reverse-transcriptase PCR; SF:splicing factor; SFPQ:splicing factor rich in proline and glutamine; SS:splice site; TRSM:Thymidine rich sequence motif; UTR:untranslated terminal region.","15":"Noncoding RNAs are proclaimed to be expressed in various cancer types and one such type is found to be pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) affect the migration, invasion, and growth of tumor cells by playing important roles in the process of epigenesis, post-transcription, and transcriptional regulation along with the maintenance of apoptosis and cell cycle. It is quite subtle whether the alterations in lncRNAs would impact PDAC progression and development. This review throws a spotlight on the lncRNAs associated with tumor functions: MALAT-1, HOTAIR, HOXA13, H19, LINC01559, LINC00460, SNHG14, SNHG16, DLX6-AS1, MSC-AS1, ABHD11-AS1, DUXAP8, DANCR, XIST, DLEU2, etc. are upregulated lncRNAs whereas GAS5, HMlincRNA717, MIAT, LINC01111, lncRNA KCNK15-AS1, etc. are downregulated lncRNAs inhibiting the invasion and progression of PDAC. These data provided helps in the assessment of lncRNAs in the development, metastasis, and occurrence of PDAC and also play a vital role in the evolution of biomarkers and therapeutic agents for the treatment of PDAC.","16":"Diverse models have been advanced for the evolution of the genetic code. Here, models for tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and genetic code evolution were combined with an understanding of EF-Tu suppression of tRNA 3rd anticodon position wobbling. The result is a highly detailed scheme that describes the placements of all amino acids in the standard genetic code. The model describes evolution of 6-, 4-, 3-, 2- and 1-codon sectors. Innovation in column 3 of the code is explained. Wobbling and code degeneracy are explained. Separate distribution of serine sectors between columns 2 and 4 of the code is described. We conclude that very little chaos contributed to evolution of the genetic code and that the pattern of evolution of aaRS enzymes describes a history of the evolution of the code. A model is proposed to describe the biological selection for the earliest evolution of the code and for protocell evolution.","17":"The innate immune system has numerous signal transduction pathways that lead to the production of type I interferons in response to exposure of cells to external stimuli. One of these pathways comprises RNA polymerase (Pol) III that senses common DNA viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, vaccinia, herpes simplex virus-1 and varicella zoster virus. This polymerase detects and transcribes viral genomic regions to generate AU-rich transcripts that bring to the induction of type I interferons. Remarkably, Pol III is also stimulated by foreign non-viral DNAs and expression of one of its subunits is induced by an RNA virus, the Sindbis virus. Moreover, a protein subunit of RNase P, which is known to associate with Pol III in initiation complexes, is induced by viral infection. Accordingly, alliance of the two tRNA enzymes in innate immunity merits a consideration.","18":"","19":"Multisubunit RNA polymerase (Pol) complexes are the core machinery for gene expression in eukaryotes. The enzymes Pol I, Pol II and Pol III transcribe distinct subsets of nuclear genes. This family of nuclear RNA polymerases expanded in terrestrial plants by the duplication of Pol II subunit genes. Two Pol II-related enzymes, Pol IV and Pol V, are highly specialized in the production of regulatory, non-coding RNAs. Pol IV and Pol V are the central players of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), an RNA interference pathway that represses transposable elements (TEs) and selected genes. Genetic and biochemical analyses of Pol IV\/V subunits are now revealing how these enzymes evolved from ancestral Pol II to sustain non-coding RNA biogenesis in silent chromatin. Intriguingly, Pol IV-RdDM regulates genes that influence flowering time, reproductive development, stress responses and plant-pathogen interactions. Pol IV target genes vary among closely related taxa, indicating that these regulatory circuits are often species-specific. Data from crops like maize, rice, tomato and Brassica rapa suggest that dynamic repositioning of TEs, accompanied by Pol IV targeting to TE-proximal genes, leads to the reprogramming of plant gene expression over short evolutionary timescales.","20":"A large number of distal cis-regulatory elements (cREs) have been annotated in the human genome, which plays a central role in orchestrating spatiotemporal gene expression. Since many cREs regulate non-adjacent genes, long-range cRE-promoter interactions are an important factor in the functional characterization of the engaged cREs. In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that identification of long-range target genes can decipher the effect of genetic mutations residing within cREs on abnormal gene expression. In addition, investigation of altered long-range cREs-promoter interactions induced by chromosomal rearrangements has revealed their critical roles in pathogenic gene expression. In this review, we briefly discuss how the analysis of 3D chromatin structure can help us understand the functional impact of cREs harboring disease-associated genetic variants and how chromosomal rearrangements disrupting topologically associating domains can lead to pathogenic gene expression.","21":"Increasingly sophisticated biochemical and genetic techniques are unraveling the regulatory factors and mechanisms that control gene expression in the Archaea. While some similarities in regulatory strategies are universal, archaeal-specific regulatory strategies are emerging to complement a complex patchwork of shared archaeal-bacterial and archaeal-eukaryotic regulatory mechanisms employed in the archaeal domain. The prokaryotic archaea encode core transcription components with homology to the eukaryotic transcription apparatus and also share a simplified eukaryotic-like initiation mechanism, but also deploy tactics common to bacterial systems to regulate promoter usage and influence elongation-termination decisions. We review the recently established complete archaeal transcription cycle, highlight recent findings of the archaeal transcription community and detail the expanding post-initiation regulation imposed on archaeal transcription.","22":"Chromatin accessibility is generally perceived as a common property of active regulatory elements where transcription factors are recruited via DNA-specific interactions and other physico-chemical properties to regulate gene transcription. Recent work in the context of mitosis provides less trivial and potentially more interesting relationships than previously anticipated.","23":"Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental conditions by reprogramming gene expression in response to stress or to drive developmental transitions. Among the many signals that plants perceive, light and temperature are of particular interest due to their intensely fluctuating nature which is combined with a long-term seasonal trend. Whereas specific receptors are key in the light-sensing mechanism, the identity of plant thermosensors for high and low temperatures remains far from fully addressed. This review aims at discussing common as well as divergent characteristics of gene expression regulation in plants, controlled by light and temperature. Light and temperature signaling control the abundance of specific transcription factors, as well as the dynamics of co-transcriptional processes such as RNA polymerase elongation rate and alternative splicing patterns. Additionally, sensing both types of cues modulates gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape and through the induction of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, while light sensing is channeled through dedicated receptors, temperature can broadly affect chemical reactions inside plant cells. Thus, direct thermal modifications of the transcriptional machinery add another level of complexity to plant transcriptional regulation. Besides the rapid transcriptome changes that follow perception of environmental signals, plant developmental transitions and acquisition of stress tolerance depend on long-term maintenance of transcriptional states (active or silenced genes). Thus, the rapid transcriptional response to the signal (Phase I) can be distinguished from the long-term memory of the acquired transcriptional state (Phase II - remembering the signal). In this review we discuss recent advances in light and temperature signal perception, integration and memory in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on transcriptional regulation and highlighting the contrasting and unique features of each type of cue in the process.","24":"Most living organisms possess an internal timekeeping mechanism known as the circadian clock, which enhances fitness by synchronizing the internal timing of biological processes with diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. In plants, the pace of these biological rhythms relies on oscillations in the expression level of hundreds of genes tightly controlled by a group of core clock regulators and co-regulators that engage in transcriptional and translational feedback loops. In the last decade, the role of several core clock genes in the control of defense responses has been addressed, and a growing amount of evidence demonstrates that circadian regulation is relevant for plant immunity. A reciprocal connection between these pathways was also established following the observation that in Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as in crop species like tomato, plant-pathogen interactions trigger a reconfiguration of the circadian transcriptional network. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the interaction between the circadian clock and biotic stress responses at the transcriptional level, and discuss the relevance of this crosstalk in the plant-pathogen evolutionary arms race. A better understanding of these processes could aid in the development of genetic tools that improve traditional breeding practices, enhancing tolerance to plant diseases that threaten crop yield and food security all around the world.","25":"Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences with the ability to replicate across genomes and generate mutations with major transcriptional effects. Epigenetic silencing mechanisms that target TEs to limit their activity, including DNA methylation, add to the range of gene expression variants generated by TEs. Here, using the iconic gene flowering locus C (FLC) as a case study I discuss the multiple ways by which TEs can affect the expression of genes and contribute to the adaptation of plants to changing environments.","26":"Plants have a high level of developmental plasticity that allows them to respond and adapt to changes in the environment. Among the environmental cues, light controls almost every aspect of A. thaliana's life cycle, including seed maturation, seed germination, seedling de-etiolation and flowering time. Light signals induce massive reprogramming of gene expression, producing changes in RNA polymerase II transcription, alternative splicing, and chromatin state. Since splicing reactions occur mainly while transcription takes place, the regulation of RNAPII transcription has repercussions in the splicing outcomes. This cotranscriptional nature allows a functional coupling between transcription and splicing, in which properties of the splicing reactions are affected by the transcriptional process. Chromatin landscapes influence both transcription and splicing. In this review, we highlight, summarize and discuss recent progress in the field to gain a comprehensive insight on the cross-regulation between chromatin state, RNAPII transcription and splicing decisions in plants, with a special focus on light-triggered responses. We also introduce several examples of transcription and splicing factors that could be acting as coupling factors in plants. Unravelling how these connected regulatory networks operate, can help in the design of better crops with higher productivity and tolerance.","27":"","28":"Transcription elongation is a highly regulated process affected by many proteins, RNAs and the underlying DNA. Here we show that the nascent RNA can interfere with transcription in human cells, extending our previous findings from bacteria and yeast. We identified a variety of Pol II-binding aptamers (RAPs), prominent in repeat elements such as ACRO1 satellites, LINE1 retrotransposons and CA simple repeats, and also in several protein-coding genes. ACRO1 repeat, when translated in silico, exhibits ~50% identity with the Pol II CTD sequence. Taken together with a recent proposal that proteins in general tend to interact with RNAs similar to their cognate mRNAs, this suggests a mechanism for RAP binding. Using a reporter construct, we show that ACRO1 potently inhibits Pol II elongation in cis. We propose a novel mode of transcriptional regulation in humans, in which the nascent RNA binds Pol II to silence its own expression.","29":null,"30":"The advent of novel high-throughput sequencing techniques has revealed that eukaryotic genomes are massively transcribed although only a small fraction of RNAs exhibits protein-coding capacity. In the last years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of eukaryotic gene expression in a wide range of molecular mechanisms. Plant lncRNAs can be transcribed by alternative RNA polymerases, acting directly as long transcripts or can be processed into active small RNAs. Several lncRNAs have been recently shown to interact with chromatin, DNA or nuclear proteins to condition the epigenetic environment of target genes or modulate the activity of transcriptional complexes. In this review, we will summarize the recent discoveries about the actions of plant lncRNAs in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level.","31":"The production of mRNA is a dynamic process that is highly regulated by reversible post-translational modifications of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The CTD is a highly repetitive domain consisting mostly of the consensus heptad sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. Phosphorylation of serine residues within this repeat sequence is well studied, but modifications of all residues have been described. Here, we focus on integrating newly identified and lesser-studied CTD post-translational modifications into the existing framework. We also review the growing body of work demonstrating crosstalk between different CTD modifications and the functional consequences of such crosstalk on the dynamics of transcriptional regulation.","32":"","33":"","34":"Enhancers are cis-acting elements with many sites bound by transcription factors and activate transcription over long distance. Histone modifications are critical for enhancer activity and utilized as hallmarks for the identification of putative enhancers. Monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is the mark for enhancer priming; acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) for active enhancers and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) for silent enhancers. Recent studies from multiple groups have provided evidence that enhancer reprogramming, especially gain of enhancer activity, is closely related to tumorigenesis and cancer development. In this review, we will summarize the recent discoveries about enhancer regulation and the mechanisms of enhancer reprogramming in tumorigenesis, and discuss the potential application of enhancer manipulation in precision medicine.","35":"Recent biophysical studies of mycobacterial transcription have shed new light on this fundamental process in a group of bacteria that includes deadly pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), Mycobacterium leprae (Mlp), as well as the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm). Most of the research has focused on Mtb, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the top ten causes of death globally. The enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP) is responsible for all bacterial transcription and is a target for one of the crucial antibiotics used for TB treatment, rifampicin (Rif). Here, we summarize recent biophysical studies of mycobacterial RNAP that have advanced our understanding of the basic process of transcription, have revealed novel paradigms for regulation, and thus have provided critical information required for developing new antibiotics against this deadly disease.","36":"Nascent transcription assays, such as global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), have uncovered a myriad of unstable RNAs being actively produced from numerous sites genome-wide. These transcripts provide a more complete and immediate picture of the impact of regulatory events. Transcription factors recruit RNA polymerase II, effectively initiating the process of transcription; repressors inhibit polymerase recruitment. Efficiency of recruitment is dictated by sequence elements in and around the RNA polymerase loading zone. A combination of sequence elements and RNA binding proteins subsequently influence the ultimate stability of the resulting transcript. Some of these transcripts are capable of providing feedback on the process, influencing subsequent transcription. By monitoring RNA polymerase activity, nascent assays provide insights into every step of the regulated process of transcription.","37":null,"38":"Since the discovery that enhancers can support transcription, the roles of enhancer RNAs have remained largely elusive. We identified that enhancer RNAs interact with and augment bromodomain engagement with acetylated chromatin. Here, we discuss our recent findings and the potential mechanisms underlying the regulation and functions of enhancer RNA-bromodomain associations.","39":"FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions) is a highly conserved histone chaperone complex in eukaryotic cells that can interact and manipulate nucleosomes in order to promote a variety of DNA-based processes and to maintain the integrity of chromatin throughout the genome. Whereas key features of the physical interactions that occur between FACT and nucleosomes in vitro have been elucidated in recent years, less is known regarding FACT functional dynamics in vivo. Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae system, we now provide evidence that at least at some genes dissociation of the FACT subunit Spt16 from their 3' ends is partially dependent on RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) termination. Combined with other studies, our results are consistent with a two-phase mechanism for FACT dissociation from genes, one that occurs upstream from Pol II dissociation and is Pol II termination-independent and the other that occurs further downstream and is dependent on Pol II termination.","40":"The regulation of gene expression is a fundamental cellular process and its misregulation is a key component of disease. Enhancers are one of the most salient regulatory elements in the genome and help orchestrate proper spatiotemporal gene expression during development, in homeostasis, and in response to signaling. Notably, molecular aberrations at enhancers, such as translocations and single nucleotide polymorphisms, are emerging as an important source of human variation and susceptibility to disease. Herein we discuss emerging paradigms addressing how genes are regulated by enhancers, common features of active enhancers, and how non-coding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) can direct gene expression programs that underlie cellular phenotypes. We survey the current evidence, which suggests that eRNAs can bind to transcription factors, mediate enhancer-promoter interactions, influence RNA Pol II elongation, and act as decoys for repressive cofactors. Furthermore, we discuss current methodologies for the identification of eRNAs and novel approaches to elucidate their functions.","41":"Inorganic phosphate (Pi), a ubiquitous metabolite, is involved in all major biochemical pathways. We demonstrate that, in vitro, MgHPO4 (the intracellular Pi form) at physiological concentrations can exist in a metastable supersaturated dissolved state or as a precipitate. We have shown that in solution, MgHPO4 strongly stimulates exonuclease nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase. We report here that MgHPO4 precipitate selectively and efficiently inhibits transcription initiation in vitro. In view of the MgHPO4 solubility and in vitro sensitivity of RNA synthesis to MgHPO4 precipitate, at physiological concentrations, MgHPO4 should cause a 50-98% inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis, thus exerting a strong regulatory action. The effects of Pi on transcription in vivo will, therefore, reflect the physical state of intracellular Pi.","42":"Bacteriophages employ small proteins to usurp host molecular machinery, thereby interfering with central metabolic processes in infected bacteria. Generally, phages inhibit or redirect host transcription to favor transcription of their own genomes. Mechanistic and structural studies of phage-modulated host transcription may provide inspirations for the development of novel antibacterial substances.","43":"Circadian clocks regulate the rhythmic expression of thousands of genes underlying the daily oscillations of biological functions. Here, we discuss recent findings showing that circadian clock rhythmic transcriptional outputs rely on additional mechanisms than just clock gene DNA binding, which may ultimately contribute to the plasticity of circadian transcriptional programs.","44":"Gene expression involves multiple co- and post-transcriptional processes that have been increasingly found intertwined. A recent work by our groups (Chen et al. Mol Cell, 2019) indicates that expression of alternative polyadenylation isoforms in mammalian cells can be controlled by nuclear export activities. This regulation has distinct impacts on genes having different sizes and nucleotide contents, and involves RNA polymerase II distribution toward the 3' end of genes. This work raises a number of intriguing questions concerning how 3' end processing and nuclear export are integrated and how their regulation feeds back to transcription.","45":null,"46":"In eukaryotes, divergent transcription is a major source of noncoding RNAs. Recent studies have uncovered that in yeast, the transcription factor Rap1 restricts transcription in the divergent direction and thereby controls promoter directionality. Here, we summarize these findings, propose regulatory principles, and discuss the implications for eukaryotic gene regulation.","47":"","48":"Gene transcription is regulated with distinct sets of regulatory factors at multiple levels. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation constitute two major regulation modes of gene expression to either activate or repress the initiation of transcription and thereby control the number of proteins synthesized during translation. Disruptions of the proper regulation patterns at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels are increasingly recognized as causes of human diseases. Consequently, identifying the differential gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels respectively is vital to identify potential disease-associated and\/or causal genes and understand their roles in the disease development. Here, we proposed a novel method with a linear mixed model that can identify a set of differentially expressed genes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The simulation and real data analysis showed our method could provide an accurate way to identify genes subject to aberrant transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and reveal the potential causal genes that contributed to the diseases.","49":"We recently reported that the cyclin T1 histidine-rich domain creates a phase-separated environment to promote hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and robust transcriptional elongation by P-TEFb. Here, we discuss this and several other recent discoveries to demonstrate that phase separation is important for controlling various aspects of transcription.","50":"The Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and CDK19 function in the context of three additional proteins: CCNC and MED12, which activate CDK8\/CDK19 kinase function, and MED13, which enables their association with the Mediator complex. The Mediator kinases affect RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription indirectly, through phosphorylation of transcription factors and by controlling Mediator structure and function. In this review, we discuss cellular roles of the Mediator kinases and mechanisms that enable their biological functions. We focus on sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and other Mediator kinase substrates, and how CDK8 or CDK19 may enable metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming through enhancers and chromatin looping. We also summarize Mediator kinase inhibitors and their therapeutic potential. Throughout, we note conserved and divergent functions between yeast and mammalian CDK8, and highlight many aspects of kinase module function that remain enigmatic, ranging from potential roles in pol II promoter-proximal pausing to liquid-liquid phase separation.","51":"RNA processing encompasses the capping, cleavage, polyadenylation and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Proper muscle development relies on precise RNA processing, driven by the coordination between RNA-binding proteins. Recently, skeletal muscle biology has been intensely investigated in terms of RNA processing. High throughput studies paired with deletion of RNA-binding proteins have provided a high-level understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of RNA-processing in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, misregulation of RNA processing is implicated in muscle diseases. In this review, we comprehensively summarize recent studies in skeletal muscle that demonstrated: (i) the importance of RNA processing, (ii) the RNA-binding proteins that are involved, and (iii) diseases associated with defects in RNA processing.","52":null,"53":null,"54":"SAGA and NuA4 are coactivator complexes required for transcription on chromatin. Although they contain different enzymatic and biochemical activities, both contain the large Tra1 subunit. Recent electron microscopy studies have resolved the complete structure of Tra1 and its integration in SAGA\/NuA4, providing important insight into Tra1 function.","55":null,"56":"As the new millennium began, CDK12 and CDK13 were discovered as nucleotide sequences that encode protein kinases related to cell cycle CDKs. By the end of the first decade both proteins had been qualified as CTD kinases, and it was emerging that both are heterodimers containing a Cyclin K subunit. Since then, many studies on CDK12 have shown that, through phosphorylating the CTD of transcribing RNAPII, it plays critical roles in several stages of gene expression, notably RNA processing; it is also crucial for maintaining genome stability. Fewer studies on CKD13 have clearly shown that it is functionally distinct from CDK12. CDK13 is important for proper expression of a number of genes, but it also probably plays yet-to-be-discovered roles in other processes. This review summarizes much of the work on CDK12 and CDK13 and attempts to evaluate the results and place them in context. Our understanding of these two enzymes has begun to mature, but we still have much to learn about both. An indicator of one major area of medically-relevant future research comes from the discovery that CDK12 is a tumor suppressor, notably for certain ovarian and prostate cancers. A challenge for the future is to understand CDK12 and CDK13 well enough to explain how their loss promotes cancer development and how we can intercede to prevent or treat those cancers.

Recent genome-wide studies in yeast revealed that both complexes are required for the transcription of a vast majority of genes by RNA polymerase II raising new questions about the role of coactivators.","58":null,"59":"CHARGE syndrome is characterized by co-occurrence of multiple malformations due to abnormal development of neural crest cells. Here, we review the phenotypic and molecular overlap between CHARGE syndrome and similar pathologies, and further discuss the observation that neural crest cells appear especially sensitive to malfunction of the chromatin-transcription-splicing molecular hub.","60":"Frameshifting errors are common and mRNA quality control pathways, such as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), exist to degrade these aberrant transcripts. Recent work has shown the existence of a genetic link between NMD and codon-usage mediated mRNA decay. Here we present computational evidence that these pathways are synergic for removing frameshifts.","61":null,"62":"Every transcription cycle ends in termination when RNA polymerase dissociates from the DNA. Although conceptually simple, the mechanism has proven somewhat elusive in eukaryotic systems. Gene-editing and high resolution polymerase mapping now offer clarification of important steps preceding transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II in human cells.","63":"It was recently shown that removal of GreA, a transcription fidelity factor, enhances DNA break repair. This counterintuitive result, arising from unresolved backtracked RNA polymerase impeding DNA resection and thereby facilitating RecA-loading, leads to an interesting corollary: error-free full-length transcripts and broken chromosomes. Therefore, transcription fidelity may compromise genomic integrity.","64":"High-speed single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo shows that transcription factors in eukaryotes can act in oligomeric clusters mediated by molecular crowding and intrinsically disordered protein. This finding impacts on the longstanding puzzle of how transcription factors find their gene targets so efficiently in the complex, heterogeneous environment of the cell. Abbreviations CDF - cumulative distribution function; FRAP - fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP - Green fluorescent protein; STORM - stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy; TF - Transcription factor; YFP - Yellow fluorescent protein.","65":"Promoters with enhancer activity have been described recently. In this point of view, we will discuss current findings highlighting the commonality of this type of regulatory elements, their genetic and epigenetic characteristics, their potential biological roles in the regulation of gene expression and the underlining molecular mechanisms.

","66":"The genetic code sectored via tRNA charging errors, and the code progressed toward closure and universality because of evolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) fidelity and translational fidelity mechanisms. Class I and class II aaRS folds are identified as homologs. From sequence alignments, a structurally conserved Zn-binding domain common to class I and class II aaRS was identified. A model for the class I and class II aaRS alternate folding pathways is posited. Five mechanisms toward code closure are highlighted: 1) aaRS proofreading to remove mischarged amino acids from tRNA; 2) accurate aaRS active site specification of amino acid substrates; 3) aaRS-tRNA anticodon recognition; 4) conformational coupling proofreading of the anticodon-codon interaction; and 5) deamination of tRNA wobble adenine to inosine. In tRNA anticodons there is strong wobble sequence preference that results in a broader spectrum of contacts to synonymous mRNA codon wobble bases. Adenine is excluded from the anticodon wobble position of tRNA unless it is modified to inosine. Uracil is generally preferred to cytosine in the tRNA anticodon wobble position. Because of wobble ambiguity when tRNA reads mRNA, the maximal coding capacity of the three nucleotide code read by tRNA is 31 amino acids + stops.","67":"Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is accomplished with the aid of numerous accessory factors specific to each transcriptional stage. The structure of the Pol II elongation complex (EC) bound with Spt4\/5, Elf1, and TFIIS unveiled the sophisticated basal EC architecture essential for transcription elongation and other transcription-related events.","68":"Recently, it was found that bacterial and eukaryotic transcripts are capped with cellular cofactors installed by their respective RNA polymerases (RNAPs) during transcription initiation. We now show that mitochondrial RNAP efficiently caps transcripts with ADP - containing cofactors. However, a functional role of universal RNAP - catalysed capping is not yet clear.","69":"Zinc-finger and homeodomain transcription factors have been shown in vitro to bind to recognition motifs containing a methylated CpG. However, accessing these motifs in vivo might be seriously impeded by the inclusion of DNA in nucleosomes and by the condensed structure adopted by chromatin formed on methylated DNA. Here, we discuss how oxidation of 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine could provide the initial destabilizing clue for such transcription factors to get access to nucleosomal DNA and read epigenetic information.","70":null,"71":"In yeast, transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is regulated by unique mechanisms acting at the level of the enzyme. Under stress situations such as starvation, Pol I hibernates through dimerization. When growth conditions are restored, dimer disassembly and Rrn3 binding drive enzyme activation and subsequent recruitment to rDNA.","72":"Hexim1 acts as a tumor suppressor and is involved in the regulation of innate immunity. It was initially described as a non-coding RNA-dependent regulator of transcription. Here, we detail how 7SK RNA binds to Hexim1 and turns it into an inhibitor of the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). In addition to its action on P-TEFb, it plays a role in a variety of different mechanisms: it controls the stability of transcription factor components and assists binding of transcription factors to their targets.","73":"While structures of the RNA polymerase (Pol) II initiation complex have been resolved and extensively studied, the Pol I initiation complex remained elusive. Here, we review the recent structural analyses of the yeast Pol I transcription initiation complex that reveal several unique and unexpected Pol I-specific properties.","74":"Recently, we reported that a major function of histone acetylation at the yeast FLO1 gene was to regulate transcription elongation. Here, we discuss possible mechanisms by which histone acetylation might regulate RNA polymerase II processivity, and comment on the contribution to transcription of chromatin remodelling at gene coding regions and promoters.","75":"There are hundreds of copies of rDNA repeats in mammalian chromosomes and the ratio of active, poised, or inactive rDNA is regulated in epigenetic manners. Recent studies demonstrated that a post-DNA replication repair enzyme, SHPRH affects rRNA transcription by recognizing epigenetic markers on rDNA promoters and unveiled potential links between DNA repair and ribosome biogenesis. This study suggests that SHPRH could be a link between mTOR-mediated epigenetic regulations and rRNA transcription, while concomitantly affecting genomic integrity.","76":"The role of transcription factors (TFs) on nucleosome positioning, RNA polymerase recruitment, and transcription initiation has been extensively characterized. Here, we propose that a subset of TFs such as Reb1, Abf1, Rap1, and TFIIIB also serve a major function in partitioning transcription units by assisting the Nrd1p-Nab3p-Sen1p Pol II termination pathway.","77":"Gene transcriptional regulation relies on cis-regulatory DNA modules (CRMs), which serve as nexus sites for integration of multiple transcription factor (TF) activities. Here, we provide evidence and discuss recent literature indicating that TF recruitment to CRMs is organized into combinations of trans-regulatory protein modules (TRMs). We propose that TRMs are functional entities composed of TFs displaying the most highly interdependent chromatin binding which are, in addition, able to modulate their recruitment to CRMs through inter-TRM effects. These findings shed light on the architectural organization of TF recruitment encoded by their recognition motifs within CRMs.","78":"Transcription of DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP) takes place in a cell environment dominated by thermal fluctuations. How are transcription reactions including initiation, elongation, and termination on genomic DNA so well-controlled during such fluctuations? A recent statistical mechanical approach using high-throughput sequencing data reveals that repetitive DNA sequence elements embedded into a genomic sequence provide the key mechanism to functionally bias the fluctuations of transcription elongation complexes. In particular, during elongation pausing, such repetitive sequence elements can increase the magnitude of one-dimensional diffusion of the RNAP enzyme on the DNA upstream of the pausing site, generating a large variation in the dwell times of RNAP pausing under the control of these genomic signals.","79":"Recent large-scale RNA sequencing efforts have revealed the extensive diversity of mRNA molecules produced from most eukaryotic coding genes, which arises from the usage of alternative, cryptic or non-canonical splicing and intronic polyadenylation sites. The prevailing view regarding the tremendous diversity of coding gene transcripts is that mRNA processing is a flexible and more-or-less noisy process leading to a diversity of proteins on which natural selection can act depending on protein-mediated cellular functions. However, this concept raises two main questions. First, do alternative mRNA processing pathways have a role other than generating mRNA and protein diversity? Second, is the cellular function of mRNA variants restricted to the biogenesis of functional protein isoforms? Here, I propose that the co-transcriptional use of alternative mRNA processing sites allows first, the resolution of co-transcriptional biophysical constraints that may otherwise result in DNA instability, and second, increases the diversity of cellular functions of mRNAs in a manner that is not restricted to protein synthesis.","80":null,"81":"Cell type-specific and housekeeping enhancers and promoters collectively control the transcriptional output of mammalian cells. Recent data clarify how DNA sequence features on the one hand control functional coupling of promoters with selected enhancers, and on the other impart high level of activity to a broad range of regulatory elements.","82":"Single molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) enables gene transcription to be assessed at the cellular level. In this point of view article, we describe our recent smFISH research in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and discuss how this technique could further knowledge of plant gene transcription in the future.","83":"Significant attention has recently been given to a class of enhancers termed \"super enhancers\", while implying that \"typical enhancers\" are less important. In this report, we examine criteria for identification of super enhancers and address the need to evaluate the differences between BRD4-occupied \"typical\" and \"super\" enhancers.","84":"Most RNA polymerases can initiate transcription from diverse DNA template sequences with relatively few outright sequence restraints. Recent reports have demonstrated that failure to subdue the promiscuity of RNA polymerase in vivo can severely impede cell function. This phenomenon appears common to all cell types with undesirable effects ranging from growth inhibition in prokaryotes to cancer in higher organisms. Here we discuss similarities and differences in strategies employed by cells to minimise spurious transcription across life's domains.","85":"Autophagy is an essential cellular process that degrades cytoplasmic organelles and components. Precise control of autophagic activity is achieved by context-dependent signaling pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of transcriptional programs during autophagic responses to various signals. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the transcriptional regulation of autophagy.","86":null,"87":"The ability of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to regulate the nucleosome barrier is poorly understood because we do not know enough about the involved factors and we lack a conceptual framework to model this process. Our group recently identified the conserved Fun30\/SMARCAD1 family chromatin-remodeling factor, Fun30Fft3, as being critical for relieving the nucleosome barrier during RNAPII-mediated elongation, and proposed a model illustrating how Fun30Fft3 may contribute to nucleosome disassembly during RNAPII-mediated elongation. Here, we present a model that describes nucleosome dynamics during RNAPII-mediated elongation in mathematical terms and addresses the involvement of Fun30Fft3 in this process.","88":"Transcription of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotic cells is a dynamically coordinated process. Many of the key transcription regulators contain functionally essential intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), the dynamic nature of which creates extra challenges to traditional biochemical analyses. Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence imaging technology have enabled direct visualization of these rapid, complex and dynamic molecular interactions in real time.","89":"Helicases are enzymes that remodel nucleic acids or protein-nucleic acid complexes in an ATP-dependent manner. They are ubiquitous and can play many diverse functions related to the metabolism of nucleic acids. A few helicases from both the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic worlds have the ability to induce transcription termination. Here we discuss how the same biological function is achieved by different helicases with quite divergent structures and mechanisms of action.","90":"Characterisation of the Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation complex revealed an assembly of a conserved set of transcript elongation factors associated with chromatin remodellers, histone modifiers as well as with various pre-mRNA splicing and polyadenylation factors. Therefore, transcribing RNAPII streamlines the processes of mRNA synthesis and processing in plants.","91":"Here, we discuss the role of Brf2, an RNA Polymerase III core transcription factor, as a master switch of the oxidative stress response. We highlight the interplay of Brf2 with the Nrf2\/Keap1 pathway, as well as the role of Brf2 in cancer and other possible regulations.","92":null,"93":"Sub1 was initially identified as a coactivator factor with a role during transcription initiation. However, over the last years, many evidences showed that it influences processes downstream during mRNA biogenesis, such as elongation, termination, and RNAPII phosphorylation. The recent discover that Sub1 directly interacts with the RNAPII stalk adds new insights into how it achieves all these tasks.","94":"Transcription of eukaryotic genes requires the cooperative action of the RNA polymerase complex, the general transcription factors (TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH) and chromatin modifiers. The TFIID complex contributes to transcriptional activation by several mechanisms and has a subunit with associated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. The histone modifier SAGA complex has both HAT and deubiquitylase (DUB) activities. TFIID and SAGA share several TBP-associated factors (TAFs), but not their HAT subunit. Recently, several duplicated TAF proteins have been identified in higher eukaryotes, but their functional diversity has been so far poorly characterized. Here, we report the functional similarities and differences of TAF10 and TAF10b, the two TAF10 orthologs of Drosophila melanogaster. Results from in silico modeling suggest that dTAF10 and dTAF10b have similar secondary structures characterized by the presence of a histone-fold domain. Additionally, dTAF10 and dTAF10b share interaction partners and show similar expression patterns in neuronal tissues. Nonetheless, dTAF10 and dTAF10b seem to have partly distinct functions. To investigate their roles, we generated dTaf10-dTaf10b double-mutants and rescued the mutant flies with transgenes, which allowed the translation of either dTAF10 or dTAF10b protein. We found that the loss of dTAF10b resulted in pupal lethality, while animals lacking dTAF10 were able to form puparium. dTaf10 mutant adults showed distorted eye morphology. During DNA repair, dTAF10 and dTAF10b act redundantly, suggesting that these proteins have distinct but partially overlapping functions.","95":"In vitro studies of mitochondrial transcription often use linear templates that fail to replicate key features of transcription on a circular genome. We developed a plasmid-based system for the analysis of heavy-strand promoters that recapitulates key features of native mtDNA to study topological and protein requirements of promoter activation. The heavy-strand promoters (HSP1 and HSP2) are simultaneously active on a circular template. HSP2 requires supercoiling for maximal activation. Increasing TFAM concentrations suppress HSP2 at levels that result in HSP1 stimulation. This study shows distinct modes of promoter activation, providing opportunities for the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression by promoter selection.","96":"Mediator is a multisubunit complex conserved in eukaryotes that plays an essential coregulator role in RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. Despite intensive studies of the Mediator complex, the molecular mechanisms of its function in vivo remain to be fully defined. In this review, we will discuss the different aspects of Mediator function starting with its interactions with specific transcription factors, its recruitment to chromatin and how, as a coregulator, it contributes to the assembly of transcription machinery components within the preinitiation complex (PIC) in vivo and beyond the PIC formation.","97":"The 7SK small nuclear RNA is a multifunctional transcriptional regulatory RNA that controls the nuclear activity of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), specifically targets P-TEFb to the promoter regions of selected protein-coding genes and promotes transcription of RNA polymerase II-specific spliceosomal small nuclear RNA genes.","98":"To prevent tumorigenesis, p53 stimulates transcription by facilitating the recruitment of the transcription machinery on target gene promoters. Cryo-Electron Microscopy studies on p53-bound RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) reveal that p53 structurally regulates Pol II to affect its DNA binding and elongation, providing new insights into p53-mediated transcriptional regulation.","99":null,"100":"TFIIH is a 10-subunit complex involved in transcription and DNA repair. It contains several enzymatic activities including a ATP-dependent DNA translocase in XPB and a cyclin-dependent kinase in CDK7. Recently the discovery of several XPB and CDK7 inhibitors with specific impact on the transcriptional addiction of many tumors pinpointed these activities as potential target in cancer chemotherapy. Unexpectedly a basal transcription factor involved in global mRNA expression now emerges a one of the most clinically promising Achilles heels of cancerous cells. These inhibitors also proved to be useful tools to unveil new functions of TFIIH in gene expression.","101":"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit consists of a unique repeated heptad sequence of the consensus Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. An important function of the CTD is to couple transcription with RNA processing reactions that occur during the initiation, elongation, and termination phases of transcription. During this transcription cycle, the CTD is subject to extensive modification, primarily phosphorylation, on its non-proline residues. Reversible phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 is well known to play important and general functions during transcription in all eukaryotes. More recent studies have enhanced our understanding of Tyr1, Thr4, and Ser7, and what have been previously characterized as unknown or specialized functions for these residues has changed to a more fine-detailed map of transcriptional regulation that highlights similarities as well as significant differences between organisms. Here, we review recent findings on the function and modification of these three residues, which further illustrate the importance of the CTD in precisely modulating gene expression.","102":null,"103":"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been associated with the lack of three hormone receptors; estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). However, a host of other steroid hormone receptors such as vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in TNBC, and the role of these hormone receptors in breast tumorigenesis is unclear. The levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) are also expressed differently than in normal mammary epithelial cells. miRNAs are regulatory RNAs involved in various cellular functions, mainly gene silencing. Here, we reviewed the literature surrounding miRNAs in breast cancer, and performed in silico analysis to determine whether there was a correlation between levels of VDR in relation to miRNAs important in breast cancer development and tumorigenesis. We identified three miRNAs of interest, specifically, miR-23, miR-124, and miR-125. Through this research we determined the possibility that these miRNAs play an important role in controlling VDR activity and by virtue the development of breast cancer.","104":"Transcription elongation is not uniform and transcription is often hindered by protein-bound factors or DNA lesions that limit translocation and impair catalysis. Despite the high degree of sequence and structural homology of the multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAP), substantial differences in response to DNA lesions have been reported. Archaea encode only a single RNAP with striking structural conservation with eukaryotic RNAP II (Pol II). Here, we demonstrate that the archaeal RNAP from Thermococcus kodakarensis is sensitive to a variety of DNA lesions that pause and arrest RNAP at or adjacent to the site of DNA damage. DNA damage only halts elongation when present in the template strand, and the damage often results in RNAP arresting such that the lesion would be encapsulated with the transcription elongation complex. The strand-specific halt to archaeal transcription elongation on modified templates is supportive of RNAP recognizing DNA damage and potentially initiating DNA repair through a process akin to the well-described transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) pathways in Bacteria and Eukarya.","105":"In the United States, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men with an approximately 220,000 patients diagnosed with the disease in 2015. Prostate cancer is a hormone-driven tumor, and a common therapy is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) that involves anti-androgen treatments and\/or castration therapy. Understanding the molecular basis for androgen-independent tumors is crucial toward developing new therapies for these patients. Understanding how androgen receptor itself functions is an important step in elucidating this process. Androgen receptor (AR), NR3C4, is a nuclear hormone receptor and functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the expression of protein-coding genes. Translocation of AR to improper gene promoter elements or DNA-binding sites can result in an alteration in gene expression and thus normal prostate function. Therefore, it is crucial to understand which AR-promoter interactions are drivers of disease, as compared to promiscuous or benign AR-binding interactions. While a large portion of our genome is considered a gene desert, it is now appreciated that these regions of the genome contain non-coding RNA genes such as microRNAs (miRNAs). These non-coding RNAs have enormous regulatory potential, as they post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to promote degradation or intervention of translational processes. In this review, we focus specifically on the notion that mis-regulation of non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs by improper AR-DNA binding are an important component that promotes prostate cancer. We also highlight the role of miR-206 and the interaction of miR-206 and AR within this process, given this is a miRNA known to be regulated by hormones in both breast and prostate cancer.","106":"Type 3 RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoters are widely used for the expression of small RNAs such as short hairpin RNA and guide RNA in the popular RNAi and CRISPR-Cas gene regulation systems. Although it is generally believed that type 3 Pol III promoters use a defined transcription start site (+1 position), most man-made promoter constructs contain local sequence alterations of which the impact on transcription efficiency and initiation accuracy is not known. For three human type 3 Pol III promoters (7SK, U6, and H1), we demonstrated that the nucleotides around the +1 position affect both the transcriptional efficiency and start site selection. Human 7SK and U6 promoters with A or G at the +1 position efficiently produced small RNAs with a precise +1 start site. The human H1 promoter with +1A or G also efficiently produced small RNAs but from multiple start sites in the -3\/-1 window. These results provide new insights for the design of vectors for accurate expression of designed small RNAs for research and therapeutic purposes.","107":"Gene regulation is fundamentally important for the coordination of diverse biologic processes including homeostasis and responses to developmental and environmental stimuli. Transcription factor (TF) binding sites are one of the major functional subunits of gene regulation. They are arranged in cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that can be more active than the sum of their individual effects. Recently, we described a mechanism of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced gene regulation in which the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds coordinately to multiple CRMs that are 10s of kilobases apart in the genome. In those results, the minority of GR binding sites appear to involve direct TF:DNA interactions. Meanwhile, other GR binding sites in a cluster interact with those direct binding sites to tune their gene regulatory activity. Here, we consider the implications of those and related results in the context of existing models of gene regulation. Based on our analyses, we propose that the billboard and regulatory grammar models of cis-regulatory element activity be expanded to consider the influence of long-range interactions between cis-regulatory modules.","108":"Transcriptional control is critical in relaying signals mediated by Ras and Rho family small GTPases to effect gene expression. In the classical model, signaling components such as MAP kinase target sequence-specific transcription factors, which in turn recruit RNA polymerase (Pol) II holoenzyme to the promoter and activate transcription. Findings in recent years have led to the proposal of a shortcut model in which the Mediator components of the Pol II holoenzyme are regulated by signaling pathways. A very recent finding shows that an evolutionarily conserved Rho GTPase signaling pathway can directly modulate the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation by inhibiting the CTD phosphatase in yeast and Arabidopsis. This shortcut model allows direct targeting of the Pol II CTD code and thus has an advantage over the classical model in bringing about rapid, large-scale changes in gene expression.","109":"Recently, we reported the unexpected finding that the monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2Bub1) regulates inducible enhancers. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to reconcile the apparently discrepant roles of H2Bub1 in transcription initiation and elongation, and we discuss how H2Bub1 could regulate cellular processes linked to non-coding transcription.","110":"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a group of more than 200 co-regulated genes (Ribi genes) is involved in ribosome biogenesis. This regulon has recently been shown to rely on a small set of transcriptional regulators (mainly Abf1, but also Reb1, Tbf1 and Rap1) previously referred to as general regulatory factors (GRFs) because of their widespread binding and action at many promoters and other specialized genomic regions. Intriguingly, Abf1 binding to Ribi genes is differentially modulated in response to distinct nutrition signaling pathways. Such a dynamic promoter association has the potential to orchestrate both activation and repression of Ribi genes in synergy with neighboring regulatory sites and through the functional interplay of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases.","111":"Transcription factors (TFs) are among the most frequently detected targets of sumoylation, and effects of the modification have been studied for about 200 individual TFs to date. TF sumoylation is most often associated with reduced target gene expression, which can be mediated by enhanced interactions with corepressors or by interference with protein modifications that promote transcription. However, recent studies show that sumoylation also regulates gene expression by controlling the levels of TFs that are associated with chromatin. SUMO can mediate this by modulating TF DNA-binding activity, promoting clearance of TFs from chromatin, or indirectly, by influencing TF abundance or localization.","112":"Early work on the control of transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) laid the foundation for our current knowledge of how RNA Polymerase II is released from promoter-proximal pausing sites and transcription elongation is enhanced. The viral Tat activator recruits Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) and Super Elongation Complex (SEC) that jointly drive transcription elongation. While substantial progress in understanding the role of SEC in HIV gene transcription elongation has been obtained, defining of the mechanisms that govern SEC functions is still limited, and the role of SEC in controlling HIV transcription in the absence of Tat is less clear. Here we revisit the contribution of SEC in early steps of HIV gene transcription. In the absence of Tat, the AF4\/FMR2 Family member 4 (AFF4) of SEC efficiently activates HIV transcription, while gene activation by its homolog AFF1 is substantially lower. Differential recruitment to the HIV promoter and association with Human Polymerase-Associated Factor complex (PAFc) play key role in this functional distinction between AFF4 and AFF1. Moreover, while depletion of cyclin T1 expression has subtle effects on HIV gene transcription in the absence of Tat, knockout (KO) of AFF1, AFF4, or both proteins slightly repress this early step of viral transcription. Upon Tat expression, HIV transcription reaches optimal levels despite KO of AFF1 or AFF4 expression. However, double AFF1\/AFF4 KO completely diminishes Tat trans-activation. Significantly, our results show that P-TEFb phosphorylates AFF4 and modulates SEC assembly, AFF1\/4 dimerization and recruitment to the viral promoter. We conclude that SEC promotes both early steps of HIV transcription in the absence of Tat, as well as elongation of transcription, when Tat is expressed. Significantly, SEC functions are modulated by P-TEFb.","113":"Transcription factors TBP and TF(II)B assemble with RNA polymerase at the promoter DNA forming the initiation complex. Despite a high degree of conservation, the molecular binding mechanisms of archaeal and eukaryotic TBP and TF(II)B differ significantly. Based on recent biophysical data, we speculate how the mechanisms co-evolved with transcription regulation and TBP multiplicity.","114":null,"115":"Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) is a family of nine proteins catalyzing the methylation of arginine residues. They were recently shown to be essential for proper regeneration of skeletal muscles. However, the mechanisms triggering the methylation event, as well as how the methylated substrates regulate muscle stem cell function and fate decision remain to be determined. This point-of-view will discuss the recent findings on the specific role of PRMT1, CARM1\/PRMT4, PRMT5, and PRMT7 in muscle stem cell fate guidance, and shed light on the future challenges which could help defining the therapeutic potential of PRMT inhibitors against muscular disorders and aging.","116":"Pioneer transcription factors are defined by their ability to bind nucleosome-occupied regions. Here, we discuss the properties of nucleosomes bound by pioneers at enhancer regions. We describe how select pioneers bind nucleosome-occupied or -depleted enhancer sites. Importantly, by revisiting and expanding existing data sets, we show differential H2A.Z and p300\/CBP association at bound enhancers, highlighting two possible pioneering modes.","117":"Drosophila genetic studies demonstrate that cell and tissue growth regulation is a primary developmental function of P-element somatic inhibitor (Psi), the sole ortholog of FUBP family RNA\/DNA-binding proteins. Psi achieves growth control through interaction with Mediator, observations that should put to rest controversy surrounding Pol II transcriptional functions for these KH domain proteins.","118":"The ETS family of transcription factors is a functionally heterogeneous group of gene regulators that share a structurally conserved, eponymous DNA-binding domain. DNA target specificity derives from combinatorial interactions with other proteins as well as intrinsic heterogeneity among ETS domains. Emerging evidence suggests molecular hydration as a fundamental feature that defines the intrinsic heterogeneity in DNA target selection and susceptibility to epigenetic DNA modification. This perspective invokes novel hypotheses in the regulation of ETS proteins in physiologic osmotic stress, their pioneering potential in heterochromatin, and the effects of passive and pharmacologic DNA demethylation on ETS regulation.","119":"Mediator is a conserved and essential coactivator complex broadly required for RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription. Recent genome-wide studies of Mediator binding in budding yeast have revealed new insights into the functions of this critical complex and raised new questions about its role in the regulation of gene expression.","120":"This review is focused on recent progress in understanding how Escherichia coli RNAP polymerase translocates along the DNA template and the factors that affect this movement. We discuss the fundamental aspects of RNAP translocation, template signals that influence forward or backward movement, and host or phage factors that modulate translocation.","121":"Despite recent advances in structural analysis, it is still challenging to obtain a high-resolution structure for a complex of RNA polymerase, transcriptional factors, and DNA. However, using biochemical constraints, 3D printed models of available structures, and computer modeling, one can build biologically relevant models of such supramolecular complexes.","122":"Transcriptional interference (TI) is increasingly recognized as a widespread mechanism of gene control, particularly given the pervasive nature of transcription, both sense and antisense, across all kingdoms of life. Here, we discuss how transcription factor binding kinetics strongly influence the ability of a transcription factor to relieve or induce TI.","123":null,"124":"The release of a paused Pol II depends on the recruitment of P-TEFb. Recent studies showed that both active P-TEFb and inactive P-TEFb (7SK snRNP) can be recruited to the promoter regions of global genes by different mechanisms. Here, we summarize the recent advances on these distinct recruitment mechanisms.","125":"Pausing by RNA polymerase is a major mechanism that regulates transcription elongation but can cause conflicts with fellow RNA polymerases and other cellular machineries. Here, we summarize our recent finding that misincorporation could be a major source of transcription pausing in vivo, and discuss the role of misincorporation-induced pausing.","126":"SIRT7, a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, is a key mediator of many cellular activities. SIRT7 expression is linked to cell proliferation and oncogenic activity, connecting SIRT7-dependent regulation of ribosome biogenesis with checkpoints controlling cell cycle progression, metabolic homeostasis, stress resistance, aging and tumorigenesis. Despite this important functional link, the enzymatic activity, the molecular targets and physiological functions of SIRT7 are poorly defined. Here, we review recent progress in SIRT7 research and elaborate the main pathways in which SIRT7 participates.","127":"RBPJ is the central transcription factor that controls the Notch-dependent transcriptional response by coordinating repressing histone H3K27 deacetylation and activating histone H3K4 methylation. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms how RBPJ interacts with opposing NCoR\/HDAC-corepressing or KMT2D\/UTX-coactivating complexes and how this is controlled by phosphorylation of chromatin modifiers.","128":"Transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) II is regulated at multiple steps by phosphorylation, catalyzed mainly by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family. The CDKs involved in transcription have overlapping substrate specificities, but play largely non-redundant roles in coordinating gene expression. Novel functions and targets of CDKs have recently emerged at the end of the transcription cycle, when the primary transcript is cleaved, and in most cases polyadenylated, and transcription is terminated by the action of the \"torpedo\" exonuclease Xrn2, which is a CDK substrate. Collectively, various functions have been ascribed to CDKs or CDK-mediated phosphorylation: recruiting cleavage and polyadenylation factors, preventing premature termination within gene bodies while promoting efficient termination of full-length transcripts, and preventing extensive readthrough transcription into intergenic regions or neighboring genes. The assignment of precise functions to specific CDKs is still in progress, but recent advances suggest ways in which the CDK network and RNAP II machinery might cooperate to ensure timely exit from the transcription cycle.","129":"The functional capacity of cells is defined by the transcriptome. Many recent studies have identified variations in the transcriptome of tumors due to alternative splicing changes, as well as mutations in splicing factors and regulatory signals in most tumor types. Some of these alterations have been linked to tumor progression, metastasis, therapy resistance, and other oncogenic processes. Here, we describe the different mechanisms that drive splicing changes in tumors and their impact in cancer. Motivated by the current evidence, we propose a model whereby a subset of the splicing patterns contributes to the definition of specific tumor phenotypes, and may hold potential for the development of novel clinical biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.","130":null,"131":"Cellular adaptation response to a myriad of stressors is key for survival. The lysosomal\/autophagy pathway is inextricably connected to the stress response regulation. Two transcription factors, TFEB and TFE3, have recently emerged as master regulators of this degradative pathway. Their function modulating different cellular pathways will be discussed.","132":"We give an overview of experimental and computational methods to estimate RNA metabolism rates genome-wide. We then advocate a local definition of RNA metabolism rate at the level of individual phosphodiester bonds. Rates of formation and disappearance of individual bonds are unambiguously defined, in contrast to rates of complete transcripts. We show that over previous approaches, the recently developed transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) protocol allows for estimation of metabolism rates of individual bonds with least positional bias.","133":"Enhancers control development and cellular function by spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. Co-occurrence of acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and mono methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) has been widely used for identification of active enhancers. However, increasing evidence suggests that using this combination of marks alone for enhancer identification gives an incomplete picture of the active enhancer repertoire. We have shown that the H3 globular domain acetylations, H3K64ac and H3K122ac, and an H4 tail acetylation, H4K16ac, are enriched at active enhancers together with H3K27ac, and also at a large number of enhancers without detectable H3K27ac. We propose that acetylations at these lysine residues of histones H3 and H4 might function by directly affecting chromatin structure, nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, nucleosome stability, and transcription factor accessibility.","134":"Epigenetic marks determine cell fate via numerous reader proteins. H3K36 methylation is a common epigenetic mark that is thought to be associated with the activities of the RNA polymerase 2 C-terminal domain. We discuss a novel silencing mechanism regulated by Set2-dependent H3K36 methylation that involves exosome-dependent RNA processing.","135":"It is widely accepted that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor that triggers anti-inflammatory responses, binds specific response elements as a homodimer. Here, we will discuss the original primary data that established this model and contrast it with a recent report characterizing the GR-DNA complex as a tetramer.","136":"Recent research reveals that the YEATS domains preferentially recognize crotonylated lysines on histones. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that enable this recognition and the biological significances of this interaction. The dynamics of histone crotonylation and its potential roles in the regulation of gene expression will also be discussed.","137":"During transcription, RNA polymerase moves downstream along the DNA template and maintains a transcription bubble. Several recent structural studies of transcription complexes with a complete transcription bubble provide new insights into how RNAP couples the nucleotide addition reaction to its directional movement.","138":"Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the capacity of cancer cells to adapt to the tumor microenvironment and to anticancer therapies is a major challenge. In this context, cancer is believed to be an evolutionary process where random mutations and the selection process shape the mutational pattern and phenotype of cancer cells. This article challenges the notion of randomness of some cancer-associated mutations by describing molecular mechanisms involving stress-mediated biogenesis of mRNA-derived small RNAs able to target and increase the local mutation rate of the genomic loci they originate from. It is proposed that the probability of some mutations at specific loci could be increased in a stress-specific and RNA-depending manner. This would increase the probability of generating mutations that could alleviate stress situations, such as those triggered by anticancer drugs. Such a mechanism is made possible because tumor- and anticancer drug-associated stress situations trigger both cellular reprogramming and inflammation, which leads cancer cells to express molecular tools allowing them to \"attack\" and mutate their own genome in an RNA-directed manner.","139":null,"140":"G-quadruplexes are non-canonical DNA secondary structures involved in several genomic and molecular processes. Here, we summarize the main G-quadruplex features and evidences proving the in vivo role on the transcriptional regulation of genes required for zebrafish embryonic development. We also discuss alternative strategies for specifically interfering G-quadruplex in vivo.","141":"The structures of RNA Polymerase (Pol) II pre-initiation complexes (PIC) have recently been determined at near-atomic resolution, elucidating unprecedented mechanistic details of promoter opening during transcription initiation. The key structural features of promoter opening are summarized here. Structural knowledge of Pol I and III PIC is also briefly discussed.","142":null,"143":"Transcription factors generally regulate gene expression of multiple targets. In contrast, our recent finding suggests that the zinc finger protein Ouija board controls steroid hormone biosynthesis through specific regulation of only one gene spookier in Drosophila. It sheds light on a specialized but essential factor that evolved for one target.","144":"Cellular transcriptional programs driven by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms could be better understood by integrating \"omics\" data and subsequently modeling the gene-regulatory events. Toward this end, computational biology should keep pace with evolving experimental procedures and data availability. This article gives an exemplified account of the current computational challenges in molecular biology.","145":"Eukaryotic genomic DNA contains numerous high-affinity sites for transcription factors. Only a small fraction of these sites directly regulates target genes. Other high-affinity sites can serve as naturally present decoys that sequester transcription factors. Such natural decoys in genomic DNA may provide novel regulatory mechanisms for transcription factors.","146":"In nature, stress is typically chronic or recurring and stress exposure can prime modified responses to recurring stress. Such stress priming may occur at the level of transcription. Here, we discuss the connection between plant stress memory, transcription, and chromatin modifications using the example of recurring heat stress.","147":"Hybridization of RNA to its template DNA strand during transcription induces formation of R-loops-RNA:DNA hybrids with unpaired non-template DNA strands. Although unresolved R-loops can be detrimental, some R-loops contribute to regulation of chromatin structure. Consequently, R-loops help regulate gene expression and play important roles in numerous cellular processes.","148":"Here, we discuss the overall architecture of the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and III (Pol III) core enzymes and their associated general transcription factors in the context of models of the Pol I and Pol III pre-initiation complexes, thereby highlighting potential functional adaptations of the Pol I and Pol III enzymes to their respective transcription tasks. Several new insights demonstrate the great degree of specialization of each of the eukaryotic RNA polymerases that is only beginning to be revealed as the structural and functional characterization of all eukaryotic RNA polymerases and their pre-initiation complexes progresses.","149":"Super elongation complex (SEC) belongs to a family of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation factors that has similar properties as TFIIF, a general transcription factor that increases the transcription elongation rate by reducing pausing. Although SEC has TFIIF-like functional properties, it apparently lacks sequence and structural homology. Using HHpred, we find that SEC contains an evolutionarily related TFIIF-like subcomplex. We show that the SEC subunit ELL interacts with the Pol II Rbp2 subunit, as expected for a TFIIF-like factor. These findings suggest a new model for how SEC functions as a Pol II elongation factor and how it suppresses Pol II pausing.","150":"The multi-functional TET (TAF15\/EWS\/TLS) or FET (FUS\/EWS\/TLS) protein family of higher organisms harbor a transcriptional-activation domain (EAD) and an RNA-binding domain (RBD). The transcriptional activation function is, however, only revealed in oncogenic TET-fusion proteins because in native TET proteins it is auto-repressed by RGG-boxes within the TET RBD. Auto-repression is suggested to involve direct cation-pi interactions between multiple Arg residues within RGG boxes and EAD aromatics. Via analysis of TET transcriptional activity in different organisms, we report herein that repression is not autonomous but instead requires additional trans-acting factors. This finding is not supportive of a proposed model whereby repression occurs via a simple intramolecular EAD\/RGG-box interaction. We also show that RGG-boxes present within reiterated YGGDRGG repeats that are unique to TAF15, are defective for repression due to the conserved Asp residue. Thus, RGG boxes within TET proteins can be functionally distinguished. While our results show that YGGDRGG repeats are not involved in TAF15 auto-repression, their remarkable number and conservation strongly suggest that they may confer specialized properties to TAF15 and thus contribute to functional differentiation within the TET\/FET protein family.","151":"Transcription termination is mechanistically coupled to pre-mRNA 3' end formation to prevent transcription much beyond the gene 3' end. C. elegans, however, engages in polycistronic transcription of operons in which 3' end formation between genes is not accompanied by termination. We have performed RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and CstF ChIP-seq experiments to investigate at a genome-wide level how RNAPII can transcribe through multiple poly-A signals without causing termination. Our data shows that transcription proceeds in some ways as if operons were composed of multiple adjacent single genes. Total RNAPII shows a small peak at the promoter of the gene cluster and a much larger peak at 3' ends. These 3' peaks coincide with maximal phosphorylation of Ser2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII and maximal localization of the 3' end formation factor CstF. This pattern occurs at all 3' ends including those at internal sites in operons where termination does not occur. Thus the normal mechanism of 3' end formation does not always result in transcription termination. Furthermore, reduction of CstF50 by RNAi did not substantially alter the pattern of CstF64, total RNAPII, or Ser2 phosphorylation at either internal or terminal 3' ends. However, CstF50 RNAi did result in a subtle reduction of CstF64 binding upstream of the site of 3' cleavage, suggesting that the CstF50\/CTD interaction may facilitate bringing the 3' end machinery to the transcription complex.","152":"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription through chromatin is accompanied by formation of small intranucleosomal DNA loops. Pol II captured within a small loop drives accumulation of DNA supercoiling, facilitating further transcription.

Transcription of heat shock genes, serum-induced immediate early genes and nuclear receptor-activated genes, each required DNA double strands generated by topoisomerase IIb. Such strand breaks seemed both necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation. In addition, such transcription was associated with initiation of the DNA damage response pathways, including the activation of the enzymes: ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1. DNA damage response signaling was involved both in transcription and in repair of DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase IIb.","156":"RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) synthesizes diverse, small, non-coding RNAs with many important roles in the cellular metabolism.

K7ac, K7me2, and K7me3 were found exclusively associated with phosphorylated CTD peptides, while K7me1 occurred also in non-phosphorylated CTD. The monoclonal antibody 1F5 recognizes K7me1\/2 residues in CTD and reacts with RNAPIIA. Treatment of cellular extracts with phosphatase or of cells with the kinase inhibitor flavopiridol unmasked the K7me1\/2 epitope in RNAPII0, consistent with the association of K7me1\/2 marks with phosphorylated CTD peptides. Genome-wide profiling revealed high levels of K7me1\/2 marks at the transcriptional start site of genes for sense and antisense transcribing RNAPII.

","170":"CTCF is a versatile transcription factor with well-established roles in chromatin organization and insulator function. Recent findings also implicate CTCF in the control of elongation by RNA polymerase (RNAP) II. Here we show that CTCF knockdown abrogates RNAP II pausing at the early elongation checkpoint of c-myc by affecting recruitment of DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF). CTCF knockdown also causes a termination defect on the U2 snRNA genes (U2), by affecting recruitment of negative elongation factor (NELF). In addition, CTCF is required for recruitment of positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which phosphorylates NELF, DSIF, and Ser2 of the RNAP II CTD to activate elongation of transcription of c-myc and recognition of the snRNA gene-specific 3' box RNA processing signal. These findings implicate CTCF in a complex network of protein:protein\/protein:DNA interactions and assign a key role to CTCF in controlling RNAP II transcription through the elongation checkpoint of the protein-coding c-myc and the termination site of the non-coding U2, by regulating the recruitment and\/or activity of key players in these processes.

We extensively characterize this TL substitution for each of these reactions by examining the responses RNAP II enzymes to catalytic metals, altered pH, and factor inputs. We demonstrate that TFIIF stimulation of the first phosphodiester bond formation by RNAP II requires wild type TL function and that H1085Y substitution within the TL compromises or alters RNAP II responsiveness to both TFIIB and TFIIF.

We previously found evidence that circularized oligodeoxynucleotides (coligos) containing certain sequences and secondary structures can template the synthesis of small RNA by RNA polymerase III in vitro and in human cells. By using immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase III we now report corroborating evidence that this enzyme is the sole polymerase responsible for coligo transcription. The immobilized polymerase enabled experiments showing that coligo transcripts can be formed through transcription termination without subsequent 3' end trimming. To better define the determinants of productive transcription, a structure-activity relationship study was performed using over 20 new coligos. The results show that unpaired nucleotides in the coligo stem facilitate circumtranscription, but also that internal loops and bulges should be kept small to avoid secondary transcription initiation sites. A polymerase termination sequence embedded in the double-stranded region of a hairpin-encoding coligo stem can antagonize transcription. Using lessons learned from new and old coligos, we demonstrate how to convert poorly transcribed coligos into productive templates.

Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) initiates at the core promoter. Core promoters, which encompass the transcription start site, may contain functional core promoter elements, such as the TATA box, initiator, TCT and downstream core promoter element. TRF2 (TATA-box-binding protein-related factor 2) does not bind TATA box-containing promoters. Rather, it is recruited to core promoters via sequences other than the TATA box.

In contrast, CTD repeats are conserved in both green algae and their more complex land plant relatives. Understanding the mechanistic differences that underlie these variant patterns of CTD evolution requires knowledge of CTD-associated proteins in these 2 lineages. To provide an initial baseline comparison, we bound potential phospho-CTD associated proteins (PCAPs) to artificially synthesized and phosphorylated CTD repeats from the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae and green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results indicate that red and green algae share a number of PCAPs, including kinases and proteins involved in mRNA export. There also are important taxon-specific differences, including mRNA splicing-related PCAPs recovered from Chlamydomonas but not Cyanidioschyzon, consistent with the relative intron densities in green and red algae. Our results also offer the first experimental indication that different proteins bind 2 distinct types of repeats in Cyanidioschyzon, suggesting a division of function between the proximal and distal CTD, similar to patterns identified in more developmentally complex model organisms.

In this report, we further dissect the structural requirement for SRSF2 to function as a transcription activator and extend the analysis to multiple SR and hnRNP proteins by using the MS2 tethering strategy. Our results reveal that SRSF2 is a unique SR protein that activates transcription in a position-dependent manner while three other SR proteins enhance translation in a position-independent fashion.

Within this high affinity conformation, we propose that TFIID's extensive interaction with promoter DNA leads to topological changes in the DNA that facilitate the eventual loading of RNAP II. While more work is required to dissect the individual contributions of activators and repressors to TFIID's DNA binding, the recent cryo-EM studies provide a physical framework to guide future structural, biophysical, and biochemical experiments. ","227":"Exonuclease (exo) III was used as a probe of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) ternary elongation complex (TEC) downstream border. In the absence of NTPs, RNAP appears to stall primarily in a post-translocated state and to return slowly to a pre-translocated state. Exo III mapping, therefore, appears inconsistent with an unrestrained thermal ratchet model for translocation, in which RNAP freely and rapidly oscillates between pre- and post-translocated positions. The forward translocation state is made more stable by lowering the pH and\/or by elevating the salt concentration, indicating a probable role of protonated histidine(s) in regulating accurate NTP loading and translocation. Because the post-translocated TEC can be strongly stabilized by NTP addition, NTP analogs were ranked for their ability to preserve the post-translocation state, giving insight into RNAP fidelity. Effects of NTPs (and analogs) and analysis of chemically modified RNA 3' ends demonstrate that patterns of exo III mapping arise from intrinsic and subtle alterations at the RNAP active site, far from the site of exo III action. ","228":null,"229":"Tumor dormancy is a highly prevalent stage in cancer progression. We have previously generated and characterized in vivo experimental models of human tumor dormancy in which micro-tumors remain occult until they spontaneously shift into rapid tumor growth. We showed that the dormant micro-tumors undergo a stable microRNA (miRNA) switch during their transition from dormancy to a fast-growing phenotype and reported the identification of a consensus signature of human tumor dormancy-associated miRNAs (DmiRs). miRNA-190 (miR-190) is among the most upregulated DmiRs in all dormant tumors analyzed. Upregulation of miR-190 led to prolonged tumor dormancy in otherwise fast-growing glioblastomas and osteosarcomas. Here we investigate the transcriptional changes induced by miR-190 expression in cancer cells and show similar patterns of miR-190 mediated transcriptional reprogramming in both glioblastoma and osteosarcoma cells. The data suggests that miR-190 mediated effects rely on an extensive network of molecular changes in tumor cells and that miR-190 affects several transcriptional factors, tumor suppressor genes and interferon response pathways. The molecular mechanisms governing tumor dormancy described in this work may provide promising targets for early prevention of cancer and may lead to novel treatments to convert the malignant tumor phenotype into an asymptomatic dormant state. ","230":"New approaches using biotinylated-psoralen as a probe for investigating DNA structure have revealed new insights into the relationship between DNA supercoiling, transcription and chromatin compaction.

Examples include RA-bound cellular retinoic acid binding protein I, which activates ERK2. By engaging both cytosolic and nuclear mediators, RA can efficiently augment ESC's epigenome. ","232":"Nascent untranslated transcripts in bacteria are prone to generating RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops); Rho-dependent transcription termination acts to reduce their prevalence. Here we discuss the mechanisms of R-loop formation and growth inhibition in bacteria. ","233":"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a central role in governing eukaryotic cell division. It is becoming clear that the transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is also regulated by CDKs; in metazoans, the cell cycle and transcriptional CDK networks even share an upstream activating kinase, which is itself a CDK. From recent chemical-genetic analyses we know that CDKs and their substrates control events both early in transcription (the transition from initiation to elongation) and late (3' end formation and transcription termination). Moreover, mutual dependence on CDK activity might couple the \"beginning\" and \"end\" of the cycle, to ensure the fidelity of mRNA maturation and the efficient recycling of RNAP II from sites of termination to the transcription start site (TSS). As is the case for CDKs involved in cell cycle regulation, different transcriptional CDKs act in defined sequence on multiple substrates. These phosphorylations are likely to influence gene expression by several mechanisms, including direct, allosteric effects on the transcription machinery, co-transcriptional recruitment of proteins needed for mRNA-capping, splicing and 3' end maturation, dependent on multisite phosphorylation of the RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD) and, perhaps, direct regulation of RNA-processing or histone-modifying machinery. Here we review these recent advances, and preview the emerging challenges for transcription-cycle research. ","234":"Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is one of the key of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways required to preserve genome integrity. Although understanding TCR is still a major challenge, recent single-molecule experiments have brought new insights into the initial steps of TCR leading to new perspectives. ","235":"Core histones are the building block of chromatin and among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes. The related \"deviant\" histones share the histone-fold domain, and serve various roles in DNA metabolism. We provide here a structural and functional outlook of H2A\/H2B-like deviant histones in transcription, replication and remodeling. ","236":"Transcription elongation is now recognized as an important mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes. A large number of genes undergo an early step in transcription that is rate limiting for expression. Genome-wide studies showing that RNA polymerase II accumulates to high densities near the promoters of many genes has led to the idea that promoter-proximal pausing of transcription is a widespread, rate-limiting step in early elongation. Recent evidence suggests that much of this paused RNA polymerase II is competent for transcription elongation. Here, we discuss recent studies suggesting that RNA polymerase II that accumulates nearby the promoter of a subset of genes is undergoing premature termination of transcription.","237":"The eukaryotic chromatin structure is essential in correctly defining transcription units. Impairing this structure can activate cryptic promoters, and lead to the accumulation of aberrant RNA transcripts. Here we discuss critical pathways that are responsible for the repression of cryptic transcription and the maintenance of genome integrity. ","238":"The evolution of higher cognitive functions in humans is thought to be due, at least in part, to the molecular evolution of gene expression patterns specific to the human brain. In this article, we explore recent and past findings using comparative genomics in human and non-human primate brain to identify these novel human patterns. We suggest additional directions and lines of experimentation that should be taken to improve our understanding of these changes on the human lineage. Finally, we attempt to put into context these genomic changes with biological phenotypes and diseases in humans.

Of these three events, the single-strand DNA cytidine deaminase, Activation Induced cytidine Deaminase (AID), is responsible for SHM and CSR. Recent advances, discussed in this review article, point toward various components of RNA polymerase II \"stalling\" machinery as regulators of AID activity during antibody diversification and maintenance of B cell genome integrity.

","242":"The recent publication of two detailed studies of mouse spermatogenesis, either after chemical inhibition of the BET bromodomains, or in the context of genetic alterations of one specific BET member, Brdt, provides the unique opportunity to assess the functional impact of BET bromodomain inhibitors. ","243":"The C-Terminal Domain (CTD) of the large subunit (Rpb1) of RNA Polymerase II has a Tyrosine-Serine-Proline-Threonine-Serine-Proline-Serine repeat structure in many eukaryotes. Chemical modifications of these residues play a central role in the regulation and coordination of the events of transcription. However, substantial variability in the presence and regularity of repeat arrays exists between eukaryote taxa. Following a survey of CTD structure from diverse eukaryote species, two hypotheses were tested relating to repeat structure and the action of selection on the CTD. First, it was found that degenerated repeat structure is associated with lower serine and proline frequencies in some eukaryote taxa but not in others. Second, maximum likelihood models of the evolution of Rpb1 in a number of species groups found that purifying selection on the non-repetitive CTD of several Leishmania species was substantially lower than for the rest of Rpb1, whereas purifying selection in a number of species groups containing repeat arrays was usually as high or nearly as high as for the rest of Rpb1. Characterization of CTD structure for a larger number of species than has been completed previously also revealed a greater diversity of CTD structures in eukaryotes than previously known, along with loss of repeat structure in the animals and fungi, two taxa where it has not previously been known. These results suggest that loss of CTD repeat structure has been an important aspect of RNA Polymerase II evolution in diverse eukaryotes.

","247":"The Mediator is a multi-subunit complex that transduces regulatory information from transcription regulators to the RNA polymerase II apparatus. Growing evidence suggests that Mediator plays roles in multiple stages of eukaryotic transcription, including elongation. However, the detailed mechanism by which Mediator regulates elongation remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that Mediator MED23 subunit controls a basal level of transcription by recruiting elongation factor P-TEFb, via an interaction with its CDK9 subunit. The mRNA level of Egr1, a MED23-controlled model gene, is reduced 4-5 fold in Med23 (-\/-)  ES cells under an unstimulated condition, but Med23-deficiency does not alter the occupancies of RNAP II, GTFs, Mediator complex, or activator ELK1 at the Egr1 promoter. Instead, Med23 depletion results in a significant decrease in P-TEFb and RNAP II (Ser2P) binding at the coding region, but no changes for several other elongation regulators, such as DSIF and NELF. ChIP-seq revealed that Med23-deficiency partially reduced the P-TEFb occupancy at a set of MED23-regulated gene promoters. Further, we demonstrate that MED23 interacts with CDK9 in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these results provide the mechanistic insight into how Mediator promotes RNAP II into transcription elongation.","248":"DNA lesions pose a physical obstacle to DNA-dependent cellular transactions such as replication and transcription. A great deal is known regarding RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription stalling in the presence of lesions induced by UV, but recent studies have uncovered previously uncharacterized behavior of the RNAP II machinery in the presence of double strand breaks (DSBs). These new data, although contradictory, contribute to our understanding of a vital cellular mechanism that defends against the production of aberrant transcripts and protects cell viability.","249":"TAF7, a component of the TFIID complex, controls the first steps of transcription. It interacts with and regulates the enzymatic activities of transcription factors that regulate RNA polymerase II progression. Its diverse functions in transcription initiation are consistent with its essential role in cell proliferation.","250":"Exonuclease (Exo) III was used to probe translocation states of RNA polymerase (RNAP) ternary elongation complexes (TECs). Escherichia coli RNAP stalls primarily in a post-translocation register that makes relatively slow excursions to a hyper-translocated state or to a pre-translocated state. Tagetitoxin (TGT) strongly inhibits hyper-translocation and inhibits backtracking, so, as indicated by Exo III mapping, TGT appears to stabilize both the pre- and probably a partially post-translocation state of RNAP. Because the pre-translocated to post-translocated transition is slow at many template positions, these studies appear inconsistent with a model in which RNAP makes frequent and rapid (i.e., millisecond phase) oscillations between pre- and post-translocation states. Nine nucleotides (9-nt) and 10-nt TECs, and TECs with longer nascent RNAs, have distinct translocation properties consistent with a 9-10 nt RNA\/DNA hybrid. RNAP mutant proteins in the bridge helix and trigger loop are identified that inhibit or stimulate forward and backward translocation.","251":"ChIP-sequencing is a method of choice to localize the positions of protein binding sites on DNA on a whole genomic scale.

However, very little is known about the involvement of the cell cycle CDK Cdc28 in the transcription process. We have recently shown that, upon cell cycle entry, Cdc28 kinase activity boosts transcription of a subset of genes by directly stimulating the basal transcription machinery. Here, we discuss the biological significance of this finding and give our view of the kinase-dependent role of Cdc28 in regulation of RNA polymerase II.","254":"The bromodomain protein BRD4 links cell cycle and transcription, bookmarking active genes during mitosis and serving as a scaffold for transcription factors. Our recent discovery that BRD4 is a RNA Polymerase II CTD kinase identifies a novel transcriptional function.

Recent studies have shown its role in the epigenetic regulation of an oncogenic microRNA, revealing a novel mode of tumor suppression that is independent of its well-established role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.","256":"The p300 and CBP co-activators are histone acetylases and central regulators of transcription in metazoans. The genomic occupancy of p300\/CBP detected by ChIP-seq experiments can be used to identify transcriptional enhancers. However, studies in Drosophila embryos suggest that there is a preference for some transcription factors in directing p300\/CBP to the genome. Although p300\/CBP occupancy in general correlates with gene activation, they can also be found at silent genomic regions, which does not result in histone acetylation. Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 is associated with repression, but does not preclude p300\/CBP binding. An antagonism between H3K27ac and H3K27me3 indicates that p300\/CBP may be involved in switching between repressed and active chromatin states.","257":"The core promoter of eukaryotic genes is structurally and functionally diverse and contributes to the combinatorial control of gene-specific transcription. Recent findings identifying specific coactivators and architectural proteins as core promoter-specific basal cofactors for RNA polymerase II suggest possible mechanisms for the core promoter selectivity of certain regulators and enhancers.","258":"A recent study provides evidence that RNA polymerase uses 2- to ~4-nt RNAs, species termed \"nanoRNAs,\" to prime transcription initiation in Escherichia coli. Priming of transcription initiation with nanoRNAs represents a previously undocumented component of transcription start site selection and gene expression.","259":"Interferon-stimulated transcription is thought to occur mainly through the action of the JAK\/STAT pathway. However, recent findings revealed an additional PI3K\/Akt-dependent pathway, which contributes to the induction of a set of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the regulation of the transcriptional repressor EMSY.","260":"Since its discovery more than a decade ago, H3K4 methylation has become synonymous with transcription. We only now have begun to realize that the distinct states of H3K4 methylation have unique distributions and specialized roles in other chromatin-related processes. Here, I discuss recent findings addressing their regulation and functions.","261":"Candida albicans is a commensal microorganism of the human microbiome; it is also the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans. Many infections caused by C. albicans are a direct consequence of its proclivity to form biofilms--resilient, surface-associated communities of cells where individual cells acquire specialized properties that are distinct from those observed in suspension cultures. We recently identified the transcriptional network that orchestrates the formation of biofilms in C. albicans. These results set the stage for understanding how biofilms are formed and, once formed, how the specialized properties of biofilms are elaborated. This information will provide new insight for understanding biofilms in more detail and may lead to improvements in preventing and treating biofilm-based infections in the future.","262":"Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been identified as a proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in various types of human cancers. CIP2A acts by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A-dependent destabilization of c-Myc, resulting in increased cell proliferation. Here, we have characterized the proximal promoter region of the human CIP2A gene in cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cells. The 5' flanking minimal proximal promoter of the CIP2A gene consists of putative binding sites for Ets1 and Elk1 in forward and reverse orientations. Here, we show that Ets1 and Elk1 binding is essential for CIP2A basal expression in several urogenital cancer cell lines. Interestingly, both Ets1 and Elk1 are required together for CIP2A expression, as siRNA knockdown of Ets1 and Elk1 together decreased CIP2A gene transcription, whereas knockdown of Ets1 or Elk1 alone had no effect. Moreover, ectopic expression of Ets1 and Elk1 together increased CIP2A expression. To gain physiological significance of the Ets1 and Elk1 regulation we observed, a panel of matched human cervical carcinoma samples was analyzed for the expression of CIP2A and Ets1 and\/or Elk1. We found a direct correlation between the levels of CIP2A and the levels of Ets1 and Elk1. Our results suggest that the binding of Ets1 and Elk1 together to the proximal CIP2A promoter is absolutely required for CIP2A expression in cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cell lines. Thus, different factors regulate CIP2A expression in a cell-type specific manner. As previous work has shown a requirement for only Ets1 in prostate and gastric carcinomas, our results now indicate that CIP2A regulation is more complex than previously determined.","263":"Transcription termination of RNA polymerase II between closely spaced genes is an important, though poorly understood, mechanism. This is true, in particular, in the Drosophila genome, where approximately 52% of tandem genes are separated by less than 1 kb. We show that a set of Drosophila tandem genes has a negative correlation of gene expression and display several molecular marks indicative of promoter pausing. We find that an intergenic spacing of 168 bp is sufficient for efficient transcription termination between the polo-snap tandem gene pair, by a mechanism that is independent of Pcf11 and Xrn2. In contrast, analysis of a tandem gene pair containing a longer intergenic region reveals that termination occurs farther downstream of the poly(A) signal and is, in this case, dependent on Pcf11 and Xrn2. For polo-snap, displacement of poised polymerase from the snap promoter by depletion of the initiation factor TFIIB results in an increase of polo transcriptional read-through. This suggests that poised polymerase is necessary for transcription termination. Interestingly, we observe that polo forms a TFIIB dependent gene loop between its promoter and terminator regions. Furthermore, in a plasmid containing the polo-snap locus, deletion of the polo promoter causes an increase in snap expression, as does deletion of polo poly(A) signals. Taken together, our results indicate that polo forms a gene loop and polo transcription termination occurs by an Xrn2 and Pcf11 independent mechanism that requires TFIIB.","264":"The conserved multi-subunit Elongator complex was initially described as a RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) associated transcription elongation factor, but since has been shown to be involved a variety of different cellular activities. Here, we summarize recent developments in the field and discuss the resulting implications for the proposed multi-functionality of Elongator.","265":"Recent findings provide evidence that tDNAs function as chromatin insulators from yeast to humans. TFIIIC, a transcription factor that interacts with the B-box in tDNAs as well as thousands of ETC sites in the genome, is responsible for insulator function. Though tDNAs are capable of enhancer-blocking and barrier activities for which insulators are defined, new insights into the relationship between insulators and chromatin structure suggest that TFIIIC serves a complex role in genome organization. We review the role of tRNA genes and TFIIIC as chromatin insulators, and highlight recent findings that have broadened our understanding of insulators in genome biology.","266":"The proto-oncogene c-Maf has been shown to be an important transcriptional regulator in the differentiation of a number of cellular contexts, like the eye and hematopoietic system.

Although it has been thought that chloroplast transcription is mediated by a basically cyanobacterium-derived system, due to the endosymbiotic origin of plastids, recent studies suggest the existence of a hybrid transcription machinery containing non-bacterial proteins that have been newly acquired during plant evolution. Here, we highlight chloroplast-specific non-bacterial transcription mechanisms by which land plant chloroplasts have gained novel functions.","268":"The ubiquitin proteasome system plays an important role in transcription. Monoubiquitination of activators is believed to aid their function, while the 26S proteasomal degradation of repressors is believed to restrict their function.

Subsequent research has revealed HCF-1 to be an abundant chromatin-associated protein that regulates various stages of the cell cycle. Recent reports show that HCF-1 interacts with diverse E2F proteins to induce cell-cycle-specific transcription. HCF-1 can act as a scaffold to a variety of histone-modifying proteins and these HCF-1-E2F-containing multi-protein complexes can bring about context-dependent activation or repression of transcription.

We review here recent findings derived from the study of the hematopoietic system.","283":"TFIIF is considered to be a general transcription factor, based on the fact that it is essential for assembly of RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes on fully double-stranded templates in vitro. Existing models assign various tasks to TFIIF during preinitiation complex formation and transcript initiation. Recent results do not support all aspects of those models but they do emphasize the significance of the interaction of TFIIF and TFIIB. Other recent findings raise the possibility that a fraction of RNA polymerase II transcription complex assembly proceeds through a pathway that is independent of TFIIF.","284":"Single-molecule studies of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) require high yields of transcription elongation complexes (TECs) with long DNA tethers upstream and downstream of the TEC. Here we report on a robust system to reconstitute both yeast and mammalian RNAP II with an efficiency of ~80% into TECs that elongate with an efficiency of ~90%, followed by rapid, high-efficiency tripartite ligation of long DNA fragments upstream and downstream of the reconstituted TECs. Single mammalian and yeast TECs reconstituted with this method have been successfully used in an optical-trapping transcription assay capable of applying forces that either assist or hinder transcript elongation.","285":"The methylation of histones is a fundamental epigenetic process regulating gene expression programs in mammalian cells. Dysregulated patterns of histone methylation are directly implicated in malignant transformation. Here, we report the unexpected finding that the invasive extracellular matrix degrading endoglycosidase heparanase enters the nucleus of activated human T lymphocytes and regulates the transcription of a cohort of inducible immune response genes by controlling histone H3 methylation patterns. It was found that nuclear heparanase preferentially associates with euchromatin. Genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analyses showed that heparanase is recruited to both the promoter and transcribed regions of a distinct cohort of transcriptionally active genes. Knockdown and overexpression of the heparanase gene also showed that chromatin-bound heparanase is a prerequisite for the transcription of a subset of inducible immune response genes in activated T cells. Furthermore, the actions of heparanase seem to influence gene transcription by associating with the demethylase LSD1, preventing recruitment of the methylase MLL and thereby modifying histone H3 methylation patterns. These data indicate that heparanase belongs to an emerging class of proteins that play an important role in regulating transcription in addition to their well-recognized extra-nuclear functions.","286":"Research in the last decade revealed an additional role for the Replication Licensing Factor Cdc6 in transcriptional regulation.

Other studies have shown that such differences are mainly due to modulation of mRNA stabilities. Here we analyze the relationship between the presence of cryptic transcripts in genes and their stress response profiles. Despite some of the stress-responding gene groups being indeed enriched in specific classes of cryptic transcripts, we found no statistically significant evidence that cryptic transcription is responsible for the differences observed between mRNA and transcription rate profiles.","292":null,"293":null,"294":"Inhibiting transcriptional elongation is a recurrent mechanism to keep cells in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state in metazoans.

Among the proteins binding cotranscriptionally to the mRNP are mRNA export factors. One of the protein complexes thus coupling transcription to mRNA export is the TREX complex. However, despite the fact that TREX was identified and characterized about a decade ago, it had remained enigmatic how TREX is recruited to genes. The conserved Prp19 complex (Prp19C) has long been known for its function in splicing. We recently identified Prp19C to be essential for a second step in gene expression namely TREX occupancy at transcribed genes, answering this long-standing question but also raising new ones.","298":"The winged helix (WH) domain is found in core components of transcription systems in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. It represents a sub-class of the helix-turn-helix motif. The WH domain participates in establishing protein-DNA and protein-protein-interactions. Here, we discuss possible explanations for the enrichment of this motif in transcription systems.","299":"Initiation of transcription of most human genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) requires the formation of a preinitiation complex comprising TFIIA, B, D, E, F, H and RNAP II. The general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein and up to 13 TBP-associated factors. During transcription of snRNA genes, RNAP II does not appear to make the transition to long-range productive elongation, as happens during transcription of protein-coding genes. In addition, recognition of the snRNA gene-type specific 3' box RNA processing element requires initiation from an snRNA gene promoter. These characteristics may, at least in part, be driven by factors recruited to the promoter. For example, differences in the complement of TAFs might result in differential recruitment of elongation and RNA processing factors. As precedent, it already has been shown that the promoters of some protein-coding genes do not recruit all the TAFs found in TFIID. Although TAF5 has been shown to be associated with RNAP II-transcribed snRNA genes, the full complement of TAFs associated with these genes has remained unclear. Here we show, using a ChIP and siRNA-mediated approach, that the TBP\/TAF complex on snRNA genes differs from that found on protein-coding genes. Interestingly, the largest TAF, TAF1, and the core TAFs, TAF10 and TAF4, are not detected on snRNA genes. We propose that this snRNA gene-specific TAF subset plays a key role in gene type-specific control of expression.","300":"Non-coding RNAs have been found to regulate many cellular processes and thus expand the functional genetic repertoire contained within the genome. With the recent advent of genomic tools, it is now evident that these RNA molecules play central regulatory roles in many transcriptional programs. Here we discuss how they are targeted to promoters in several cases and how they operate at specific points in the transcription cycle to precisely control gene expression.","301":"In a recent paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Artsimovitch et al. report a major revision of a crystallographic model and proposed mechanism of the RNA polymerase inhibitor, tagetitoxin. This reassessment is based on theoretical modeling using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we argue that this theoretical model contradicts experimental results and a published crystal structure cannot exclude several mechanistically distinct alternative models and does not support some major conclusions. We conclude that understanding the tagetitoxin mechanism is beyond the reach of currently available computational simulations and must await input from high-resolution crystal structures of tagetitoxin bound to elongation complex, extensive biochemical studies, or both.","302":"Genetic effects on gene regulation make a substantial contribution to phenotypic diversity, yet their mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we discuss the potential insights to be gained from mapping gene-environment interactions at regulatory polymorphisms (i.e., genetic variation that affects gene expression under specific environmental conditions). We highlight a novel statistical method to identify specific patterns of gene-environment interaction at these regulatory polymorphisms. Reviewing its application to a study that mapped gene expression in the presence and absence of glucocorticoids, we discuss the mechanistic insights that this approach provides.","303":null,"304":"Gad2 encodes GAD65, which is present preferentially in presynaptic terminals for synthesis of GABA for vesicle release. Gad2 is a regulatory target of cell activities in various brain functions and in GABA perturbation-related neurological diseases. However, our understanding of how Gad2 is transcriptionally regulated and how Gad2 transcription responds to changing cell environment under these conditions is still limited. This review discusses recent advances in the regulatory mechanisms for Gad2 transcription and highlights the characteristics of TATA-less Gad2 promoters and regulation of Gad2 transcription by CREB and by activity-dependent epigenetic modification of the chromatin structure in regulatory elements of the Gad2 gene.","305":"VEGF is a pivotal pro-angiogenic growth factor and its dosage decisively impacts vascularization. We recently identified a CTCF-dependent chromatin insulator that critically restrains the transcriptional induction of VEGF and angiogenesis. We postulate that CTCF may exert enhancer blocking by mediating chromatin looping and\/or RNA polymerase pausing at the VEGF locus.","306":"With the help of only two enzymes--an RNA polymerase and a ribonuclease--reduced versions of transcriptional regulatory circuits can be implemented in vitro. These circuits enable the emulation of naturally occurring biochemical networks, the exploration of biological circuit design principles and the biochemical implementation of powerful computational models.","307":"In their commentary, Klyuyev and Vassylyev dispute a model of transcription inhibition by tagetitoxin (Tgt) proposed by us based on biochemical analysis and computational docking. We maintain that, although an alternative explanation can be provided for any single observation reported by us, taken together our results support a model in which Tgt acts by trapping the trigger loop (TL) in an inactive state (Artsimovitch et al.). This model is consistent with all the data collected with a physiological target for the inhibitor, the transcription elongation complex (EC). The Tgt-binding pose in our model is indeed different from that observed in the structure of the Thermus thermophilus RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme in the absence of nucleic acids (Vassylyev et al. Nat Struct Mol Biol 2005; 12:1086). The latter can hardly be considered a dogma because RNAP undergoes conformational changes in the course of the transcription cycle and during catalysis and small molecules containing phosphates likely bind to several sites on RNAP, with the crystallographic site\/pose not necessarily being the one most relevant mechanistically. Furthermore, the model proposed based on the Tgt\/holoenzyme structure does not explain the inhibitor's effects on transcript elongation and RNAP translocation. These arguments necessitate further inquiry into the mechanism of inhibition by Tgt by techniques orthogonal to X-ray crystallography. In our opinion, elucidation of a molecular mechanism of any RNAP inhibitor and the follow-up design of more potent derivatives requires a combination of approaches, including genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, X-ray crystallography and computational analysis.","308":"RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation is important for various transcription-related processes. Here, we identify by affinity purification and mass spectrometry three previously uncharacterized human CTD-interaction domain (CID)-containing proteins, RPRD1A, RPRD1B and RPRD2, which co-purify with RNAP II and three other RNAP II-associated proteins, RPAP2, GRINL1A and RECQL5, but not with the Mediator complex. RPRD1A and RPRD1B can accompany RNAP II from promoter regions to 3'-untranslated regions during transcription in vivo, predominantly interact with phosphorylated RNAP II, and can reduce CTD S5- and S7-phosphorylated RNAP II at target gene promoters. Thus, the RPRD proteins are likely to have multiple important roles in transcription.","309":null,"310":"Enhancers play a critical role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression, but their molecular mechanisms of function have not been fully characterized. It is now increasingly clear that enhancers associate with specific protein factors and chromatin modifications and also produce non-coding RNAs known as eRNAs. These predictive signatures have facilitated genomic identification of enhancers and helped characterize tissue-specific gene expression mechanisms. Herein we review recent studies investigating enhancers in mammalian cells, and propose that enhancers function as a central platform integrating lineage-specific transcription factors and epigenetic states with ubiquitous yet signal-dependent transcriptional inputs, culminating in highly specific gene expression programs.","311":"Work over the last two decades has provided a wealth of data indicating that the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery can play an important role in facilitating the splicing of its transcripts. In particular, the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II large subunit (CTD) is central in the coupling of transcription and splicing. While this has long been assumed to involve physical interactions between splicing factors and the CTD, few functional connections between the CTD and such factors have been established. We recently used a biochemical approach to identify a splicing factor that interacts directly with the CTD to activate splicing and, in doing so, may play a role in the process of spliceosome assembly.","312":"Splicing can occur co-transcriptionally. What happens when the splicing reaction lags after the completed transcriptional process? We found that elongation rates are independent of ongoing splicing on the examined genes and suggest that when transcription has completed but splicing has not, the splicing machinery is retained at the site of transcription, independently of the polymerase.","313":"Signaling through the Rho family of small GTPases regulates a variety of cellular processes via changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Here we discuss recent findings that show the transcription factor p53 regulates the expression of several Rho pathway signaling molecules, and how mutation of p53 in cancer dramatically alters signaling output through this pathway.","314":"The proto-oncogene MDM2 inhibits p53 and plays a key role in cell growth control and apoptosis. Identification of two antagonizing MDM2 polymorphisms, SNP285 and SNP309, affecting cancer risk through modulation of Sp1 transcription factor binding, shed new light on the biological activity and phylogeny of this gene.","315":"The core promoter of eukaryotic coding and non-coding genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is composed of DNA elements surrounding the transcription start site. These elements serve as the docking site of the basal transcription machinery and have an important role in determining the position and directing the rate of transcription initiation. This review summarizes the current knowledge about core promoter elements and focuses on several unexpected links between core promoter structure and certain gene features. These include the association between the presence or absence of a TATA-box and gene length, gene structure, gene function, evolution rate and transcription elongation.","316":"It is well established that ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers modulate DNA access of transcription factors and RNA polymerases by \"opening\" or \"closing\" chromatin structure. However, this view is far too simplistic. Recent findings have demonstrated that these enzymes not only set the stage for the transcription machinery to act but are actively involved at every step of the transcription process. As a consequence, they affect initiation, elongation, termination and RNA processing. In this review we will use the CHD family as a paradigm to illustrate the progress that has been made in revealing these new concepts.","317":"The TFIIB linker domain stimulates the catalytic activity of archaeal RNAP. By characterising a range of super-stimulating mutants we identified a novel rate-limiting step in transcription initiation. Our results help to interpret structural findings and pave the way towards higher-resolution structures of the RNAP-TFIIB linker interface.","318":"Recent evidence suggests that post-transcriptional events that are executed in the cytoplasm can be predetermined during transcription. Here, I speculate that this is a widespread mode of regulation and discuss the potential mechanisms, advantages and implications of such a regulatory strategy.","319":null,"320":"In past years, many efforts were invested to define epigenetic features associated with enhancers of transcription. We propose that both transcription initiation and the H3K4me3 histone modification are among the best hallmarks of active enhancers in several primary tissues and extend the concept of large transcription initiation platforms (TIPs).","321":"RNA polymerase II establishes many protein-protein interactions with transcriptional regulators to coordinate gene expression, but little is known about protein domains involved in the contact with them. We use a new approach to look for conserved regions of the RNA pol II of S. cerevisiae located at the surface of the structure of the complex, hypothesizing that they might be involved in the interaction with transcriptional regulators. We defined five different conserved domains and demonstrate that all of them make contact with transcriptional regulators.","322":null,"323":"In B lymphocytes, class switch recombination (CSR) machinery targets highly repetitive sequences, called switch (S) sequences, in the constant domain of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. Cotranscriptional generation of R loops at S sequences provides the substrate for the mutagenic enzyme AID (Activation-Induced cytidine Deaminase), which initiates the DNA breaks at the transcribed sequences. Both sense and antisense transcripts across the S regions have been reported. Our recent work shows that, unlike its sense counterpart, antisense transcription of S sequences is dispensable for CSR in vivo.","324":"STAT proteins are obligate promoters of T helper cell differentiation and initial studies suggested that activation of a single STAT protein resulted in a particular phenotype. More recent work has supported a more complex paradigm wherein the activation of several STAT proteins is required for differentiation to a single effector lineage.","325":"Silenced genes in eukaryotes are packaged into heterochromatin. In addition to establishing a passive storage site for inactive genes in differentiated cells, silencing can play an active role in promoting cellular differentiation. Here, we describe quantitative modeling of silencing processes.","326":"Transcription-coupled DNA repair pathways enable lesions that block transcription to be repaired more quickly than similar lesions in other parts of the genome. Here I consider the recent progress that has been made in understanding how bacteria prioritize certain lesions for nucleotide excision repair.","327":"Transcription is a complicated, multistep process requiring stringent control. Its accuracy may be achieved in part by the conformational changes of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, we discuss the functional relevance of the recently reported conformational changes of RNAP, which may affect transcription control, RNAP translocation and transcription termination.","328":"The three components of the mammalian nuclear SET domain containing protein (NSD) family have been implicated in multiple diseases and cancers, but very little is known about their mechanisms of action. NSD proteins are epigenetic regulators and methylate lysine side chains, particularly lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36), where they appear to deposit mono and\/or dimethyl marks. This modification (H3K36Me) has been shown to be important in various processes including gene expression, alternative splicing and DNA repair. Here, we examine recent findings regarding the oncogenic role of NSD proteins and suggest that a de-regulated switch between H3K36Me and H3K27Me plays an important role in the oncogenic potential of NSD proteins.","329":"Bacterial transcription mediated by RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly regulated process and RNAP action is modulated during the different phases of initiation, elongation and termination by proteins such as the Escherichia coli Nus transcription-factors. Here we discuss the structural interplay and the mechanistic role of the Nus-factors that are directly involved in the processivity of elongation, transcription:translation coupling and termination, as well as the varying effects of these proteins on transcription under the influence of additional signals.","330":"Myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) are the master regulators of skeletal myogenesis. Among the MRFs, Myf5 is the earliest to be expressed and is regulated by a complex set of enhancers. The expression of Myf5 defines different muscle populations in the somite. Furthermore, Myf5 expression is also found in non-muscle tissues, such as preadipocytes and neurons. Here, we present a current view on the regulation of skeletal myogenesis by transcription factors and cellular signals, with an emphasis on the complexity of transcriptional activation of Myf5. We also discuss Myf5 expression in different populations of myoblasts, preadipocytes and neuronal tissue.","331":null,"332":"Non-coding transcripts originating from bidirectional promoters have been reported in a wide range of organisms. In yeast, these divergent transcripts can be subdivided into two classes. Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. This is the same processing pathway used by yeast snoRNAs. Whereas CUTs are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts (SUTs) are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that SUTs are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Therefore, SUTs may be processed similarly to mRNAs. Surprisingly, both CUTs and SUTs were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation. The functions, if any, of these extended CUTs and SUTs are unknown, but their discovery suggests that yeasts generate transcripts reminiscent of long non-coding RNAs found in higher eukaryotes.","333":"In response to environmental and nutritional stimuli, a whole array of proteins remodel genome architecture, activate or transcribe genes, suppress genes, repair lesions and base-modifications, faithfully replicate and safely separate the parental and daughter genomes during cell division. Negotiating and resolving conflicts of genome trafficking is essential for genome stability.","334":"Ubiquitylation has emerged as an omnipresent factor at all levels of transcriptional regulation. A recent study that describes the yeast transcriptional activator Met4 as a functional component of the very same ubiquitin ligase that regulates its own activity highlights the close relation between transcription and the ubiquitin proteasome system.","335":"Oscillating gene expression is a mechanism of patterning during development in both plants and animals. In vertebrates, oscillating gene expression establishes the musculoskeletal precursors (somites), while in plant roots it establishes the position of future organs (lateral roots). Both mechanisms constitute a specialized type of biological clock that converts temporal information into precise spatial patterns. Similarities, differences, and their functionality in organisms that evolved independently are discussed.","336":"Transcription of ncDNA occurs throughout eukaryotic genomes, generating a wide array of ncRNAs. One large class of ncRNAs includes those transcribed over the promoter regions of nearby protein coding genes. Recent studies, primarily focusing on individual genes have uncovered multiple mechanisms by which promoter-associated transcriptional activity locally alters gene expression.","337":"The C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II undergoes a cycle of phosphorylation which allows it to temporally couple transcription with transcription-associated processes. The characterization of hitherto unrecognized metazoan elongation phase CTD kinase activities expands our understanding of this coupling. We discuss the circumstances that delayed the recognition of these kinase activities.","338":"The Drosophila melanogaster fourth chromosome contains interspersed domains of active and repressive chromatin. We investigated a stock harboring a silenced transgene inserted into Dyrk3 and near Caps-two expressed genes on chromosome four. In an HP1a-deficient background, transgene expression was activated while, paradoxically, expression of Dyrk3 and Caps was reduced. We found that the promoters of Dyrk3 and Caps contained DNase I hypersensitive sites but also possessed methylated histone H3 and HP1a, marks of repressive chromatin. In HP1a-deficient flies, the Dyrk3 and Caps promoters displayed diminished accessibility to nuclease digestion, revealing a surprising role for HP1a in opening chromatin.","339":"The heat shock response has been characterized by the induction of major heat shock proteins that suppress protein aggregation by facilitating protein folding. Recently, we found that mammalian heat shock factor 1, a master regulator of HSP genes, regulates non-HSP genes that suppress protein aggregation by controlling protein degradation in cooperation with the transcription factor NFAT.","340":"Unlike prokaryotes, in which transcription and translation are coupled, eukaryotes physically separate transcription in the nucleus from mRNA translation and degradation in the cytoplasm. However, recent evidence has revealed that the full picture is more complex and that the nuclear transcription machinery plays specific roles in regulating the cytoplasmic fate of mRNA.","341":"Most genome transactions are favored by DNA (-) torsional stress, i.e., unconstrained unwinding or supercoiling of DNA. A question raised here is whether DNA (+) torsional stress, which precludes DNA unwinding, could also be relevant in gene regulation. Such DNA twist dynamics could be determined by chromatin architecture.","342":"Histone acetylation modulates histone occupancy both at promoters and in coding sequences. Based on our recent observation that HDACs in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are co-transcriptionally recruited to coding regions by elongating polymerases, we propose a model in which Pol II facilitates recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes as well as other factors required for productive elongation.","343":"Ribosome biogenesis begins with the orchestrated expression of hundreds of genes, including the three large classes of ribosomal protein, ribosome biogenesis and snoRNA genes. Current knowledge about the corresponding promoters suggests the existence of novel class-specific transcriptional strategies and crosstalk between telomere length and cell growth control.","344":"In eukaryotes transcription is complicated by the DNA being packed in nucleosomes and by supercoils induced by opening of the DNA double helix during elongation. Here we discuss our recent genome-wide work regarding topoisomerases and their role in chromatin remodeling during the transcription cycle and we report a novel function for topoisomerases in transcription termination.","345":"Promoter DNA melting, culminating in the loading of the single-stranded DNA template into the RNA polymerase active site, is a key step in transcription initiation. Recently, the first transcription inhibitors found to block distinct steps of promoter melting were characterized. Here, the impact of these studies is discussed with respect to the current models of transcription initiation.","346":"We recently demonstrated that the core transcription initiation complex in human mitochondria is a two-component system (POLRMT and h-mtTFB2). Human mtTFA\/TFAM, previously proposed to be a requisite initiation complex member, is dispensable for promoter-specific initiation in vitro. We propose that it instead regulates relative promoter activity and\/or overall nucleoid transcription and replication potential.","347":"X-chromosome inactivation balances X-chromosome dosages in male and female mammals by transcriptionally repressing one X in the female sex. Proper counting and the mutually exclusive choice of active X and inactive X have been hypothesized to involve X-chromosome crosstalk via homologous chromosome pairing. Transient pairing of two female Xs requires noncoding Tsix and Xite. A recent study suggested a new pairing element (Xpr), located ~200 kb upstream of Xist, in the Xpct region. Xpr is proposed to induce pairing and activate Xist expression. Here, we further characterize Xpr and find that the Xpr sequence is unstable when introduced as transgenes into male ES cells. Xpr transgenes show an unusual tendency to disperse throughout the nucleus. However, we observe neither pairing between Xpr alleles nor ectopic Xist expression. In the absence of Tsix, Xpr does not induce inter-allelic Xic interactions. Female ES cells carrying Xpr transgenes are more stable. Nonetheless, pairing also does not seem to occur in female cells. We conclude that, while Xpr contains unusual properties, it most likely does not serve as a pairing or counting element. Differences in statistical methods and controls may explain some of the discrepancies.","348":"Research of the past decade showed that transcriptional regulation could be a highly dynamic and cyclical process. Many transcription factors and their co-regulators cyclically associate with a periodicity of 30-75 min with regulatory chromatin regions resulting in dynamically changing chromatin marks and cyclical activities of RNA polymerase II in mRNA synthesis.","349":"Glucose and glutamine are the most abundant circulating nutrients and support the growth and proliferation of all cells, in particular rapidly growing and dividing cancer cells. Several recent studies implicate an expanded Myc network in how cells sense and utilize both glucose and glutamine. These studies reveal an unappreciated coordination between glycolysis and glutaminolysis, potentially providing new targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer.","350":"The proteasome has been implicated in transcriptional control in a bewildering number of ways, and many questions remain about how functional selectivity is conferred to its action. Here we discuss transcriptional roles for the ubiquitin receptor Rad23 and posit that such receptors may be key players dictating proteasome transcriptional specificity.","351":null,"352":"Sirtuins are the mammalian homologs of the yeast histone deacetylase Sir2. In recent years, an ever-expanding picture has emerged indicating that these proteins (SIRT1-7) play broad functions in cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, energy metabolism, aging and tumorigenesis. Among members of this family, SIRT6 appears to have particular significance in regulating metabolism, DNA repair and lifespan. In this context, new research from our lab has established SIRT6 as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis. In this Point of View article, we will first highlight our recent findings, and then provide an in-depth discussion of their implications in cancer and aging.","353":"In the last years some efforts in the characterization of transcription factors involved in stomatal movements in plants have been undertaken. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that plants adopt to cope with abiotic stress and offer new strategies to improve plant drought tolerance.","354":"hTERT and NFAT were thought until recently to belong to separate metabolic compartments. The involvement of NFAT in the induction of hTERT transcription suggested by hTERT expression variations during lymphocyte stimulation and immunosuppressive treatments explains the link between hTERT expression and cell stimulation and offers new insights for therapeutic developments.","355":"When the DNA of a cell is damaged, cell cycle progression is arrested and cell cycle-specific transcription is inhibited. However, cell cycle-specific transcription is required for eventual recovery from the DNA damage-induced arrest. Here we discuss recent findings that demonstrate how transcription is fine-tuned during the DNA damage response and how this controls the capacity to recover from a DNA damage arrest in G(2) phase.","356":"Mouse B2 RNA represses RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription during the cellular heat shock response. B2 RNA binds Pol II, enters complexes at promoters, and keeps the polymerase from engaging the DNA. Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser5 residues in the Pol II carboxy terminal domain (CTD) decreases after heat shock at the promoter of the repressed actin gene in mouse cells, despite the continued presence of Cdk7 and cyclin H. Biochemical assays revealed that B2 RNA, when present with Pol II in promoter-bound complexes, specifically represses CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH.","357":"The traditional model for transcription sees active polymerases tracking along their templates. An alternative (controversial) model has active enzymes immobilized in \"factories.\" Recent evidence supports the idea that the DNA moves, not the polymerase, and points to alternative explanations of how regulatory motifs like enhancers and silencers work.","358":"In Escherichia coli, the transcription elongation factor NusA is associated with all elongating RNA polymerases where it functions in transcription termination and antitermination. Here, we review our recent results implicating NusA in the recruitment of DNA repair and damage tolerance mechanisms to sites of stalled transcription complexes.","359":"The structure of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (MTERF1) provides novel insight into the mechanism of binding, recognition of the termination sequence and the conformational changes involved in mediating termination. Besides its functional implications, this structure provides a framework to understand the consequences of numerous diseases associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations.","360":"The human Mediator complex interacts extensively with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme and recent data from our lab suggest activator-induced structural shifts within Mediator trigger activation of stalled Pol II. These results are discussed together with other recent findings regarding post-recruitment regulation of Pol II.","361":"Non-coding regions of the human genome contain vast regulatory potential that contributes to the coordination of gene expression. Indeed, regulatory elements can reside large genomic distances from the promoters of genes they control. Here we describe approaches recently used to identify functional elements within the complex CFTR locus.","362":"Microphthalmia-associated Transcription Factor, MITF, is a master regulator of melanocyte development, differentiation, migration, and survival.(1) A broad collection of studies have indicated that MITF directly regulates the transcription of genes involved in pigmentation, which are selective to the melanocyte lineage. In addition, MITF controls expression of genes which are expressed in multiple cell lineages, and may also play differential roles in activating vs. maintaining gene expression patterns. In this Point of View article, we discuss lineage restricted transcription factor activation of both tissue-specific and ubiquitously expressed genes using melanocytes and MITF as a model system that may eventually provide insights into such processes in multiple cell lineages.","363":"Mycobacteria CarD is an essential RNAP binding protein that regulates many transcripts including rRNA. This article will review our present state of knowledge regarding CarD and compare the known functions of CarD with other RNAP binding proteins in E. coli, emphasizing how this information can guide future investigations.","364":"Transcriptional interference is the in cis suppression of one transcriptional process by another. Mathematical modeling shows that promoter occlusion by elongating RNA polymerases cannot produce strong interference. Interference may instead be generated by (1) dislodgement of slow-to-assemble pre-initiation complexes and transcription factors and (2) prolonged occlusion by paused RNA polymerases.","365":"C\/EBPs are implied in an amazing number of cellular functions: C\/EBPs regulate tissue and cell type specific gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation control. C\/EBPs assist in energy metabolism, female reproduction, innate immunity, inflammation, senescence, and the development of neoplasms. How can C\/EBPs fulfill so many functions? Here we discuss that C\/EBPs are extensively modified by methylation of arginine and lysine side chains and that regulated methylation profoundly affects the activity of C\/EBPs.","366":null,"367":"Replication and transcription machineries progress at high speed on the same DNA template, which inevitably causes traffic accidents. Problems are not only caused by frontal collisions between polymerases, but also by cotranscriptional R-loops. These RNA-DNA hybrids induce genomic instability by blocking fork progression and could be implicated in the development of cancer.","368":"Recent data reveal that gene transcription affects genome stability in mammalian cells. For example, transcription of DNA that is damaged by the most prevalent exogenous genotoxin, UV light, induces nucleotide substitutions and chromosomal instability, collectively called UV-induced transcription-associated mutations (UV-TAM). An important class of UV-TAM consists of nucleotide transitions that are caused by deamination of cytosine-containing photolesions to uracil, presumably occurring at stalled transcription complexes. Transcription-associated deletions and recombinational events after UV exposure may be triggered by collisions of replication forks with stalled transcription complexes. In this Point-of-View we propose that mammalian cells possess two tailored mechanisms to prevent UV-TAM in dermal stem cells. First, the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR) pathway removes lesions at transcribed DNA strands, forming the primary barrier against the mutagenic consequences of transcription at a damaged template. Second, when TCR is absent or when the capacity of TCR is exceeded, persistently stalled transcription complexes induce apoptosis, averting the generation of mutant cells following replication. We hypothesize that TCR and the apoptotic response in conjunction reduce the risk of skin carcinogenesis.","369":"Folding of the trigger loop of RNA polymerase promotes nucleotide addition through creating a closed, catalytically competent conformation of the active center. Here, we discuss the impact of adjacent RNA polymerase elements, including the F loop and the jaw domain, as well as external regulatory factors on the trigger loop folding and catalysis.","370":null,"371":"As a transcription factor, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) regulates the transcription of a dazzling list of genes and the number of its targets still mounts. Recent studies revealed that YY1 possesses functions independent of its DNA binding activity and its regulatory role in tumorigenesis has started to emerge.","372":"Technological advances have enabled researchers to probe gene regulatory pathways on an unprecedented scale. Here, we summarize our recent work that exploits a systematic screening approach in the budding yeast to discover regulators of a promoter of interest. We discuss future applications of our approach based on emerging themes in the literature.","373":"In bacteria, a subset of transcription termination events requires the participation of the transcription termination factor Rho. Rho is a homo-hexameric, ring-shaped, motor protein that uses the energy derived from its RNA-dependent ATPase activity to directionally unwind RNA and RNA-DNA helices and to dissociate transcription elongation complexes. Despite a wealth of structural, biochemical and genetic data, the molecular mechanisms used by Rho to carry out its biological functions remain poorly understood. Here, we briefly discuss the most recent findings on Rho mechanisms and function and highlight important questions that remain to be addressed.","374":null,"375":"Reanalysis of our UV study of p53-mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed an intriguing orchestration of massive transcriptome responses. However, close scrutiny of the data uncovered an affected mRNA\/rRNA ratio, effectively inhibiting valid data analysis. UV-dose range-finding showed low-dose UV specific- and high-dose stress-related responses, which represent a plea for UV dose range-finding in experimental design.","376":"Metazoan development relies upon the precise control of the genome's expression. This enables different cells in the animal to have different properties, despite having the same genetic material, and different animals to have different morphologies despite sharing developmental genes. However, near-identical organisms may have different overall genomic content, suggesting that the mechanisms by which evolution of the phenotype proceeds on a global level are not well understood. We review here recent works that have discovered a tremendous amount of variation between the developmental transcriptomes of both closely and distantly related organisms. It is evident that the evolution of regulatory programs occurs at a rapid rate comparable to that of other genomic processes. Distinguishing the selective pressures on each regulatory element will thus be crucial towards understanding its functional relevance. We propose that such a comparative approach is most suited to the identification of unifying principles in cell fate specification and differentiation in the animal embryo.","377":"The different protein isoforms generated from the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene, an essential regulator of blood vessel formation, differ in biochemical property and functional activity. Despite the relevance of VEGF-A for both normal and pathologic angiogenesis, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA is still in its infancy.","378":"A DNA transposon integrated into -the genome of a primitive mammal some 200 million years ago and, millions of years later, it evolved an essential function in the common ancestor of all placental mammals. This protein, now named ZBED6, was recently discovered because a mutation disrupting one of its binding sites, in an intron of the IGF2 gene, makes pigs grow more muscle. These findings have revealed a new mechanism for regulating muscle growth as well as a novel transcription factor that appears to be of major importance for transcriptional regulation in placental mammals.","379":"We recently identified CpG island promoters driving transcription of human telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). This discovery has shaped a new concept in telomere biology, where TERRA promoters and downstream telomeric sequences constitute autonomous genic units.","380":"Replication forks and transcription complexes often collide, which can result in mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements. Recent studies of E. coli demonstrate a role for transcription factors in reducing conflicts between replication and transcription. These findings suggest that transcription regulators preserve genome integrity by preventing replication fork arrest.","381":"In the course of evolution of multi-cellular eukaryotes, paralogs of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase subunits emerged. Paralogs of transcription factors and of the RPC32 subunit of RNA polymerase III play important roles in cell type- and promoter-specific transcription. Here we discuss their respective functions.","382":"The general transcription factor TFIIB plays essential, but as yet unclear, roles in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. We recently found that phosphorylation of TFIIB is required for productive transcription. We discuss the implications of this work for the functions of TFIIB in promoter escape and gene loop formation.","383":"The RNA polymerase III pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembled on yeast tRNA genes naturally causes replication fork pausing that contributes to genome instability. Mechanistic coupling of the fork pausing activity of tRNA genes to replication has long been considered likely, but only recently demonstrated. In contrast to the expectation that this coupling might occur by a passive mechanism such as direct disruption of transcription factor-DNA complexes by a component of the replisome, it turns out that disassembly of the RNA polymerase III PIC is actively controlled by the replication stress checkpoint signal transduction pathway. This advance supports a new model in which checkpoint-dependent disassembly of the transcription machinery at tRNA genes is a vital component of an overall system of genome stability control that also targets replication and DNA repair proteins.","384":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to epigenetically regulate certain genes in human cells. Here we report evidence for the involvement of an antisense lncRNA in the transcriptional regulation of the pluripotency-associated factor Oct4. When an lncRNA antisense to Oct4-pseudogene 5 was suppressed, transcription of Oct4 and Oct4 pseudogenes 4 and 5 was observed to increase. This increase correlated with a loss of silent state epigenetic marks and the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 at the Oct4 promoter. We observed this lncRNA to interact with nucleolin and PURA, a 35 kD single-stranded DNA and RNA binding protein, and found that these proteins may act to negatively regulate this antisense transcript."},"articletitle":{"0":"The histone chaperone FACT: a guardian of chromatin structure integrity.","1":"m6A RNA modification in transcription regulation.","2":"Emerging insights into the function and structure of the Integrator complex.","3":"Oxidative stress induces Ser 2 dephosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD and premature transcription termination.","4":"Bacterial RNA synthesis: back to the limelight.","5":"Single-molecule insights into torsion and roadblocks in bacterial transcript elongation.","6":"Transcription complexes as RNA chaperones.","7":"Rho-dependent transcription termination: a revisionist view.","8":"Mfd -
