Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with differential expression have been indicated to be participants in the pathogenesis and development of cancer. However, the precise role of lncRNAs in NSCLC is still largely obscure. In this study, we explored a newly discovered intergenic lncRNA LINC00958 in NSCLC. First of all, the online databases suggested that LINC00958 was slightly expressed in human normal lung tissues but upregulated in LUSC tissues. Besides, the upregulation of LINC00958 in both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUSC cell lines was easily found when compared with the normal BEAS-2B cells. In addition, we elucidated that knockdown of LINC00958 led to impaired proliferation, induced apoptosis, and hampered migration in LUAD cells. Moreover, a typical oncogenic pathway, JNK signaling, was verified to be involved in LINC00958-contributed LUAD development. Of note, we explained that LINC00958 exerted the tumor-promoting function in LUAD by enhancing the transactivation of p-c-JUN through activating JNK signaling. Meanwhile, we also revealed that LINC00958 was transcriptionally regulated by c-JUN. In addition, earlier findings were also suitable for LUSC cells. By and large, our work illustrated that LINC00958 facilitates tumorigenesis in NSCLC by activating the JNK\/c-JUN signaling pathway, indicating a new road for diagnosis and treatment of both LUAD and LUSC.","1":null,"2":"The detailed characterization of biological nanoparticles is of paramount importance for various industrial sectors, as for production of viral therapeutics. More recently, technologies that allow real-time quantification with simultaneous sizing and determination of surface potentials of virus particles in solution have been developed. In this study, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was applied to determine the size and the zeta potential of human adenovirus type 5 (AdV5), one the most frequently used therapeutic\/oncolytic agents and viral vectors. Virus aggregation was detected, and the kinetics of the dissolution of virus aggregates were studied in real time. In addition, advanced fluorescence detection of AdV5 was performed enabling the measurements in matrices and discrimination of viral subpopulations. It was shown that NTA is an efficient approach for investigating infectious viruses in a live viewing mode. Consequently, NTA provides a promising methodology for virus particle detection and analysis in real time beyond assays requiring nucleic acids or infectivity.","3":"Viral vectors are complex drugs that pose a particular challenge for manufacturing. Previous studies have shown that, unlike small-molecule drugs, vector preparations do not yield a collection of identical particles. Instead, a mixture of particles that vary in capsid stoichiometry and impurities is created, which may differ from lot to lot. The consequences of this are unclear, but conflicting reports regarding the biological properties of vectors, including transduction patterns, suggest that this variability may have an effect. However, other variables, including differences in animal strains and techniques, make it difficult to identify a cause. Here, we report lot-to-lot variation in spinal cord gray matter transduction following intrathecal delivery of self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vectors. Eleven lots of vector were evaluated from six vector cores, including one preclinical\/Good Laboratory Practice lot. Eight of the lots, including the preclinical lot, failed to transduce the gray matter, whereas the other three provided robust transduction. The cause for this variation is unknown, but it did not correlate with vector titer, buffer, or purification method. These results highlight the need to identify the cause of this variation and to develop improved production and quality control methods to ensure lot-to-lot consistency of vector potency.","4":"Ongoing development of recombinant vectors based on adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is providing an increasingly powerful and widely used toolkit for gene transfer and genome editing applications. While conceptually simple, the system harbors considerable complexity that presents many potential pitfalls for the inexperienced user. The short inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) can prove to be particularly problematic during vector engineering due to inherent instability necessitating diligent quality control measures during vector manufacture. This is especially important from a clinical standpoint when consistent purity and potency are paramount, and all components of the system are rigorously scrutinized by regulatory agencies. Despite the discovery over 30 years ago that the AAV ITRs are the only cis-acting elements of the virus required for vector production, there is a scarcity of reviews specifically focused on these complex elements. This review provides an overview of the ITR with the dual purpose of acting as a user's guide in the application of AAV vector technology and as a roadmap for ongoing vector development and optimization.","5":null,"6":"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are excellent vectors for gene delivery. However, current Sf9\/Cap-Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac systems still lack versatility and flexibility for large-scale production of rAAVs. In this study, we developed an improved OneBac system that includes a novel dual-function baculovirus expression vector (BEV) termed BEV\/Cap-(ITR-GOI) that carries both the AAV Cap gene and rAAV genome inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences flanking the gene of interest (GOI), a versatile Sf9-GFP\/Rep packaging cell line that harbors silent copies of the AAV2 Rep gene that can be expressed after BEV infection, and constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes to facilitate cell line screening. The BEV\/Cap-(ITR-GOI) construct allows flexibility to switch among different Cap gene serotypes using simple BEV reconstruction, and is stable for at least five serial passages. Furthermore, the Sf9-GFP\/Rep stable cell line is versatile for production of different rAAV serotypes. The yield levels for rAAV2, rAAV8, and rAAV9 exceeded 105 vector genomes (VG) per cell, which is similar to other currently available large-scale rAAV production systems. The new Bac system-derived rAAVs have biophysical properties similar to HEK293 cell-derived rAAVs, as well as high quality and activity. In summary, the novel Sf9-GFP\/Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac system can facilitate large-scale rAAV production and rAAV-based gene therapy.","7":"Lentiviral vectors (LV) that are used in research and development as well as in clinical trials are in majority vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSVg) pseudotyped. The predominance of this pseudotype choice for clinical gene therapy studies is largely due to a lack of purification schemes for pseudotypes other than VSVg. In this study, we report for the first time the development of a new downstream process protocol allowing high-yield production of stable and infectious gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV)-TR-LV particles. We identified critical conditions in tangential flow filtration (TFF) and chromatographic steps for preserving the infectivity\/functionality of LV during purification. This was carried out by identifying for each step, the critical parameters affecting LV infectivity, including pH, salinity, presence of stabilizers, temperature, and by defining the optimal order of these steps. A three-step process was developed for GaLV-TR-LV purification consisting of one TFF and two chromatographic steps (ion-exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography) permitting recoveries of &gt;27% of infectious particles. With this process, purified GaLV-pseudotyped LV enabled the transduction of 70% human CD34+ cells in the presence of the Vectofusin-1 peptide, whereas in the same conditions nonpurified vector transduced only 9% of the cells (multiplicity of infection 20). Our protocol will allow for the first time the purification of GaLV-TR-LV that are biologically active, stable, and with sufficient recovery in the perspective of preclinical studies and clinical applications. Obviously, further optimizations are required to improve final vector yields.","8":"","9":"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene therapy is a fast-evolving field in the biotechnology industry. One of the major challenges in developing a purification process for AAV gene therapy is establishing an effective yet scalable method to remove empty capsids, or viral vectors lacking the therapeutic gene, from full capsids-viral product containing the therapeutic sequence. Several analytical methods that can quantify the empty-to-full capsid ratio have been reported in the literature. However, as samples can vary widely in viral titer, buffer matrix, and the relative level of empty capsids, understanding the specifications and limitations of different analytical methods is critical to providing appropriate support to facilitate process development. In this study, we developed a novel anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography assay to determine the empty-to-full capsid ratio of rAAV samples. The newly developed method demonstrated good comparability with both the transmission electron microscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation methods used in empty-to-full capsid ratio quantification, while providing much higher assay throughput and reducing the minimum sample concentration requirement to 2.7E11 viral genomes\/mL.","10":null,"11":"The study of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has for long been challenging due to the inability of clinical strains to efficiently proliferate in vitro until adaptive mutations occur. These mutations lead to strains that differ considerably from clinical isolates, many of them showing altered cell tropism, a decrease in cell association and higher susceptibility to an innate immune response. These problems were recently solved by the use of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors that allow for the conservation of an intact HCMV genome. Other characteristics that render HCMV difficult for in vitro study are related to its slow replication rate that leads to some constraints in its titration. During the cloning of HCMV into BAC vectors, many groups additionally inserted a fluorescent tag to facilitate the virus characterization. However, the methods used for titration of HCMV-BAC stocks are still relaying on the standard methods that are expensive and\/or time consuming. In this study, we assessed the possibility of viral titration by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), making use of the fluorescent tags that many of the HCMV-BACs hold. We compared viral titers obtained by immunohistochemistry with FACS, a faster and inexpensive technique. We showed that viral titers are comparable using the techniques already mentioned, and that titration by FACS is an efficient, fast, and cost-effective method. The establishment of viral titration of BAC vectors by FACS can further simplify the study of HCMV.","12":null,"13":null,"14":"Scalable lentiviral vector (LV) manufacturing is vital for successful commercialization of LV-based gene and cell therapy products. Accordingly, efforts are currently focused on developing and adapting technologies to address both upstream and downstream production bottlenecks. To overcome the limitations of current upstream processes, researchers are now favoring the use of bioreactors over traditional two-dimensional culture platforms. Bioreactors provide many advantages for manufacturing biomolecules, including process automation, tight regulation of production conditions, reduced labor input, and higher productivity potential. This study describes a transient LV production strategy employing a single-use, packed-bed bioreactor vessel. Functional LV titers in the 106 TU\/mL range were achieved, and after concentration yields of up to 109 TU\/mL were attained. This proof of principle study demonstrates that LV can be successfully produced in a packed-bed system. With further optimization, a packed-bed bioreactor could offer a potential scale-out solution for LV manufacturing.","15":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of X-linked recessive degenerative muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin (DMD) gene on the X chromosome. The DMD gene is complex, consisting of 79 exons, and mutations cause changes in the DMD mRNA so that the reading frame is altered, and the muscle-specific isoform of the dystrophin protein is either absent or truncated with variable residual function. The emerging CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing technique is being developed as a potential therapeutic approach to treat DMD because it can permanently replace the mutated dystrophin gene with the normal gene. Prenatal DNA testing can inform whether the female fetus is a carrier of DMD, and the male fetus has inherited a mutation from his mother (50% chance of both). This article summarizes the present status of current and future treatments for DMD.","16":null,"17":"Mutations in the human BEST1 gene are responsible for a number of distinct retinal disorders known as bestrophinopathies, for which there are no current treatments. The protein product, bestrophin-1, is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where it localizes to the basolateral membrane and acts as a Ca2+-activated chloride channel. Recent studies have shown successful BEST1-mediated gene transfer to the RPE, indicating human clinical trials of BEST1 gene therapy may be on the horizon. A critical aspect of such trials is the ability to assess the efficacy of vector prior to patient administration. Here, an assay is presented that enables the quantitative assessment of AAV-mediated BEST1 chloride conductance as a measure of vector efficacy. Expression of BEST1 following transduction of HEK293 cells with AAV.BEST1 vectors was confirmed by liquid chromatography, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. Whole-cell patch-clamp showed increased chloride conductance in BEST1-transduced cells compared to sham-transduced and untransduced controls. Exogenous chloride current correlated to BEST1 expression level, with an enhanced AAV.BEST1.WPRE vector providing higher expression levels of BEST1 and increases in chloride conductance. This study presents in vitro electrophysical quantification of bestrophin-1 following AAV-mediated gene transfer, providing vital functional data on an AAV gene therapy product that will support a future application for regulatory approval.","18":"Patients with preexisting anti-adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are currently excluded from AAV8 gene therapy trials. Therefore, the assessment of biologically relevant AAV8-NAb titers is critical for product development in gene therapy. However, standardized assays have not been routinely used to determine anti-AAV8-NAb titers, contributing to a wide range of reported anti-AAV8 prevalence rates. Using a clinical in vitro NAb assay in a separate study, a higher than expected anti-AAV8-NAb prevalence of about 50% was found in international cohorts. This comparative study has a translational character, confirming the biological relevance of anti-AAV8-antibody titers measured by this assay. The significance of low-titer anti-AAV8 NAbs is shown, along with the relevance of the in vitro assay cutoff (1:5) compared with other assays. Importantly, internally standardized reagents and purified AAV8 constructs containing 90% full capsids were used to reduce the effect of empty capsids. It was found that even very low anti-AAV8-NAb titers (&lt;1:5) could efficiently hinder transduction in vivo, demonstrating the importance of sensitive NAb assays for clinical applications. The in vitro NAb assay was found to be more sensitive than an in vivo NAb assay and thus more suitable for patient screening. Additionally, the study showed that anti-AAV8-NAb titers &lt;1:5 were very rare, further supporting the in vitro assay. However, assays using a lower cutoff may still be useful to explain potential variances in transgene expression. These findings support the relevance of the higher than expected prevalence of anti-AAV8 NAbs, highlighting the need for strategies to circumvent preexisting anti-AAV8 NAbs.","19":null,"20":"The aims of this study were to generate periodontal ligament (PDL) cells that have adenovirus- or lentivirus-mediated overexpression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and to compare the osteogenic and proliferative abilities of the two cell lines to establish an efficient and stable cell model that will be more suitable for studies of PDL regeneration. After construction of the recombinant adenovirus plasmid pAd-pshuttle-cmv-hTERT, human PDL cells were infected by packaged adenovirus and lentivirus particles to establish two PDL cell lines. The expression levels of hTERT and mRNA for alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, core-binding factor (runt-related transcription factor 2), and type I collagen were assessed for each cell line. After culture in osteoinductive culture medium for 14 days, the PDL cells were stained with alizarin red to observe formation of mineralized nodules, and proliferation activity was measured with a CCK-8 kit. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay indicated that the two transduced cell lines expressed hTERT levels that were significantly higher than that seen for normal PDL cells. Expression of all osteogenic genes tested, with the exception of osteopontin, was higher for both the adenovirus- and lentivirus-transduced cells relative to normal PDL cells. The expression of bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and runt-related transcription factor 2 in adenovirus-transduced cells was significantly higher than that for lentivirus-transduced cells. Alizarin red staining showed that the adenovirus-transduced cell line produced more mineralized nodules than the lentivirus-transduced cell line, whereas a CCK-8 test showed that the adenovirus-transduced cell line had higher proliferation activity than lentivirus-transduced cells. In conclusion, a PDL cell line established by adenovirus transduction had superior osteogenic differentiation and proliferative activity compared to the cell line produced by lentivirus transduction. The results indicate that PDL cells having adenovirus-mediated expression of hTERT would be a more suitable model for studies of PDL regeneration.","21":"As a nucleic acid alternative to traditional antibody, aptamer holds great potential in various fields of biology and medicine such as targeted gene therapy, drug delivery, bio-sensing, and laboratory medicine. Over the past decades, the conventional Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) method has undergone dramatic modifications and improvements owing to developments in material sciences and analytical techniques. However, many of the recently developed strategies either require complex materials and instruments or suffer from low efficiency and high failure rates in the selection of desired aptamers. Accordingly, the development of aptamers against new or novel targets is still a major obstacle for aptamer-based research and application. Here, an improved protein-SELEX procedure is presented for simplified and highly efficient isolation of aptamers against protein targets. Approaches are described that ensure a high success rate in aptamer selection by simplifying polymerase chain reaction procedures, introducing denature gel, utilizing an electro-elution-based single-stranded DNA separation strategy, as well as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based highly sensitive binding assay. In addition, a simplified sample preparation method for MiSeq-based next-generation sequencing is also introduced. While a recombinant protein as a bait protein for SELEX is discussed here, this protocol will also be invaluable for researchers wishing to develop aptamers against targets other than proteins such as small molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, cells, and micro-organisms for future gene therapy and\/or diagnostics.","22":null,"23":"The skin is considered as well suited for gene therapy and vaccination.

Here, an approach is presented that combines the use of a transgenic mouse line, expressing cre recombinase under a nestin promoter, with lentiviral delivery of a floxed, ivermectin (IVM)-gated chloride channel construct to the dentate gyrus. This approach was used to express an IVM-sensitive chloride channel in newly born granule cells in adult mouse brains, and its ability to silence neuronal activity was tested by analyzing the effect on immediate early gene expression in vitro in cre-transgenic primary neuronal cultures. IVM treatment of cells expressing the chloride channel prevented gabazine-induced expression of the immediate early gene product EGR1, while cells expressing a control inactive channel or no channel retained their EGR1 response. Thus, a genetic strategy is presented for targeting a specific neurogenic niche for transgene expression in the adult mouse brain, and proof of principle is shown that it can be used in vitro as a method for silencing neuronal activity.","25":"Gene therapy has great potential in treating human diseases, but little progress has been made in preclinical and clinical studies of renal diseases. To find an effective gene delivery approach in the kidney, transparenchymal renal pelvis injection was developed. Using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors, the gene delivery efficiency and safety of this administration method were evaluated. The results showed that the exogenous gene was expressed in the tubular epithelial cells of the injected kidney, with a much lower expression level in the contralateral kidney. Extra-renal transduction in the liver was also observed in this study, with the liver function of AAV9-injected mice comparable to that of control mice. Altogether, the administration of AAV9 vectors by newly established transparenchymal renal pelvis injection achieved the desired exogenous gene expression in renal tubular cells, and hence might be one possible way for gene therapy in renal diseases.","26":"Recombinant adeno associated viruses (rAAV) have become an important tool for the delivery of gene therapeutics due to long-standing safety and success in clinical trials. Since humans often become exposed to AAVs and develop anti-AAV antibodies (Abs), a potential impediment to the success of gene therapeutics is neutralization of the viral particle before it has had a chance to bind and enter target cells to release the transgene. Identification of subjects with preexisting Abs having neutralizing potential, and exclusion of such subjects from clinical studies is expected to enhance drug efficacy. In vitro cell-based reporter assays are most often employed to determine the level of neutralizing antibodies in a given population. Such assays measure the ability of the Abs to prevent viral binding and entry into cells by engaging epitopes on the viral capsid involved in host cell receptor binding. In general, cell-based assays are low throughput and labor intensive and may suffer from high variability and low sensitivity issues. In contrast, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are simpler, less variable, and have higher throughput. Demonstrating a correlation between neutralizing Abs assessed by a cell-based assay and total binding Abs measured in an ELISA will enable the use and substitution of the latter for screening and exclusion of subjects. In this work, we describe the development of a highly sensitive, specific, robust, and reproducible chemiluminescent ELISA method for the detection of total anti-AAV9 Abs. Using this method, we analyzed the prevalence of preexisting anti-AAV9 Abs in 100 serum samples from heart disease patients. Analysis of neutralizing Abs in the same samples using an in vitro cell-based assay showed a strong correlation between total anti-AAV9 Abs and neutralizing Abs, indicating the feasibility of using the total Ab ELISA in the future for patient screening and exclusion.","27":"The development of an ex vivo regional gene therapy clinical pathway using adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) may require cryopreservation for cell culture, storage, and transport prior to clinical use. ASCs isolated from five donors were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing BMP-2. Three groups were assessed: transduction without cell freezing (group 1), freezing of cells for 3 weeks followed by transduction (group 2), and cell transduction prior to freezing (group 3). Nontransduced cells were used as a control. The cluster of differentiation (CD) marker profiles, cell number, BMP-2 production, and osteogenic potential were measured. The CD marker profile (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105) was unchanged after cryopreservation. Cell number was equivalent among cryopreservation protocols in transduced and nontransduced cells. There was a trend toward decreased BMP-2 production in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2. Osteogenic potential based on Alizarin red concentration was higher in group 2 compared to group 3, with no difference compared to group 1. Freezing ASCs prior to transduction with a lentiviral vector containing BMP-2 has no detrimental effect on cell number, BMP-2 production, osteogenic potential, or immunophenotype. Transduction prior to freezing, however, may limit the BMP-2 production and potential osteogenic differentiation of the ASCs.","28":null,"29":"Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV2\/9) and pseudotype rhesus-10 (rAAV2\/rh10) are used for gene delivery, especially into the central nervous system. Both serotypes cross the blood-brain barrier and mediate stable long-term transduction in dividing and nondividing cells. Among possible routes of administration, intracardiac injection holds the potential for widespread vector diffusion associated with a relatively simple approach. In this study adopting the intracardiac route, we compare the cell-specific tropism and transfection efficacy of a panel of engineered rAAV2\/9 and rAAV2\/rh10 vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein. We observed transduction in the brain and peripherally, with a predominant neuronal tropism while the various serotypes achieved different expression patterns.","30":"Sequence validation of plasmid DNA is a crucial quality control step that must occur prior to adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector packaging through plasmid transfection. AAV cis-plasmids present unique challenges to sequence analysis, as they contain inverted terminal repeats and are prone to sequence rearrangements. An accurate and rapid next-generation sequencing approach has been established to analyze full-length sequences of AAV cis-plasmids within 3.5 days. Here, a step-by-step protocol is described that can reliably detect and identify the location and frequency of sequence variants commonly observed in AAV cis-plasmids.","31":"Intrathecal delivery of adeno-associated virus vectors and other therapeutics are currently being evaluated for the treatment of central nervous system sequelae of lysosomal storage diseases, motor neuron diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. As products transition from preclinical to clinical studies, a standardized and clinically relevant method of intrathecal delivery is increasingly germane. Here, we describe a method of intrathecal delivery via suboccipital puncture into the cisterna magna under fluoroscopic guidance in nonhuman primates. This procedure is suitable for use in good laboratory practice compliant studies, has an excellent safety profile, and is highly similar to the procedure currently being explored for use in humans.","32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":"This study explored the feasibility of intraparenchymal delivery (gadoteridol and\/or Serotype 5 Adeno-Associated Viral Vector-enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein [AAV5-eGFP]) into the cerebellum of nonhuman primates using real-time magnetic resonance imaging-guided convection enhanced delivery (MRI-CED) technology. All animals tolerated the neurosurgical procedure without any clinical sequela. Gene expression was detected within the cerebellar parenchyma at the site of infusion and resulted in transduction of neuronal cell bodies and fibers. Histopathology indicated localized damage along the stem of the cannula tract. These findings demonstrate the potential of real-time MRI-CED to deliver therapeutics into the cerebellum, which has extensive reciprocal connections and may be used as a target for the treatment of neurological disorders.","36":"The adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) Rep 78 protein, a strand-specific endonuclease (nickase) promotes site-specific integration of transgene sequences bearing homology arms corresponding to the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. To investigate the efficiency and specificity of this approach, plasmid-based donor vectors were tested in concert with nuclease encoding vectors, including an engineered version of the AAV2 Rep 78 protein, an AAVS1-specific zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), and the CRISPR-Cas9 components in HEK 293 cells. The Rep 78 and ZFN-based approaches were also compared in HEK 293 cells and in human induced pluripotent stem cells using integrase deficient lentiviral vectors. The targeting efficiencies involving the Rep 78 protein were similar to those involving the AAVS1-specific ZFN, while the targeting specificity for the Rep 78 protein was lower compared to that of the ZFN. It is anticipated that the Rep 78 nickase-based targeting approach may ultimately contribute to the reduction of risks associated with other genome editing approaches involving DNA double-strand breaks.","37":"To evaluate gene therapy for retinal disorders, appropriate models of the human eye are needed. Nonhuman primate eyes offer significant advantages over rodent eyes. However, current preparation methods have limitations. Here, a protocol is described for histological processing of nonhuman primate eyes after gene transfer. The user dissects unfixed eyes, flattens the globe parts within filter paper, and performs formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. This method obviates the need for harsh fixatives, allowing subsequent immunostaining or in situ hybridization while preserving tissue integrity for histopathological evaluation. Moreover, the straight orientation of the retinal cell layers is ideal for image analysis.","38":"Adenoviral vector (AdV) is one of the most used vectors in gene therapy clinical trials. However the therapeutic effect of AdV is limited due to preexisting immunity to the currently used human adenovirus type 5 and pre-decided vector tropism. It is highly demanded to develop novel AdVs originated from other types than adenovirus type 5. Here, we describe a method for direct cloning of adenovirus utilizing linear-linear homologous recombination, followed by rapid adenoviral genome modification via linear-circular homologous recombination. A plasmid bearing chosen adenoviral genome with the desired modification is generated in three weeks, from which a novel AdV can be reconstituted.","39":"The development of a drug product requires rigorous methods of characterization and quality control to assure drug potency. Gene therapy products, a relatively new strategy for drug design with very few licensed examples, represent a unique challenge for the measure of potency. Unlike traditional drugs, potency for a gene therapeutic is a tally of the measures of multiple steps, including infectivity, transcription, translation, protein modifications, proper localization of the protein product, and protein function. This is particularly challenging for products based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform, which has poor in vitro infectivity, limiting the sensitivity and thus the usefulness of cell-based assays. A rigorous in vivo assay has been established that separately evaluates infection, transcription, and resulting protein levels with specifications for each based on real time polymerase chain reaction (DNA and RNA) and standard protein assays. For an acceptance criterion, an administered vector must have vector DNA, transgene mRNA, and transgene expressed protein each concurrently meet individual specifications or the production lot fails. Using the AAVrh.10 serotype as a model vector and three different transgenes as examples, the assay is based on intravenous administration of the vector to male mice. At 2 weeks, the harvested liver is homogenized and assessed for vector genome levels (to assess for vector delivery), mRNA (to assess vector infectivity and transcription), and protein in the liver or serum (to assess protein expression). For all AAV vectors, the assay is robust and reproducible: vector DNA (linearity 102-109 copies, coefficient of variation) intra-assay &lt;0.8%, inter-assay &lt;0.5%; mRNA intra-assay &lt;3.3%, inter-assay &lt;3.4%. The reproducibility of the assay for transgene expressed protein is product specific. This in vivo potency assay is a strategy for characterization and a quantitative lot release test, providing a path forward to meet regulatory drug requirements for any AAV gene therapy vectors.","40":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy is being applied to treat a wide array of diseases. Preexisting host immune responses to AAV and immune responses elicited by AAV vector administration remain a problem that needs to be further studied. Here we present a series of protocols to assess immune responses before and after AAV vector administration that are applicable to multiple animal models and phase 1 clinical trials. More specifically, they may be use to evaluate (1) the humoral immune response, through levels of AAV-neutralizing and binding antibodies; (2) the innate immune response, through the acute induction of inflammatory cytokines; and (3) the T-cell immune response, through the activation of transgene- and vector-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.","41":null,"42":"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are the leading in vivo gene delivery platform, and have been extensively studied in gene therapy targeting various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). A single-bolus rAAV injection to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space has been widely used to target the CNS, but it suffers from several drawbacks, such as leakage to peripheral tissues. Here, a protocol is described using an osmotic pump to infuse rAAV slowly into the mouse CSF space. Compared to the single-bolus injection technique, pump infusion can lead to higher CNS transduction and lower transduction in the peripheral tissues.","43":"Lentivirus is one of the best vehicles in delivering exogenous genes for therapeutics. Prior to application, it is very important to determine the infectious titer, which measures only mature virus capable of infecting target cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting are commonly used for determination of infectious titer. This study introduces a new method based on Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR), a recently developed PCR technology that quantifies the absolute amount of target DNA in the reaction. In this study, the dynamic range, Limit of Quantification (LOQ), and data acceptance criteria for ddPCR are defined against lentiviral sequence. ddPCR performance is also compared to established FACS and qPCR methods. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of ddPCR in determining lentiviral infectious titer, but provides a detailed method that can be easily adapted by the scientific community.","44":"Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens are powerful tools to probe genetic dependencies in loss-of-function studies, such as the identification of therapeutic targets in cancer research. Lentivirally delivered shRNAs embedded in endogenous microRNA contexts (shRNAmiRs) mediate efficient long-term suppression of target genes suitable for numerous experimental contexts and clinical applications. Here, an easy-to-use laboratory protocol is described, covering the design and pooled assembly of focused shRNAmiR libraries into an optimized, Tet-inducible all-in-one lentiviral vector, packaging of viral particles, followed by retrieval and quantification of hairpin sequences after cellular DNA-recovery. Starting from a gene list to the identification of hits, the protocol enables shRNA screens within 6 weeks.","45":null,"46":"Lung cancer, caused mainly by smoking, is one of the most prevalent diseases in China, resulting in high mortality rates. The increasing incidence of chronic disease due to lung cancer places a huge burden on the welfare and cost to the Chinese society. Amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is associated with high incidence and mortality in lung cancer patients. FGFR1 signaling is implicated in oncogenic traits such as proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and migration. Targeting FGFR1 and its ligand basic FGF (bFGF) is a key step forward in developing new therapies for this crippling disease. Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer. In this study, A549, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line widely used in vitro as a model for drug metabolism and as a transfection host, was used to study FGFR1. A stable lentiviral FGFR1 over-expression system in lung cancer cells is described for the study of anti-lung cancer drug candidates targeting FGFR1. Ligand binding to FGFR1 activates the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling pathway and increases adhesion, invasion, and migration in this model. Using a unique FGF monoclonal antibody developed in the laboratory, the overactive PI3K pathway was effectively blocked, abrogating the negative metastatic signaling pathways in lung cancer cells. Importantly, this model provides an effective and simple screening kit for anti-FGF1 drug compounds for lung cancer treatment and a tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the FGFR1 signaling pathway in lung cancer. Furthermore, this toolkit based on a FGFR1 lentiviral construct model is transferrable to study FGFR1 signaling in any type of cancer cell.","47":"Lentiviral vectors are used in laboratories around the world for in vivo and ex vivo delivery of gene therapies, and increasingly clinical investigation as well as preclinical applications. The third-generation lentiviral vector system has many advantages, including high packaging capacity, stable gene expression in both dividing and post-mitotic cells, and low immunogenicity in the recipient organism. Yet, the manufacture of these vectors is challenging, especially at high titers required for direct use in vivo, and further challenges are presented by the process of translating preclinical gene therapies toward manufacture of products for clinical investigation. The goals of this paper are to report the protocol for manufacturing high-titer third-generation lentivirus for preclinical testing and to provide detailed information on considerations for translating preclinical viral vector manufacture toward scaled-up platforms and processes in order to make gene therapies under Good Manufacturing Practice that are suitable for clinical trials.","48":"Vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSVg) is extensively used for retroviral and lentiviral vector (LV) pseudotyping. However, VSVg pseudotyped vectors are serum inactivated, blocking the in vivo gene delivery. Several strategies have been employed to prevent complement inactivation, including chemical and genetic envelope modifications. This study employed the streptococcal albumin-binding domain (ABD) to generate a construct to express ABD as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. LV particles bearing ABD are able to bind bovine and human serum albumin in vitro. Neither the lentiviral vector production titer nor the in vitro transduction was affected by the ABD display. The study demonstrated that ABD-bearing LVs are protected from human complement inactivation. More importantly, intravenous administration demonstrated that the presence of ABD significantly reduces lentivector sequestration in liver and bone-marrow cells. Therefore, the use of ABD represents an improvement for in vivo gene therapy applications. The results strongly point to ABD display as a universal strategy to increase the in vivo efficacy of different viral vectors.","49":null,"50":"Adeno-associated virus vectors are a powerful tool for gene transfer approaches. We have established a simple and fast plasmid-based production system for achieving high adeno-associated virus titers within 6 working days. The same procedure can be used for all serotypes and thus allows direct comparability of different serotypes. In this protocol we describe a step-by-step procedure that results in well-characterized vectors suitable for both in vitro approaches and preclinical studies.","51":null,"52":"Viruses have evolved specialized molecular mechanisms to transfer their genome efficiently into host cells. Viruses can be repurposed into viral vectors to achieve controlled gene transfer to desired cells. One of the most popular classes of vectors, lentiviral vectors (LVs), transduce mammalian cells efficiently. LVs are pseudotyped with various heterologous viral envelopes to alter their tropism. While the most common example is the envelope glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG), many other viral proteins have also been used. Pseudotyping LVs with a diverse set of naturally occurring or engineered viral envelopes has allowed targeted transduction of specific cell types. Many exciting studies are further uncovering new specificities and shortcomings of pseudotyped LVs. These studies will expand the toolbox to make LVs that cater to the specific requirements of transduction. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various viral envelope pseudotypes used with LVs, their specificities, advantages, and drawbacks.","53":null,"54":null,"55":"Transduction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with lentiviral vectors (LVs) constitutes a new therapeutic option for the treatment of various monogenic diseases affecting the lymphohematopoietic system. The development of detailed preclinical studies of gene therapy in animal disease models constitutes an essential step in expanding the application of gene therapy in a wide variety of inherited and acquired diseases. Here we describe an efficient protocol to transduce HSPCs from wild-type and Fanconi anemia mice with either gene-marking or therapeutic LVs. In this protocol, purified lineage-, Sca-1+, c-Kit+ bone marrow cells were transduced in vitro for a short period of time under conditions that facilitated efficient transduction of HSPCs capable of engrafting in transplanted recipients.","56":null,"57":"Lentiviral vectors are increasingly the gene transfer tool of choice for gene or cell therapies, with multiple clinical investigations showing promise for this viral vector in terms of both safety and efficacy. The third-generation vector system is well characterized, effectively delivers genetic material and maintains long-term stable expression in target cells, delivers larger amounts of genetic material than other methods, is nonpathogenic, and does not cause an inflammatory response in the recipient. This report aims to help academic scientists and regulatory managers negotiate the governance framework to achieve successful translation of a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy. The focus is on European regulations and how they are administered in the United Kingdom, although many of the principles will be similar for other regions, including the United States. The report justifies the rationale for using third-generation lentiviral vectors to achieve gene delivery for in vivo and ex vivo applications; briefly summarizes the extant regulatory guidance for gene therapies, categorized as advanced therapeutic medicinal products (ATMPs); provides guidance on specific regulatory issues regarding gene therapies; presents an overview of the key stakeholders to be approached when pursuing clinical trials authorization for an ATMP; and includes a brief catalogue of the documentation required to submit an application for regulatory approval of a new gene therapy.","58":"Lentivirus-based vectors have been used for the development of potent gene therapies. Here, application of a multigenic lentiviral vector (LV) producing multiple anti-angiogenic microRNAs following subretinal delivery in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mouse model is presented. This versatile LV, carrying back-to-back RNApolII-driven expression cassettes, enables combined expression of microRNAs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) mRNA and fluorescent reporters. In addition, by including a vitelliform macular dystrophy 2 (VMD2) promoter, expression of microRNAs is restricted to the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Six days post injection (PI), robust and widespread fluorescent signals of eGFP are already observed in the retina by funduscopy. The eGFP expression peaks at day 21 PI and persists with stable expression for at least 9 months. In parallel, prominent AsRED co-expression, encoded from the VMD2-driven microRNA expression cassette, is evident in retinal sections and flat-mounts, revealing RPE-specific expression of microRNAs. Furthermore, LV-delivered microRNAs targeting the Vegfa gene in RPE cells reduced the size of laser-induced CNV in mice 28 days PI, as a consequence of diminished VEGF levels, suggesting that LVs delivered locally are powerful tools in the development of gene therapy-based strategies for treatment of age-related macular degeneration.","59":null,"60":"Gene therapy is a rapidly evolving field. So far, there have been &gt;2,400 gene therapy products in clinical trials and four products on the market. A prerequisite for producing gene therapy products is ensuring their quality and safety. This requires appropriately controlled and standardized production and testing procedures that result in consistent safety and efficacy. Assuring the quality and safety of lentivirus-based gene therapy products in particular presents a great challenge because they are cell-based multigene products that include viral and therapeutic proteins as well as modified cells. In addition to the continuous refinement of a product, changes in production sites and manufacturing processes have become more and more common, posing challenges to developers regarding reproducibility and comparability of results. This paper discusses the concept of developing a first World Health Organization International Standard, suitable for the standardization of assays and enabling comparison of cross-trial and cross-manufacturing results for this important vector platform. The standard will be expected to optimize the development of gene therapy medicinal products, which is especially important, given the usually orphan nature of the diseases to be treated, naturally hampering reproducibility and comparability of results.","61":null,"62":"The RNA interference pathway is an evolutionary conserved post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanism that is exclusively triggered by double-stranded RNA inducers. RNAi-based methods and technologies have facilitated the discovery of many basic science findings and spurred the development of novel RNA therapeutics. Transient induction of RNAi via transfection of synthetic small interfering RNAs can trigger the selective knockdown of a target mRNA. For durable silencing of gene expression, either artificial short hairpin RNA or microRNA encoding transgene constructs were developed. These miRNAs are based on the molecules that induce the natural RNAi pathway in mammals and humans: the endogenously expressed miRNAs. Significant efforts focused on the construction and delivery of miRNA cassettes in order to solve basic biology questions or to design new therapy strategies. Several viral vectors have been developed, which are particularly useful for the delivery of miRNA expression cassettes to specific target cells. Each vector system has its own unique set of distinct properties. Thus, depending on the specific application, a particular vector may be most suitable. This field was previously reviewed for different viral vector systems, and now the recent progress in the field of miRNA-based gene-silencing approaches using lentiviral vectors is reported. The focus is on the unique properties and respective limitations of the available vector systems for miRNA delivery.","63":"Multimodal lentiviral vectors (LVs) allow switching between constitutive and tetracycline-regulated gene co-expressions in genetically modified cells. Transduction of murine primary hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) with multimodal LVs in the absence of doxycycline ensures the constitutive expression of gene of interest 1 (GOI1) only. In the presence of doxycycline, induced tetracycline-regulated expression of a second GOI (GOI2) allows evaluation of the collaboration between two genes. Drug removal retains constitutive expression, which allows the contribution of an individual gene into created networks to be studied. Doxycycline-dependent switching can be tracked via fluorescent markers coupled to constitutive and tetracycline-regulated GOIs. This article describes transduction of murine primary HPCs with different doses of multimodal LVs, distinct cytokine conditions, and their influence on the number and viability of cells co-expressing both collaborating GOIs upon doxycycline induction. A 2-week protocol is provided for multimodal LV production, titer determination, and evaluation of tetracycline responsive promoter background activity in a murine fibroblast cell line. The power of this model to assess the dose\/time\/order-controlled contribution of single and multiple genes into hematopoietic networks opens new routes in reprogramming, stem cell, and leukemia biology.","64":"The requirement for robust analytical methods to characterize adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is immediate, as the field advances more AAV gene therapies into the clinic and onto commercialization. AAV capsid proteins (VPs) are critical for viral infectivity and vector potency. Thus, complete characterization of the constituent viral capsid proteins of AAV vectors, including their sequences and post-translational modifications (PTMs), is highly recommended to ensure AAV product quality and consistency. Typically, SDS-PAGE analysis followed by in-gel enzymatic digestion and liquid chromatography\/tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) is used for the characterization of viral capsid proteins. However, due to the limited recovery of digested peptides from the gel, determination of N-terminal sequences of VPs has not been reported to date. In this study, a direct liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) intact protein analysis was developed to characterize viral capsid proteins in a variety of AAV serotypes. Both N- and C-terminal sequences of six AAV serotypes have been identified based on accurate mass measurement. This method can be used to confirm the identity of AAV serotype and monitor potential capsid protein heterogeneity. Complete sequence confirmation of AAV2 VPs was achieved through LC\/MS\/MS analysis of peptides generated using multiple enzymatic digestions. LC\/MS\/MS analysis confirmed the sequences for both N- and C-termini of capsid VPs and revealed acetylation on the N-termini of VP1 and VP3, consistent with LC\/MS intact protein analysis.","65":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) producer cell lines are created via transfection of HeLaS3 cells with a single plasmid containing three components (the vector sequence, the AAV rep and cap genes, and a selectable marker gene). As this plasmid contains both the cis (Rep binding sites) and trans (Rep protein encoded by the rep gene) elements required for site-specific integration, it was predicted that plasmid integration might occur within the AAVS1 locus on human chromosome 19 (chr19). The objective of this study was to investigate whether integration in AAVS1 might be correlated with vector yield. Plasmid integration sites within several independent cell lines were assessed via Southern, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR analyses. In the Southern analyses, the presence of fragments detected by both rep- and AAVS1-specific probes suggested that for several mid- and high-producing lines, plasmid DNA had integrated into the AAVS1 locus. Analysis with puroR and AAVS1-specific probes suggested that integration in AAVS1 was a more widespread phenomenon. High-producing AAV2-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) lines (masterwell 82 [MW82] and MW278) were evaluated via FISH using probes specific for the plasmid, AAVS1, and a chr19 marker. FISH analysis detected two plasmid integration sites in MW278 (neither in AAVS1), while a total of three sites were identified in MW82 (two in AAVS1). An inverse PCR assay confirmed integration within AAVS1 for several mid- and high-producing lines. In summary, the FISH, Southern, and PCR data provide evidence of site-specific integration of the plasmid within AAVS1 in several AAV producer cell lines. The data also suggest that integration in AAVS1 is a general phenomenon that is not necessarily restricted to high producers. The results also suggest that plasmid integration within the AAVS1 locus is not an absolute requirement for a high vector yield.","66":"Increasing interest and application of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) in basic and clinical research have urged efforts to improve rAAV production quality and yield. Standard vector production workflows call for genome titration of purified vectors at the endpoint of production to assess yield. Unfortunately, quality control measures for preparations during mid-production steps and economical means to assess the fidelity of multiple batches of rAAV preparations are lacking. Here we describe a scalable and accurate method for the direct quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) titration of rAAV genomes in crude lysate. Lysate samples are pretreated with DNase I to remove vector and packaging plasmid DNAs, followed by proteinase K to release endonuclease-resistant packaged viral genomes and to proteolyze factors inherent to crude lysates that can impinge upon quantitative PCR efficiencies. We show that this method is precise, scalable, and applicable for vector genome titrations of both single-stranded and self-complementary AAV genomes irrespective of serotype differences-a major limitation for standard lysate transduction methods that indirectly screen for vector packaging efficiency. Our described method therefore represents a significant improvement to rAAV vector production in terms of alleviating time and cost burdens, in-process quality control assessment, batch\/lot monitoring in large-scale preparations, and good manufacturing practices.","67":null,"68":"A set of vectors for Cre recombinase-dependent expression of the hybrid suicidal FCU1 transgene was constructed, including a two-plasmid system wherein the FCU1 and Cre transgenes reside in separate vectors, and single-plasmid variants in which a single plasmid bears both transgenes. To improve the safety profile and specificity in cancer gene therapy applications, as well as to ensure stable propagation of plasmids in bacterial cells, the Cre\/LoxP system components were optimized. A bicistronic vector with the Cre expression cassette placed between the LoxP sites unidirectionally with FCU1 cDNA resulted in higher therapeutic efficiency compared with the double-plasmid system in an enzyme-prodrug suicide cancer gene therapy scheme. Therefore, the feasibility of a single-plasmid approach in the development of cancer gene therapy with hierarchical enhancement of therapeutic transgene expression has been demonstrated.","69":"","70":"Lentivirus-mediated transduction of autologous T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to confer a desired epitope specificity as a targeted immunotherapy for cancer has been among the first human gene therapy techniques to demonstrate widespread therapeutic efficacy. Other approaches to using gene therapy to enhance antitumor immunity have been less specific and less effective. These have included amplification, marking, and cytokine transduction of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, recombinant virus-based expression of tumor antigens as a tumor vaccine, and transduction of antigen-presenting cells with tumor antigens. Unlike any of those methods, the engineering of CAR T cells combine specific monoclonal antibody gene sequences to confer epitope specificity and other T-cell receptor and activation domains to create a self-contained single vector approach to produce a very specific antitumor response, as is seen with CD19-directed CAR T cells used to treat CD19-expressing B-cell malignancies. Recent success with these therapies is the culmination of a long step-wise iterative process of improvement in the design of CAR vectors. This review aims to summarize this long series of advances in the development of effective CAR vector since their initial development in the 1990s, and to describe emerging approaches to design that promise to enhance and widen the human gene therapy relevance of CAR T-cell therapy in the future.","71":"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as one of the most popular gene transfer systems in both research and clinical gene therapy. As AAV vectors are derived from a stealth, nonpathogenic virus and lack active integrase activity, these vectors are frequently applied for in vivo gene therapy of liver, muscle, and other postmitotic tissues. Although long-term transgene expression from AAV vector episomes is reported from these tissues, the episomal nature of AAV-once regarded as disadvantage-has become an attractive feature for gene-editing approaches targeting proliferating cells. In response to the high demand, AAV vector production is receiving special attention. Besides particle yields and biological activity, the most important concern is improving vector purity. The most difficult task in this regard is removal of defective particles, that is, capsids that are either empty or contain DNA other than the full-length vector genomes. Herein, we characterize and discuss these so-called product-related impurities, methods for their detection, as well as strategies to avoid or reduce their formation.","72":null,"73":null,"74":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a very promising gene therapy vector.

In addition, the manufacturing process must ensure high vector quality and biological safety. The OneBac system offers easily scalable rAAV vector production in insect Sf9-derived AAV rep\/cap-expressing producer cell lines infected with a single baculovirus that carries the rAAV backbone. For most AAV serotypes high burst sizes per cell were achieved, combined with high infectivity rates. OneBac 2.0 represents a 2-fold advancement: First, enhanced VP1 proportions in AAV5 capsids lead to vastly increased per-particle infectivity rates. Second, collateral packaging of foreign DNA is suppressed by removal of the Rep-binding element (RBE). In this study we show that this advancement of AAV5 packaging can be translated to OneBac 2.0-derived packaging systems for alternative AAV serotypes. By removal of the RBE, collateral packaging of nonvector DNA was drastically reduced in all newly tested serotypes (AAV1, AAV2, and AAV8). However, the splicing-based strategy to enhance VP1 expression in order to increase AAV5 infectivity hardly improved infectivity rates of AAV-1, -2, or -8 compared with the original OneBac cell lines. Our results emphasize that OneBac 2.0 represents an advancement for scalable, high-titer production of various AAV serotypes, leading to AAV particles with minimal packaging of foreign DNA.","80":null,"81":"The use of lentiviral vectors (LVs) for gene transfer in research, technological, or clinical applications requires the production of large amounts of vector. Mass production of clinical-grade LVs remains a challenge and limits certain perspectives for therapeutic use. Some improvements in LV production protocols have been possible by acting on multiple steps of the production process. The addition of animal-derived cholesterol to the culture medium of producer cells is known to increase the infectivity of LVs. To avoid the use of this animal-derived product in clinical settings, an alternative approach is to increase de novo the production of cholesterol by overexpressing a crucial cholesterogenic enzyme, namely, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). This project evaluates the impact of such an approach on the production, infectivity, and stability of LVs. We demonstrated that the overexpression of human HMGCR isoform 1 (hHMGCR1) in LV producer cells efficiently increased de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and enhanced by 2- to 3-fold the physical and infectious titers of LVs. We also observed that LVs produced in hHMGCR1-overexpressing cells were comparable in stability to LVs produced under classical conditions and were capable of transducing human CD34+ hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells efficiently. Interestingly, we also showed that LV production in the absence of fetal calf serum (FCS) but under hHMGCR1-overexpressing conditions allowed a viral production yield comparable to that achieved under classical conditions in high FCS content, leading the way to the establishment of new LV production protocols on adherent cells without serum.","82":null,"83":"There is an unmet need for improved therapeutics for colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy only marginally improves survival in some patients and has no benefit in others, underscoring the clinical opportunity for novel immunotherapeutic approaches to improve survival in colorectal cancer. In that context, guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) is an established biomarker and therapeutic target for metastatic colorectal cancer with immunological characteristics that promote durable antitumor efficacy without autoimmunity. Preliminary studies established non-replicating human type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) expressing GUCY2C as safe and effective to induce GUCY2C-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in mice. This study characterized the biodistribution, immunogenicity, and safety of a vector expressing GUCY2C fused with the human CD4+ T helper cell epitope PADRE (Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE) to advance this vaccine into clinical trials in colorectal cancer patients. Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE levels were highest in the injection site and distributed in vivo primarily to draining lymph nodes, the liver, spleen and, unexpectedly, to the bone marrow. Immune responses following Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE administration were characterized by PADRE-specific CD4+ T-cell and GUCY2C-specific B-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses, producing antitumor immunity targeting GUCY2C-expressing colorectal cancer metastases in the lungs, without acute or chronic autoimmune or other toxicities. Collectively, these data support Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE as a safe and effective vaccination strategy in preclinical models and position Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE for Phase I clinical testing in colorectal cancer patients.","84":"The treatment of B-cell malignancies by adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CD19 CAR-T) has proven to be a highly successful therapeutic modality in several clinical trials.1-6 The anti-CD19 CAR-T cell production method used to support initial trials relied on numerous manual, open process steps, human serum, and 10 days of cell culture to achieve a clinical dose.7 This approach limited the ability to support large multicenter clinical trials, as well as scale up for commercial cell production. Therefore, studies were completed to streamline and optimize the original National Cancer Institute production process by removing human serum from the process in order to minimize the risk of viral contamination, moving process steps from an open system to functionally closed system operations in order to minimize the risk of microbial contamination, and standardizing additional process steps in order to maximize process consistency. This study reports a procedure for generating CD19 CAR-T cells in 6 days, using a functionally closed manufacturing process and defined, serum-free medium. This method is able to produce CD19 CAR-T cells that are phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from cells produced for clinical trials by the previously described production process.","85":"Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have shown potential in the treatment of a myriad of diseases; however, infusion of cells alone is unlikely to provide the full range of potential therapeutic applications. Transient genetic manipulation of ASCs could increase their repair and regeneration characteristics in a disease-specific context, essentially transforming them into drug-eluting depots. The goal of this study was to determine the optimal parameters necessary to transduce ASCs with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), an approved gene therapy vector that has never been associated with disease. Transduction and duration of gene expression of the most common recombinant AAV vectors were tested in this study. Among all tested serotypes, rAAV5 resulted in both the highest and longest term expression. Furthermore, we determined the glycosylation profile of ASCs before and after neuraminidase treatment and demonstrate that rAAV5 transduction requires plasma membrane-associated sialic acid. Future studies will focus on the optimization of gene delivery to ASCs, using rAAV5 as the vector of choice, to drive biological drug delivery, engraftment, and disease correction.","86":"Stable gene transfer into target cell populations via integrating viral vectors is widely used in stem cell gene therapy (SCGT). Accurate vector copy number (VCN) estimation has become increasingly important. However, existing methods of estimation such as real-time quantitative PCR are more restricted in practicality, especially during clinical trials, given the limited availability of sample materials from patients. This study demonstrates the application of an emerging technology called droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in estimating VCN states in the context of SCGT. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease were used as clonable target cells for transduction with alpharetroviral vectors harboring codon-optimized CYBB cDNA. Precise primer-probe design followed by multiplex analysis conferred assay specificity. Accurate estimation of per-cell VCN values was possible without reliance on a reference standard curve. Sensitivity was high and the dynamic range of detection was wide. Assay reliability was validated by observation of consistent, reproducible, and distinct VCN clustering patterns for clones of transduced iPSCs with varying numbers of transgene copies. Taken together, use of ddPCR appears to offer a practical and robust approach to VCN estimation with a wide range of clinical and research applications.","87":"Adipose tissue plays a pivotal role, both in the regulation of energy homeostasis and as an endocrine organ. Consequently, adipose tissue dysfunction is closely related to insulin resistance, morbid obesity, and metabolic syndrome.

Here, we report on adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors as a versatile tool to transduce human mature adipocytes in organotypic three-dimensional tissue cultures.","88":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, genetic muscle disease caused by the absence of the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin. Gene replacement therapy is considered a potential strategy for the treatment of DMD, aiming to restore the missing protein. Although the elements of the dystrophin molecule have been identified and studies in transgenic mdx mice have explored the importance of a number of these structural domains, the resulting modified dystrophin protein products that have been developed so far are only partially characterized in relation to their structure and function in vivo. To optimize a dystrophin cDNA construct for therapeutic application we designed and produced four human minidystrophins within the packaging capacity of lentiviral vectors. Two novel minidystrophins retained the centrally located neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-anchoring domain in order to achieve sarcolemmal nNOS restoration, which is lost in most internally deleted dystrophin constructs. Functionality of the resulting truncated dystrophin proteins was investigated in muscle of adult dystrophin-deficient mdx mice followed by a battery of detailed immunohistochemical and morphometric tests. This initial assessment aimed to determine the overall suitability of various constructs for cloning into lentiviral vectors for ex vivo gene delivery to stem cells for future preclinical studies.","89":"Adenovirus (Ad) is used extensively for construction of viral vectors, most commonly with deletion in its E1 and\/or E3 genomic regions. Previously, our attempts to insert envelope proteins (Env) of HIV-1 into such vectors based on chimpanzee-derived Ad (AdC) viruses were thwarted. Here, we describe that genetic instability of an E1- and E3-deleted AdC vector of serotype C6 expressing Env of HIV-1 can be overcome by reinsertion of E3 sequences with anti-apoptotic activities. This partial E3 deletion presumably delays premature death of HEK-293 packaging cell lines due to Env-induced cell apoptosis. The same partial E3 deletion also allows for the generation of stable glycoprotein 140 (gp140)- and gp160-expressing Ad vectors based on AdC7, a distinct AdC serotype. Env-expressing AdC vectors containing the partial E3 deletion are genetically stable upon serial cell culture passaging, produce yields comparable to those of other AdC vectors, and induce transgene product-specific antibody responses in mice. A partial E3 deletion thereby allows expansion of the repertoire of transgenes that can be expressed by Ad vectors.","90":"","91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a promising vector for retinal gene delivery to restore visual function in certain forms of inherited retinal dystrophies. Several studies in rodent models have shown that intravitreal injection of the AAV2\/2 vector is the optimal route for efficient retinal ganglion cell (RGC) transduction. However, translation of these findings to larger species, including humans, is complicated by anatomical differences in the eye, a key difference being the comparatively smaller volume of the vitreous chamber in rodents. Here, we address the role of the vitreous body as a potential barrier to AAV2\/2 diffusion and transduction in the RGCs of dogs and macaques, two of the most relevant preclinical models. We intravitreally administered the AAV2\/2 vector carrying the CMV-eGFP reporter cassette in dog and macaque eyes, either directly into the vitreous chamber or after complete vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous body. Our findings suggest that the vitreous body appears to trap the injected vector, thus impairing the diffusion and transduction of AAV2\/2 to inner retinal neurons. We show that vitrectomy before intravitreal vector injection is an effective means of overcoming this physical barrier, improving the transduction of RGCs in dog and macaque retinas. These findings support the use of vitrectomy in clinical trials of intravitreal gene transfer techniques targeting inner retinal neurons.","96":"Polyethylenimine-based polyplexes are promising nonviral gene delivery systems for preclinical and clinical applications. Pipette-based polyplexing is associated with several disadvantages, such as batch-to-batch variability, restriction to smaller volumes, and variable gene delivery results. The present protocol describes syringe-pump-mediated upscaled synthesis of well-defined gene delivery nanoparticles capable of efficient in vitro and in vivo gene delivery. Syringe-pump-based synthesis ensures controlled mixing, upscaling, and reproducible gene delivery. Nanoparticle tracking analysis of the upscaled formulations involved single nanoparticle tracking, thereby generating highly resolved biophysical characterization. Gene delivery performance was investigated by luciferase gene expression in cells and three-dimensional bioluminescence imaging in mice.","97":null,"98":"Cardiac gene therapy is a promising approach for treating heart diseases. Although clinical studies are ongoing, effective and targeted transgene delivery is still a major obstacle. We sought to improve and direct transgene expression in myocardium by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD). In pigs, adeno-associated virus-derived (AAV) vectors harboring the luciferase reporter gene were delivered via retroinfusion into the anterior interventricular coronary vein (AIV). AAV vectors were either loaded to lipid microbubbles before injection or injected unmodified. Upon injection of AAV\/microbubble solution, UTMD was performed. After 4 weeks, reporter gene expression levels in the anterior wall (target area), in the posterior wall (control area), and in noncardiac organs were analyzed. Retroinfusion of AAV-luciferase vectors loaded to lipid microbubbles led to a significant increase in transgene expression, with an increase in UTMD targeted areas of the anterior wall. Moreover, off-target expression was reduced in comparison to control animals, receiving AAV-luciferase without microbubbles. Besides an increase in overall target area transgene expression, UTMD alters the spatial expression of the luciferase transgene, focusing expression to ultrasound-targeted left ventricular wall. These data suggest UTMD as a promising approach for directing AAV to specific cardiac segments. ","99":"The present study was designed to visualize the cellular trafficking of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in general and AAV5 serotype vectors in particular. We fluorescently labeled AAV5 wild-type and a mutant (S652A) virus and studied their infection process by live cell imaging and confocal microscopy. Our data demonstrate considerable difference in the ability of these vectors to reach the nuclear compartment within the first 6 hr after infection.","100":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by retinal microvascular changes caused by chronic exposure to hyperglycemia, leading to low tissue oxygenation and ultimately to neovascularization. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy are the most efficient treatments for DR, but display severe side effects such as the destruction of the healthy retina. Another clinical approach uses antiangiogenic agents to prevent and delay progression of neovascularization, but these require recurrent local administrations that increase the possibility of retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and cataract formation. Studies in human diabetic retinas have revealed an imbalance between proangiogenic factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and antiangiogenic factors, such as pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF). This imbalance favors pathological angiogenesis contributing to DR, and can constitute a therapeutic target. Gene therapy was recently shown to be an adequate intervention for long-term treatment of several retinal pathologies. We have previously shown the newly engineered episomal vector pEPito to be able of sustained gene expression in the mouse retina. We here show that pEPito was able to overexpress PEDF for up to three months, both in in vitro cultures of human retinal pigment epithelial cells and in the retina of diabetic mice after a single subretinal injection. In vivo, in parallel with the increase in PEDF we observed a decrease in VEGF levels in injected compared with noninjected eyes and a significant effect on two hallmarks of DR: reduction of glucose transport (by glucose transporter GLUT1), and reduction of inflammation by decreased reactivity of microglia. Jointly, these results point to a significant therapeutic potential of gene therapy with pEPito-PEDF for the treatment of DR. ","101":"We have developed retroviral replicating vectors (RRV) derived from Moloney murine gammaretrovirus with an amphotropic envelope and an encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-transgene cassette downstream of the env gene. During long-term (180 days) replication of the vector in animals, a bulge of 7 adenosine residues (A's) in the J-K bifurcation domain sometimes serially added A's. Therefore, vectors with 4-12 A's in the A bulge in the J-K bifurcation domain were generated, and the impact of the variants on transgene protein expression, vector stability, and IRES sequence upon multiple infection cycles was assessed in RRV encoding yeast-derived cytosine deaminase and green fluorescent protein in vitro. For transgene protein expression, after multiple infection cycles, RRV-IRES with 5-7 A's gave roughly comparable levels, 4 and 8 A's were within about 4-5-fold of the 6 A's, whereas 10 and 12 A's were marked lower. In terms of stability, after 10 infection cycles, expansion of A's appeared to be a more frequent event affecting transgene protein expression than viral genome deletions or rearrangement: 4 and 5 A's appeared completely stable; 6, 7, and particularly 8 A's showed some level of expansion in the A bulge; 10 and 12 A's underwent both expansion and transgene deletion. The strong relative translational activity of the 5 A's in the EMCV IRES has not been reported previously. The 5A RRV-IRES may have utility for preclinical and clinical applications where extended replication is required. ","102":"The first human gene therapy trials using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors were performed in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Over 100 CF patients were enrolled in 5 separate trials of rAAV2-CFTR administration via nasal, endobronchial, maxillary sinus, and aerosol delivery. Recombinant AAV vectors were designed to deliver the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene and correct the basic CFTR defect by restoring chloride transport and reverting the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. However, vector DNA expression was limited in duration because of the low incidence of integration and natural airway epithelium turnover. In addition, repeated administration of AAV-CFTR vector resulted in a humoral immune response that prevented effective gene transfer from subsequent doses of vector. AAV serotype 2 was used in human trials before the comparison with other serotypes and determination that serotypes 1 and 5 not only possess higher tropism for the airway epithelium, but also are capable of bypassing the binding and trafficking processes-both were important hindrances to the effectiveness of rAAV2. Although rAAV-CFTR gene therapy does not appear likely to supplant newer small-molecule CFTR modulators in the near future, early work with rAAV-CFTR provided an important foundation for later use of rAAV in humans. ","103":"The ability to efficiently produce large amounts of high-titer recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a prerequisite to the continued success of AAV as a gene therapy tool targeted toward large-animal preclinical studies or human clinical therapeutics. Current manufacturing procedures necessitate laborious and time-consuming purification procedures to obtain AAV particles of sufficient titer and purity for these demanding biomedical applications. The finding that AAV can be harvested and purified from producer cell medium may represent an efficient alternative to purifying AAV from cellular lysates. Here we sought to determine the maximum duration of time, and frequency within which AAV can be harvested from producer cell medium, in order to maximize the yield obtained from a single transfection preparation. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with polyethylenimine to produce AAV2\/5 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cellular medium was harvested every 2 days until a maximum duration of 19 days posttransfection. AAV2\/5-GFP was released into producer cell medium at a steady state until 7 days posttransfection, at which time titers dropped dramatically. Harvesting medium every two days resulted in the maximum yield of AAV from a single preparation, and the cumulative yield of AAV harvested from the producer cell medium was 4-fold higher than the yield obtained from a traditional purification of AAV from cellular lysates. The AAV2\/5 harvested from medium within the 7-day collection time-course mediated high levels of transduction in vivo, comparable to AAV2\/5 harvested from cellular lysates. AAV purified from cell lysates showed increasing amounts of empty particles at 5 and 7 days posttransfection, whereas AAV purified from cell medium did not show an increase in the amount of empty particles throughout the 7-day time course. Finally, we extended these findings to AAV2\/9, demonstrating that a comparable ratio of AAV2\/9 particles are also released for up to 7 days posttransfection.

The production of clinical-grade rAAV vectors for gene therapy would benefit from analytical methods that are able to monitor drug product quality with regard to homogeneity, purity, and manufacturing consistency. Here, we demonstrate the novel application of analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to characterize the homogeneity of preparations of rAAV vectors. We show that a single sedimentation velocity run of rAAV vectors detected and quantified a number of different viral species, such as vectors harboring an intact genome, lacking a vector genome (empty particles), and containing fragmented or incomplete vector genomes. This information is obtained by direct boundary modeling of the AUC data generated from refractometric or UV detection systems using the computer program SEDFIT. Using AUC, we show that multiple parameters contributed to vector quality, including the AAV genome form (i.e., self-complementary vs. single-stranded), vector genome size, and the production and purification methods. Hence, AUC is a critical tool for identifying optimal production and purification processes and for monitoring the physical attributes of rAAV vectors to ensure their quality.

Here, by performing short-pulse laser pretreatment on the mouse retina, we demonstrate RPE cells transduced by three different capsid types of AAV vectors, AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8, using RPE wholemounts. For all capsid types, laser pretreatment effectively induced the transduction of RPE cells in and around the laser site.

These molecules offer an interesting alternative to silencing approaches that are based on shRNAs and siRNAs because they present the same efficiency as these options and are less cytotoxic. amiRNAs have mostly been applied to gene knockdown in plants; they have been examined to a lesser extent in animal cells. Therefore, this article reviews the amiRNAs that have been developed for animal cells and focuses on the miRNA scaffolds that can already be applied to construct the artificial counterparts, as well as on the different approaches that have been described to promote amiRNA expression and silencing efficiency. Furthermore, the availability of amiRNA libraries and other tools that can be used to design and construct these molecules is briefly discussed, along with an overview of the therapeutic applications for which amiRNAs have already been evaluated.

In this study, we used core proteins of HBV, which is modified with RGD peptides, to construct a biomimetic vector for the delivery of Pokemon siRNAs (namely, RGD-HBc-Pokemon siRNA). Quantitative PCR and Western blot assays revealed that RGD-HBc-Pokemon siRNA possessed the highest efficiency of Pokemon suppression in HCC cells. In vitro experiments further indicated that RGD-HBc-Pokemon-siRNA exerted a higher tumor suppressor activity on HCC cell lines, evidenced by reduced proliferation and attenuated invasiveness, than Pokemon-siRNA or RGD-HBc alone. Finally, animal studies demonstrated that RGD-HBc-Pokemon siRNA suppressed the growth of HCC xenografts in mice by a greater extent than Pokemon-siRNA or RGD-HBc alone.

Thus, we compared the potential usefulness of various serotypes of recombinant AAV vectors and lentiviral vectors for gene transfer to human skin in a xenotransplanted mouse model. Vector constructs encoding firefly luciferase were packaged in AAV capsids of serotype 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 and separately administered by intradermal injection in human skin transplants. For all serotypes, live bioimaging demonstrated low levels of transgene expression in the human skin graft, and firefly luciferase expression was observed primarily in neighboring tissue outside of the graft. In contrast, gene delivery by intradermally injected lentiviral vectors was efficient and led to extensive and persistent firefly luciferase expression within the human skin graft only.

To stimulate in vivo reprogramming to dopaminergic neurons, we generated a Rosa26 knock-in mouse line conditionally overexpressing Mash1, Lmx1a, and Nurr1. These proteins are characterized by their role in neuronal commitment and development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and have previously been shown to convert fibroblasts to dopaminergic neurons in vitro. We show that a tricistronic construct containing these transcription factors can reprogram astrocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. However, cassette overexpression triggered cell death in vivo, in part through endoplasmic reticulum stress, while we also detected \"uncleaved\" forms of the polyprotein, suggesting poor \"cleavage\" efficiency of the 2A peptides. Based on our results, the cassette overexpression induced apoptosis and precluded reprogramming in our mouse model.

For the purification procedure of HCAdV, cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation is usually performed followed by buffer exchange using dialysis or comparable methods. However, performing these steps is technically difficult, potentially error-prone, and not scalable. Here, we establish a new protocol for small-scale production of HCAdV based on commercially available adenovirus purification systems and a standard method for the quality control of final HCAdV preparations. For titration of final vector preparations, we established a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) that uses a standard free-end-point PCR in small droplets of defined volume. By using different probes, this method is capable of detecting and quantifying HCAdV and HV in one reaction independent of reference material, rendering this method attractive for accurately comparing viral titers between different laboratories. In summary, we demonstrate that it is possible to produce HCAdV in a small scale of sufficient quality and quantity to perform experiments in cell culture, and we established a reliable protocol for vector titration based on ddPCR.

We have developed a rapid and inexpensive method for measuring clone size based on random shearing of genomic DNA, minimal exponential PCR amplification, and shear site counts as a quantitative endpoint. This quantitative shearing linear amplification PCR (qsLAM PCR) assay utilizes an internal control sample containing 19 lentiviral insertion sites per cell that is mixed with polyclonal samples derived from transduced human CD34+ cells. Samples were analyzed from transplanted pigtail macaques and from a participant in our X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) lentiviral vector trial and yielded controlled and quantitative results in all cases. One case of early clonal dominance was detected in a monkey transplanted with limiting numbers of transduced HSCs, while the clinical samples from the XSCID trial participant showed highly diverse clonal representation. These studies demonstrate that qsLAM PCR is a facile and quantitative assay for measuring clonal repertoires in subjects enrolled in human gene therapy trials using lentiviral-transduced HSCs.

Electroporation is a physical delivery method that potentiates the uptake of DNA vaccines into target cells. Intradermal electroporation offers a minimally invasive solution to DNA delivery in the clinic. Here we describe the direct transfection of dendritic cells in the epidermis, using a surface dermal electroporation device, and specifically show a dendritic cell transfected with plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein. The dendritic cell has used its motile capabilities after transfection to move from the epidermis into the dermis, making its way to the lymphatic system.","136":"Therapy with autologous T cells that have been gene-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) or T cell receptors (TCR) provides a feasible and broadly applicable treatment for cancer patients. In a clinical study in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with CAR T cells specific for carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), we observed toxicities that (most likely) indicated in vivo function of CAR T cells as well as low T cell persistence and clinical response rates. The latter observations were confirmed by later clinical trials in other solid tumor types and other gene-modified T cells. To improve the efficacy of T cell therapy, we have redefined in vitro conditions to generate T cells with young phenotype, a key correlate with clinical outcome. For their impact on gene-modified T cell phenotype and function, we have tested various anti-CD3\/CD28 mAb-based T cell activation and expansion conditions as well as several cytokines prior to and\/or after gene transfer using two different receptors: CAIX CAR and MAGE-C2(ALK)\/HLA-A2 TCR. In a total set of 16 healthy donors, we observed that T cell activation with soluble anti-CD3\/CD28 mAbs in the presence of both IL15 and IL21 prior to TCR gene transfer resulted in enhanced proportions of gene-modified T cells with a preferred in vitro phenotype and better function. T cells generated according to these processing methods demonstrated enhanced binding of pMHC, and an enhanced proportion of CD8+, CD27+, CD62L+, CD45RA+T cells. These new conditions will be translated into a GMP protocol in preparation of a clinical adoptive therapy trial to treat patients with MAGE-C2-positive tumors.","137":null,"138":null,"139":"High numbers of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) equipped with enhanced engrafting potential are required for successful stem cell gene therapy. By using thalassemia as a model, we investigated the functional properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from Hbb(th3)\/45.2(+) mice after mobilization with G-CSF, plerixafor, or G-CSF+plerixafor and the engraftment kinetics of primed cells after competitive primary and noncompetitive secondary transplantation. G-CSF+plerixafor yielded the highest numbers of HSPCs, while G-CSF+plerixafor-mobilized Hbb(th3)\/45.2(+) cells, either unmanipulated or transduced with a reporter vector, achieved faster hematologic reconstitution and higher levels of donor chimerism over all other types of mobilized cells, after competitive transplantation to B6.BoyJ\/45.1(+) recipients. The engraftment benefit observed in the G-CSF+plerixafor group was attributed to the more primitive stem cell phenotype of G-CSF+plerixafor-LSK cells, characterized by higher CD150(+)\/CD48 expression. Moreover, secondary G-CSF+plerixafor recipients displayed stable or even higher chimerism levels as compared with primary engrafted mice, thus maintaining or further improving engraftment levels over G-CSF- or plerixafor-secondary recipients. Plerixafor-primed cells displayed the lowest competiveness over all other mobilized cells after primary or secondary transplantation, probably because of the higher frequency of more actively proliferating LK cells. Overall, the higher HSC yields, the faster hematological recovery, and the superiority in long-term engraftment indicate G-CSF+plerixafor-mobilized blood as an optimal graft source, not only for thalassemia gene therapy, but also for stem cell gene therapy applications in general.","140":null,"141":"Polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins (PPRHs) are formed by two intramolecularly bound antiparallel homopurine domains linked by a five-thymidine loop. One of the homopurine strands binds with antiparallel orientation by Watson-Crick bonds to the polypyrimidine target sequence, forming a triplex. We had previously reported the ability of PPRHs to effectively bind dsDNA displacing the fourth strand away from the newly formed triplex. The main goal of this work was to explore the possibility of repairing a point mutation in mammalian cells using PPRHs as tools. These repair-PPRHs contain different combinations of extended sequences of DNA with the corrected nucleotide to repair the point mutation. As a model we used the dihydrofolate reductase gene. On the one hand, we demonstrate in vitro that PPRHs bind specifically to their polypyrimidine target sequence, opening the two strands of the dsDNA, and allowing the binding of a given repair oligonucleotide to the displaced strand of the DNA. Subsequently, we show at a cellular level (Chinese ovary hamster cells) that repair-PPRHs are able to correct a single-point mutation in a dihydrofolate reductase minigene bearing a nonsense mutation, both in an extrachromosomal location and when the mutated plasmid was stably transfected into the cells. Finally, this methodology was successfully applied to repair a single-point mutation at the endogenous locus, using the DA5 cell line with a deleted nucleotide in exon six of the dhfr gene.","142":"Limiting factors in large preclinical and clinical studies utilizing adeno-associated virus (AAV) for gene therapy are focused on the restrictive packaging capacity, the overall yields, and the versatility of the production methods for single AAV vector production. Furthermore, applications where multiple vectors are needed to provide long expression cassettes, whether because of long cDNA sequences or the need of different regulatory elements, require that each vector be packaged and characterized separately, directly affecting labor and cost associated with such manufacturing strategies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method of vector production that allows for the packaging of multiple expression cassettes in a single transfection step. Here we combined two expression cassettes in predetermined ratios before transfection and empirically demonstrate that the output vector recapitulates the predicted ratios. Titration by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of AAV vector genome copies using shared or unique genetic elements allowed for delineation of the individual vector contribution to the total preparation that showed the predicted differential packaging outcomes. By copackaging green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry constructs, we demonstrate that both vector genome and infectious titers reiterated the ratios utilized to produce the constructs by transfection. Copackaged therapeutic constructs that only differ in transcriptional elements produced a heterogeneous vector population of both constructs in the predefined ratios. This study shows feasibility and reproducibility of a method that allows for two constructs, differing in either transgene or transcription elements, to be efficiently copackaged and characterized simultaneously, reducing cost of manufacturing and release testing.","143":null,"144":null,"145":null,"146":"The Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) DNA transposons represent an emerging new gene delivery technology, potentially suitable for human gene therapy applications. Previous studies pointed to important differences between these transposon systems, depending on the cell types examined and the methodologies applied. However, efficiencies cannot always be compared because of differences in applications. In addition, \"overproduction inhibition,\" a phenomenon believed to be a characteristic of DNA transposons, can remarkably reduce the overall transgenic rate, emphasizing the importance of transposase dose applied. Therefore, because of lack of comprehensive analysis, researchers are forced to optimize the technology for their own \"in-house\" platforms. In this study, we investigated the transposition of several SB (SB11, SB32, SB100X) and PB (mPB and hyPB) variants in various cell types at three levels: comparing the excision efficiency of the reaction by real-time PCR, testing the overall transgenic rate by detecting cells with stable integrations, and determining the average copy number when using different transposon systems and conditions. We concluded that high excision activity is not always followed by a higher transgenic rate, as exemplified by the hyperactive transposases, indicating that the excision and the integration steps of transposition are not strongly coupled as previously thought. In general, all levels of transposition show remarkable differences depending on the transposase used and cell lines examined, being the least efficient in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In spite of the comparably low activity in those special cell types, the hyperactive SB100X and hyPB systems could be used in hESCs with similar transgenic efficiency and with reasonably low (2-3) transgene copy numbers, indicating their potential applicability for gene therapy purposes in the future.","147":"Numerous strategies targeting early and late steps of the HIV life cycle have been proposed for gene therapy. However, targeting viral and host determinants of HIV entry is the only strategy that would prevent viral DNA-mediated CD4(+) cell death while diminishing the possibility for the virus to escape. To this end, we devised a bicistronic lentiviral vector expressing the membrane-bound form of the T20 fusion inhibitor, referred to as the C46 peptide, and a CCR5 superagonist, modified to sequester CCR5 away from the cell surface, referred to as the P2-CCL5 intrakine. We tested the effects of the vector on HIV infection and replication, using the human CEMR5 cell line expressing CD4 and CCR5, and primary human T cells. Transduced cells expressed the C46 peptide, detected with the 2F5 monoclonal antibody by flow cytometry. Expression of the P2-CCL5 intrakine correlates with lower levels of cell surface CCR5. Complete protection against HIV infection could be observed in cells expressing the protective transgenes. Importantly, we show that the combination of the transgenes was more potent than either transgene alone, showing the interest of expressing two entry inhibitors to inhibit HIV infection. Last, genetically modified cells possessed a selective advantage over nonmodified cells on HIV challenge in vitro, showing that modified cells were protected from HIV-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate that lentiviral vectors coexpressing the T20 fusion inhibitor and the P2-CCL5 intrakine represent promising tools for HIV gene therapy.","148":"Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for HIV\/AIDS is a promising alternative to lifelong antiretroviral therapy. One of the limitations of this approach is the number and quality of stem cells available for transplant following in vitro manipulations associated with stem cell isolation and genetic modification. The development of methods to increase the number of autologous, gene-modified stem cells available for transplantation would overcome this barrier. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) from adult growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood were cultured in the presence of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist (AhRA) previously shown to expand HSPC from umbilical cord blood. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the hematopoietic potential of minimally cultured (MC-HSPC) or expanded HSPC (Exp-HSPC) was performed using an immunodeficient mouse model of transplantation. Our results demonstrate robust, multilineage engraftment of both MC-HSPC and Exp-HSPC although estimates of expansion based on stem cell phenotype were not supported by a corresponding increase in in vivo engrafting units. Bone marrow of animals transplanted with either MC-HSPC or Exp-HSPC contained secondary engrafting cells verifying the presence of primitive stem cells in both populations. However, the frequency of in vivo engrafting units among the more primitive CD34+\/CD90+ HSPC population was significantly lower in Exp-HSPC compared with MC-HSPC. Exp-HSPC also produced fewer lymphoid progeny and more myeloid progeny than MC-HSPC. These results reveal that in vitro culture of adult HSPC in AhRA maintains but does not increase the number of in vivo engrafting cells and that HSPC expanded in vitro contain defects in lymphopoiesis as assessed in this model system. Further investigation is required before implementation of this approach in the clinical setting.","149":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles inside the nucleus of a HEK 293 cell are shown by electron microscopy.

However, previous methods either had limited efficacy or required viral vectors, which hinder clinical application. In this study, we aimed to establish an efficient method of insulin-secreting cell generation from NEPEC without viral vectors. We used nonislet fractions from both research-grade human pancreata from brain-dead donors and clinical pancreata after total pancreatectomy with autologous islet transplantation to treat chronic pancreatitis. It is of note that a few islets could be mingled in the nonislet fractions, but their influence could be limited. The NeuroD1 gene was induced into NEPEC using an effective triple lipofection method without viral vectors to generate insulin-secreting cells. The differentiation was promoted by adding a growth factor cocktail into the culture medium. Using the research-grade human pancreata, the effective method showed high efficacy in the differentiation of NEPEC into insulin-positive cells that secreted insulin in response to a glucose challenge and improved diabetes after being transplanted into diabetic athymic mice. Using the clinical pancreata, similar efficacy was obtained, even though those pancreata suffered chronic pancreatitis. In conclusion, our effective differentiation protocol with triple lipofection method enabled us to achieve very efficient insulin-secreting cell generation from human NEPEC without viral vectors. This method offers the potential for supplemental insulin-secreting cell transplantation for both allogeneic and autologous islet transplantation.","151":null,"152":null,"153":null,"154":null,"155":"Wild-type Sindbis virus (SV) shows promise as an oncolytic agent, although potential off-target replication is a safety concern. To remove possible pathology reflecting virus replication in liver, muscle, and\/or hematopoietic cells, microRNA (miR)-response elements (MREs) to liver-specific miR122, muscle-specific miR133a and miR206, or hematopoietic-specific miR142-3p were inserted into the Sindbis viral genome. We compared the effectiveness of MREs in two distinct genomic locations and found better tissue-specific attenuation when they were inserted into the structural polyprotein coding region (up to 6000-fold selectivity with miR142-3p) rather than into the 3' untranslated region (up to 850-fold with miR142-3p). While this degree of tissue-specific attenuation may be effective for relieving pathology in vivo, genetic instability of RNA viruses raises concerns over the mutation or loss of MREs conferring safety. Genetically modified SVs containing a reporter transgene, used as a surrogate for virus replication, mutated quickly in vitro, losing 50% transgene sequence within 6.2 passages. Using a shorter insert containing MREs but no transgene, complete genetic stability was observed over at least 10 passages. We conclude that SV may be genetically modified to improve clinical properties, but attention must be paid to ensure that genetic stability is sufficient for intended applications.","156":null,"157":"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a prime cell source for pharmacological research and regenerative therapies because of their extensive expansion potential and their ability to differentiate into essentially all somatic lineages in vitro. Improved methods to stably introduce multiple transgenes into hPSCs will promote, for example, their preclinical testing by facilitating lineage differentiation and purification in vitro and the subsequent in vivo monitoring of respective progenies after their transplantation into relevant animal models. To date, the establishment of stable transgenic hPSC lines is still laborious and time-consuming. Current limitations include the low transfection efficiency of hPSCs via nonviral methods, the inefficient recovery of genetically engineered clones, and the silencing of transgene expression. Here we describe a fast, electroporation-based method for the generation of multitransgenic hPSC lines by overcoming the need for any preadaptation of conventional hPSC cultures to feeder-free conditions before genetic manipulation. We further show that the selection for a single antibiotic resistance marker encoded on one plasmid allowed for the stable genomic (co-)integration of up to two additional, independent expression plasmids. The method thereby enables the straightforward, nonviral generation of valuable multitransgenic hPSC lines in a single step. Practical applicability of the method is demonstrated for antibiotic-based lineage enrichment in vitro and for sodium iodide symporter transgene-based in situ cell imaging after intramyocardial cell infusion into explanted pig hearts.","158":"","159":"The presence of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) in lentiviral vector preparations is a major safety concern for clinical applications of such vectors. RCL are believed to emerge from rare recombinant vector genomes that are referred to as partial recombinants or Psi-Gag recombinants. To quantitatively determine the fraction of partial recombinants in lentiviral vector preparations and to analyze them at the DNA sequence level, we established a drug selection assay involving a lentiviral packaging construct containing a drug-resistance gene encoding blasticidin (BSD) resistance. Upon transduction of target cells, the BSD resistance gene confers BSD resistance to the transduced cells. The results obtained indicate that there were up to 156 BSD-resistant colonies in a total of 10(6) transducing vector particles. The predicted recombination events were verified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA obtained from BSD-resistant cell clones and by DNA sequence analysis. In an attempt to reduce the emergence of partial recombinants, sequence overlaps between the packaging and the vector constructs were reduced by substituting the Rev response element (RRE) present in the vector construct using a heterologous RRE element derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239). The results obtained showed that a reduction of sequence overlaps resulted in an up to sevenfold reduction of the frequency of BSD-resistant colonies, indicating that the capacity to form partial recombinants was diminished.","160":"Genome engineering can be accomplished by designer nucleases. They are specifically designed to cleave double-stranded DNA at the desired target locus. This double-strand break subsequently engages the DNA repair pathway through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), resulting in either gene disruption or gene repair. Alternatively, the presence of homologous donor DNA allows for targeted integration of this exogenous donor DNA in this target locus through homology-directed DNA repair. The key bottleneck in genome engineering relates to the delivery and expression of the designer nucleases. One of the most attractive vector platforms for genome engineering is based on integration-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs). The intrinsic episomal nature of IDLVs is well suited to ensure transient expression of designer nucleases and minimize potential risks associated with their sustained expression. Unfortunately, their expression is compromised because of epigenetic silencing that interferes with the transcriptional competence of IDLVs. In this issue, Pelascini and colleagues now showed that this bottleneck could be overcome by interfering with chromatin remodeling using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. HDAC inhibition restored expression of designer nucleases from IDLVs and rescued their ability to achieve efficient targeted gene disruption by NHEJ comparable with that achieved with bona fide integrating lentiviral vectors. This study has implications for the ex vivo use of IDLVs for gene repair and gene targeting.","161":"Accurate titration of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector genome copies is critical for ensuring correct and reproducible dosing in both preclinical and clinical settings. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the current method of choice for titrating AAV genomes because of the simplicity, accuracy, and robustness of the assay. However, issues with qPCR-based determination of self-complementary AAV vector genome titers, due to primer-probe exclusion through genome self-annealing or through packaging of prematurely terminated defective interfering (DI) genomes, have been reported. Alternative qPCR, gel-based, or Southern blotting titering methods have been designed to overcome these issues but may represent a backward step from standard qPCR methods in terms of simplicity, robustness, and precision. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a new PCR technique that directly quantifies DNA copies with an unparalleled degree of precision and without the need for a standard curve or for a high degree of amplification efficiency; all properties that lend themselves to the accurate quantification of both single-stranded and self-complementary AAV genomes. Here we compare a ddPCR-based AAV genome titer assay with a standard and an optimized qPCR assay for the titration of both single-stranded and self-complementary AAV genomes. We demonstrate absolute quantification of single-stranded AAV vector genomes by ddPCR with up to 4-fold increases in titer over a standard qPCR titration but with equivalent readout to an optimized qPCR assay. In the case of self-complementary vectors, ddPCR titers were on average 5-, 1.9-, and 2.3-fold higher than those determined by standard qPCR, optimized qPCR, and agarose gel assays, respectively. Droplet digital PCR-based genome titering was superior to qPCR in terms of both intra- and interassay precision and is more resistant to PCR inhibitors, a desirable feature for in-process monitoring of early-stage vector production and for vector genome biodistribution analysis in inhibitory tissues.","162":null,"163":null,"164":"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have great potential for personalized regenerative medicine. Although several different methods for generating iPS cells have been reported, improvement of safety and efficiency is imperative. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using a triple tyrosine mutant AAV2 (Y444+500+730F) vector, designated AAV2.3m, to generate iPS cells. We developed a polycistronic rAAV2.3m vector expressing three reprogramming factors, Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2, and then used this vector to infect mouse adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) to induce the generation of iPS cells. We demonstrated that (1) the triple tyrosine mutant AAV2 vector is able to reprogram mouse adult adipose tissue-derived stem cells into the pluripotent state. Those rAAV2.3m-derived iPS (rAAV2.3m-iPS) cells express endogenous pluripotency-associated genes including Oct4, Sox2, and SSEA-1, and form teratomas containing multiple tissues in vivo; (2) c-myc, an oncogene, is dispensable in rAAV2.3m-mediated cellular reprogramming; and (3) transgene expression is undetectable after reprogramming, whereas vector DNA is detectable, indicating that transgenes are silenced. These results indicated the rAAV vector may have some advantages in generating iPS cells.","165":"An ideal novel treatment for bone defects should provide regeneration without autologous or allogenous grafting, exogenous cells, growth factors, or biomaterials while ensuring spatial and temporal control as well as safety. Therefore, a novel osteoinductive nonviral in vivo gene therapy approach using sonoporation was investigated in ectopic and orthotopic models. Constitutive or regulated, doxycycline-inducible, bone morphogenetic protein 2 and 7 coexpression plasmids were repeatedly applied for 5 days. Ectopic and orthotopic gene transfer efficacy was monitored by coapplication of a luciferase plasmid and bioluminescence imaging. Orthotopic plasmid DNA distribution was investigated using a novel plasmid-labeling method. Luciferase imaging demonstrated an increased trend (61% vs. 100%) of gene transfer efficacy, and micro-computed tomography evaluation showed significantly enhanced frequency of ectopic bone formation for sonoporation compared with passive gene delivery (46% vs. 100%) dependent on applied ultrasound power. Bone formation by the inducible system (83%) was stringently controlled by doxycycline in vivo, and no ectopic bone formation was observed without induction or with passive gene transfer without sonoporation. Orthotopic evaluation in a rat femur segmental defect model demonstrated an increased trend of gene transfer efficacy using sonoporation. Investigation of DNA distribution demonstrated extensive binding of plasmid DNA to bone tissue. Sonoporated animals displayed a potentially increased union rate (33%) without extensive callus formation or heterotopic ossification. We conclude that sonoporation of BMP2\/7 coexpression plasmids is a feasible, minimally invasive method for osteoinduction and that improvement of bone regeneration by sonoporative gene delivery is superior to passive gene delivery.","166":null,"167":null,"168":"The adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector has emerged as an attractive vector for gene therapy applications. Development of AAV vectors with enhanced gene transduction efficiency is important to ease the burden of AAV production and minimize potential immune responses. Rational mutations on AAV capsids have gained attention as a simple method of enhancing AAV transduction efficiency. A single-amino acid mutation, K137R, on AAV1 and AAV8 was recently reported to increase liver transgene expression by 5-10-fold. To determine whether the same mutation on other AAV serotypes would result in similar gene enhancement effects, K137R mutants were generated on AAV7, AAV8, and AAV9, and their effects were evaluated in vivo. Two reporter genes were utilized: the nuclear LacZ gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter and the luciferase gene driven by the CB promoter. Surprisingly, we found no difference in luciferase gene expression in the liver or other tissues using either the wild-type AAV8 capsid or AAV8-K137R. LacZ gene expression in the liver by AAV8-K137R was about onefold higher than that of wild-type AAV8. However, no difference was found in other tissues, such as skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. In addition, no difference was found in transgene expression with either AAV7-K137R or AAV9-K137R mutants. Our results indicated that the K137R mutation on AAV7, AAV8, and AAV9 had minimal to no effect on transduction efficiency in vivo.","169":null,"170":"RNA silencing is an established method for investigating gene function and has attracted particular interest because of the potential for generating RNA-based therapeutics.

In this review we provide an overview of both lentiviral vectors and RNA silencing along with design considerations for generating lentiviral vectors capable of RNA silencing. We go on to describe the current preclinical data regarding lentiviral vector-mediated RNA silencing for CNS disorders and discuss the concerns of side effects associated with lentiviral vectors and small interfering RNAs and how these might be mitigated.","171":"The mammalian homolog of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor atonal-1 (Atoh1 or Math1) is required for development of cochlear hair cells that function as the mechanosensory cells required for audition. Forced expression of Atoh1 in cochlear-supporting cells may provide a way to regenerate hair cells and provide for a therapy for hearing loss. Additionally, Atoh1 is an inhibitor of proliferation and has further clinical applications in anticancer therapies. The goal of these experiments was to improve the method for Atoh1 expression by engineering a genetic construct that may be used in future translational applications. To address the poor control of Atoh1 expression in standard gene expression systems where Atoh1 is expressed constitutively at abnormally elevated levels, our aim was to engineer an inducible system whereby Atoh1 was upregulated by an inducer and downregulated once the inducer was removed. A further aim was to engineer a single genetic construct that allowed for conditional expression of Atoh1 independent of secondary regulatory elements. Here we describe a stand-alone genetic construct that utilizes the tamoxifen sensitivity of a mutated estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain for the conditional expression of Atoh1. The Atoh1-ER-DsRed construct is translated into an ATOH1-ER-DSRED fusion protein that remains sequestered in the cytoplasm and therefore rendered inactive because it cannot enter the nucleus to activate Atoh1 signaling pathways. However, application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen results in translocation of the fusion protein to the nucleus, where it binds to the Atoh1 enhancer, upregulates transcription and translation of endogenous ATOH1 and activates downstream Atoh1 signaling such as upregulation of the hair cell protein MYOSIN 7A. Removal of tamoxifen reverses the upregulation of endogenous Atoh1 signaling. This construct serves as an independent genetic construct that allows for the conditional upregulation and downregulation of Atoh1, and may prove useful for manipulating Atoh1 expression in vivo.","172":"Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) work as dimers to induce double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at predefined chromosomal positions. In doing so, they constitute powerful triggers to edit and to interrogate the function of genomic sequences in higher eukaryotes. A preferred route to introduce ZFNs into somatic cells relies on their cotransduction with two integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) each encoding a monomer of a functional heterodimeric pair. The episomal nature of IDLVs diminishes the risk of genotoxicity and ensures the strict transient expression profile necessary to minimize deleterious effects associated with long-term ZFN activity. However, by deploying IDLVs and conventional lentiviral vectors encoding HPRT1- or eGFP-specific ZFNs, we report that DSB formation at target alleles is limited after IDLV-mediated ZFN transfer. This IDLV-specific underperformance stems, to a great extent, from the activity of chromatin-remodeling histone deacetylases (HDACs). Importantly, the prototypic and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of metal-dependent HDACs, trichostatin A and vorinostat, respectively, did not hinder illegitimate recombination-mediated repair of targeted chromosomal DSBs. This allowed rescuing IDLV-mediated site-directed mutagenesis to levels approaching those achieved by using their isogenic chromosomally integrating counterparts. Hence, HDAC inhibition constitutes an efficacious expedient to incorporate in genome-editing strategies based on transient IDLV-mediated ZFN expression. Finally, we compared two of the most commonly used readout systems to measure targeted gene knockout activities based on restriction and mismatch-sensitive endonucleases. These experiments indicate that these enzymatic assays display a similar performance.","173":"The clinical potential of chimeric antigen receptors in adoptive cellular therapy is beginning to be realized with several recent clinical trials targeting CD19 showing promising results in advanced B cell malignancies. This increased efficacy corresponds with improved engineering of the chimeric receptors with the latest-generation receptors eliciting greater signaling and proliferation potential. However, the antigen-binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain of the receptors is critical in determining the activity of the chimeric receptor-expressing T cells, as this determines specificity and affinity to the tumor antigen. In this study, we describe a mammalian T cell line screening protocol employing a 2A-based bicistronic retroviral vector to isolate functional scFvs. This approach involves expression of the scFv library in a chimeric antigen receptor, and is based on selection of clones capable of stimulating CD69 upregulation in a T cell line and has a number of advantages over previously described methods in that the use of a 2A cassette ensures the exclusion of nonexpressing scFvs and the screening using a chimeric receptor in a mammalian T cell line ensures selection in the optimum context for therapeutic use. Proof-of-principle experiments show that the protocol was capable of a 10(5)-fold enrichment of positive clones after three rounds of selection. Furthermore, an antigen-specific clone was successfully isolated from a partially enriched scFv library, confirming the strength of the protocol. This approach has the potential to identify novel scFvs of use in adoptive T cell therapy and, potentially, wider antibody-based applications.","174":"The contamination of adenovirus (Ad) stocks with adeno-associated viruses (AAV) is usually unnoticed, and it has been associated with lower Ad yields upon large-scale production. During Ad propagation, AAV contamination needs to be detected routinely by polymerase chain reaction without symptomatic suspicion. In this study, we describe that the coinfection of either Ad wild type 5 or oncolytic Ad with AAV results in a large-plaque phenotype associated with an accelerated release of Ad from coinfected cells. This accelerated release was accompanied with the expected decrease in Ad yields in two out of three cell lines tested. Despite this lower Ad yield, coinfection with AAV accelerated cell death and enhanced the cytotoxicity mediated by Ad propagation. Intratumoral coinjection of Ad and AAV in two xenograft tumor models improved antitumor activity and mouse survival. Therefore, we conclude that accidental or intentional AAV coinfection has important implications for Ad-mediated virotherapy.","175":"The diaphragm is the most important inspiratory muscle in all mammals, and ventilatory insufficiency caused by diaphragm dysfunction is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many genetic and acquired diseases affecting skeletal muscle. Currently, pharmacological inhibitors, genetically modified animals, and invasive procedures are used to study disorders affecting the diaphragm. However, these methodologies can be problematic because of off-target drug effects and the possible nonphysiological consequences of lifelong genetic alterations. Therefore, alternative methods to study this important respiratory muscle are needed. To resolve this, we have developed a methodology to deliver recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors to the rat diaphragm via direct intramuscular injection. We hypothesized that by direct injection of rAAV into the muscle we can selectively target the diaphragm and establish a novel experimental method for studying signaling pathways and also provide a strategy for effectively using rAAV to protect the diaphragm against disease. This report describes the methods and evidence to support the use of rAAV as a therapeutic intervention to study rat diaphragm biology during conditions that promote diaphragm dysfunction.","176":"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are promising tools in gene therapy, but accurate quantification of the vector dose remains a critical issue for their successful application. We therefore aimed at the precise determination of the titer of self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors to improve the reliability of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown approaches. Vector titers were initially determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using four primer sets targeting different regions within the AAV vector genome (VG) and either coiled or linearized plasmid standards. Despite very low variability between replicates in each assay, these quantification experiments revealed up to 20-fold variation in vector titers. Therefore, we developed a novel approach for the reproducible determination of titers of scAAV vectors based on the use of purified genomic vector DNA as a standard (scAAVStd). Consistent results were obtained in qPCR assays using the four primer sets mentioned above. RNAi-mediated silencing of human cyclophilin B (hCycB) by short hairpin RNA-expressing scAAV vectors was investigated in HeLa cells using two independent vector preparations. We found that the required vector titers for efficient knockdown differed by a factor of 3.5 between both preparations. Hence, we also investigated the number of internalized scAAV vectors, termed transduction units (TUs). TUs were determined by qPCR applying the scAAVStd. Very similar values for 80% hCycB knockdown were obtained for the two AAV vector preparations. Thus, only the determination of TUs, rather than vector concentration, allows for reproducible results in functional analyses using AAV vectors.","177":"","178":null,"179":null,"180":null,"181":null,"182":null,"183":null,"184":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent nonhematopoietic cells with the ability to differentiate into various specific cell types, thus holding great promise for regenerative medicine. Early clinical trials have proven that MSC-based therapy is safe, with possible efficacy in various diseased states. Moreover, genetic modification of MSCs to improve their function can be safely achieved using electrogene transfer. We previously achieved transfection efficiencies of up to 32% with preserved viability in rat MSCs. In this study, we further improved the transfection efficiency and transgene expression in human MSCs (hMSCs), while preserving the cells viability and ability to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes by increasing the plasmid concentration and altering the osmotic pressure of the electrotransfer buffer. Using a square-wave electric pulse generator, we achieved a transfection efficiency of more than 80%, with around 70% viability and a detectable transgene expression of up to 30 days. Moreover, we demonstrated that this transfection efficiency can be reproduced reliably on two different sources of hMSCs: the bone marrow and adipose tissue. We also showed that there was no significant donor variability in terms of their transfection efficiency and viability. The cell confluency before electrotransfer had no significant effect on the transfection efficiency and viability. Cryopreservation of transfected cells maintained their transgene expression and viability upon thawing. In summary, we are reporting a robust, safe, and efficient protocol of electrotransfer for hMSCs with several practical suggestions for an optimal use of genetically engineered hMSCs for clinical application.","185":"The ability to regulate both the timing and specificity of gene expression mediated by viral vectors will be important in maximizing its utility. We describe the development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vector with tissue-specific gene regulation, using the ARGENT dimerizer-inducible system. This two-vector system based on AAV serotype 9 consists of one vector encoding a combination of reporter genes from which expression is directed by a ubiquitous, inducible promoter and a second vector encoding transcription factor domains under the control of either a heart- or liver-specific promoter, which are activated with a small molecule. Administration of the vectors via either systemic or intrapericardial injection demonstrated that the vector system is capable of mediating gene expression that is tissue specific, regulatable, and reproducible over induction cycles. Somatic gene transfer in vivo is being considered in therapeutic applications, although its most substantial value will be in basic applications such as target validation and development of animal models.","186":null,"187":null,"188":null,"189":"Several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system are potentially treatable via viral vector-mediated gene transfer. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have been used in clinical trials because of their desirable properties including a high degree of safety, efficacy, and stability. Major factors affecting tropism, expression level, and cell type specificity of AAV-mediated transgenes include encapsidation of different AAV serotypes, promoter selection, and the timing of vector administration. In this study, we evaluated the ability of single-stranded AAV2 vectors pseudotyped with viral capsids from serotype 9 (AAV2\/9) to transduce the brain and target gene expression to specific cell types after intracerebroventricular injection into mice. Titer-matched AAV2\/9 vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter, driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, or the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter, were injected bilaterally into the lateral ventricles of C57\/BL6 mice on postnatal day 5 (neonatal) or 21 (juvenile). Brain sections were analyzed 25 days after injection, using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. eGFP immunohistochemistry after neonatal and juvenile administration of viral vectors revealed transduction throughout the brain including the striatum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum, but with different patterns of cell-specific gene expression. eGFP expression was seen in astrocytes after treatment on postnatal day 5 with vectors carrying the CMV promoter, expanding the usefulness of AAVs for modeling and treating diseases involving glial cell pathology. In contrast, injection of AAV2\/9-CMV-eGFP on postnatal day 21 resulted in preferential transduction of neurons. Administration of AAV2\/9-eGFP with the synapsin-1 promoter on either postnatal day 5 or 21 resulted in widespread neuronal transduction. These results outline efficient methods and tools for gene delivery to the nervous system by direct, early postnatal administration of AAV vectors. Our findings highlight the importance of promoter selection and age of administration on the intensity, distribution, and cell type specificity of AAV transduction in the brain.","190":"Over the last two decades, several attempts to generate packaging cells for lentiviral vectors (LV) have been made. Despite different technologies, no packaging clone is currently employed in clinical trials. We developed a new strategy for LV stable production based on the HEK-293T progenitor cells; the sequential insertion of the viral genes by integrating vectors; the constitutive expression of the viral components; and the RD114-TR envelope pseudotyping. We generated the intermediate clone PK-7 expressing constitutively gag\/pol and rev genes and, by adding tat and rd114-tr genes, the stable packaging cell line RD2-MolPack, which can produce LV carrying any transfer vector (TV). Finally, we obtained the RD2-MolPack-Chim3 producer clone by transducing RD2-MolPack cells with the TV expressing the anti-HIV transgene Chim3. Remarkably, RD114-TR pseudovirions have much higher potency when produced by stable compared with transient technology. Most importantly, comparable transduction efficiency in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is obtained with 2-logs less physical particles respect to VSV-G pseudovirions produced by transient transfection. Altogether, RD2-MolPack technology should be considered a valid option for large-scale production of LV to be used in gene therapy protocols employing HSC, resulting in the possibility of downsizing the manufacturing scale by about 10-fold in respect to transient technology.","191":null,"192":null,"193":"It has been recently demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have increasing potential for gene therapy or regenerative cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, current therapies involving EPCs are inefficient because of the very low level of EPCs in the available sources, for example, in blood. One solution is to derive in vitro an expanded population of EPCs from circulation. In addition, EPCs like other progenitor cells have an intrinsic predisposition of differentiating into mature cell types, for example, mature endothelial cells; therefore, establishing a sufficient amount of EPCs alongside maintaining the EPC characteristic phenotype during genetic modification and long-term culture presents a significant challenge to the field of gene and cell therapies. In this study, we have systematically investigated EPCs from different sources and used multiple parameters, including cell surface markers and a tubule formation assay to identify factors that influence the establishment, characteristics, and vector transduction capability of EPCs. Our results show the considerable promise, as well as certain limitations in the establishment and manipulation of genetically modified EPCs for gene therapy. While obtaining high transduction efficiency and robust in vitro tubule formation of EPCs using lentiviral vectors, we also observed that lentiviral vector transduction significantly altered EPC phenotype as demonstrated by an increased percentage of CD34(+) progenitor cells and increased expression of adhesion molecule CD144 (VE-cadherin). Taking account of the increased expression of CD144 reported in cancer patients, the altered expression of EPC-related markers, for example, VE-cadherin and the enrichment of CD34(+) cells, after vector transduction indicates the importance of extensive characterization and vigorous safety control of genetically modified EPCs before they are accepted for clinical use.","194":"A major challenge in regenerative medicine is to develop methods for delivering growth and differentiation factors in specific spatial and temporal patterns, thereby mimicking the natural processes of development and tissue repair. Heat shock (HS)-inducible gene expression systems can respond to spatial information provided by localized heating, but are by themselves incapable of sustained expression. Conversely, gene switches activated by small molecules provide tight temporal control and sustained expression, but lack mechanisms for spatial targeting. Here we combine the advantages of HS and ligand-activated systems by developing a novel rapamycin-regulated, HS-inducible gene switch that provides spatial and temporal control and sustained expression of transgenes such as firefly luciferase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This gene circuit exhibits very low background in the uninduced state and can be repeatedly activated up to 1 month. Furthermore, dual regulation of VEGF induction in vivo is shown to stimulate localized vascularization, thereby providing a route for temporal and spatial control of angiogenesis.","195":"Targeting transgene expression to specific hematopoietic cell lineages could contribute to the safety of retroviral vectors in gene therapeutic applications. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a defect of phagocytic cells, can be managed by gene therapy, using retroviral vectors with targeted expression to myeloid cells. In this context, we analyzed the myelospecificity of the human miR223 promoter, which is known to be strongly upregulated during myeloid differentiation, to drive myeloid-restricted expression of p47(phox) and gp91(phox) in mouse models of CGD and in primary patient-derived cells. The miR223 promoter restricted the expression of p47(phox), gp91(phox), and green fluorescent protein (GFP) within self-inactivating (SIN) gamma- and lentiviral vectors to granulocytes and macrophages, with only marginal expression in lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Furthermore, gene transfer into primary CD34+ cells derived from a p47(phox) patient followed by ex vivo differentiation to neutrophils resulted in restoration of Escherichia coli killing activity by miR223 promoter-mediated p47(phox) expression. These results indicate that the miR223 promoter as an internal promoter within SIN gene therapy vectors is able to efficiently correct the CGD phenotype with negligible activity in hematopoietic progenitors, thereby limiting the risk of insertional oncogenesis and development of clonal dominance.","196":"As the possibility of tumorigenesis and undesirable immune responses in patients cannot be completely excluded in gene and cell therapies, a conditional death switch to eliminate the therapeutic cells would be a valuable tool to enhance the safety of these therapies. A few ligand-receptor conditional death switches have already been developed; however, they cannot be used if patients exhibit side effects upon administration of the ligand. Here we demonstrate a death-inducing chimeric antibody named \"death signalobody,\" in which the antigen-antibody system, having virtually infinite ligand-receptor combinations, is utilized for the activation of death signaling. We designed a death signalobody named \"SFas,\" which has an antifluorescein single-chain variable fragment and the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. SFas efficiently induced conditional apoptosis in murine pro-B Ba\/F3 cells in response to fluorescein-conjugated bovine serum albumin. Moreover, SFas was also able to induce antigen-dependent conditional apoptosis in human cancer cell lines. The death signalobody technique will be a valuable tool for the conditional elimination of cells of interest in multiple therapeutic applications.","197":null,"198":null,"199":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors are promising tools for gene therapeutic applications, in part because AAVs are nonpathogenic viruses, and vectors derived from them can drive long-term transgene expression without integration of the vector DNA into the host genome. AAVs are not strongly immunogenic, but they can, nonetheless, give rise to both a cellular and humoral immune response. As a result, a significant fraction of potential patients for AAV-based gene therapy harbors pre-existing antibodies against AAV. Because even very low levels of antibodies can prevent successful transduction, antecedent anti-AAV antibodies pose a serious obstacle to the universal application of AAV gene therapy. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the role of anti-AAV antibodies in AAV-based gene therapy with a particular emphasis on approaches to overcome the hurdle that they pose.","200":null,"201":"Gene therapy using a Tat-dependent expression system of MazF, an ACA nucleotide sequence-specific endoribonuclease derived from Escherichia coli, in a retroviral vector appears to be an alternative approach to the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. MazF can cleave HIV-1 RNA, since it has more than 240 ACA sequences. Significant inhibition of viral replication, irrespective of HIV-1 strains, was observed in CD4(+) T cells that had been transduced with the MazF-expressing retroviral vector (MazF-T cells). The growth and viability of MazF-T cells were not affected by HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, the infectivity of HIV-1 produced from MazF-T cells was found to be lower than that from control CD4(+) T cells. A long-term culture experiment with HIV-1-infected cells revealed that viral replication was always lower in MazF-T cells than in CD4(+) T cells transduced with or without a control vector for more than 200 days. MazF was expressed and mainly localized in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Unlike in CD4(+) T cells, the expression level of Tat gradually decreased rather than increased in MazF-T cells after HIV-1 infection. As a consequence, the expression level of MazF appeared to be well regulated and sustained during HIV-1 infection in MazF-T cells. Furthermore, the levels of cellular mRNA were not affected by HIV-1 infection. Thus, the Tat-dependent MazF expression system has great potential for inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo without apparent toxicity and may be able to avoid the emergence of resistant strains.","202":"Retroviral gene transfer has proven therapeutic potential in clinical gene therapy trials but may also cause abnormal cell growth via perturbation of gene expression in the locus surrounding the insertion site. By establishing clonal marks, retroviral insertions are also used to describe the regenerative potential of individual cells. Deep sequencing approaches have become the method of choice to study insertion profiles in preclinical models and clinical trials. We used a protocol combining ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) and pyrosequencing for insertion profiling and quantification in cells of various tissues transduced with various retroviral vectors. The presented method allows simultaneous analysis of a multitude of DNA-barcoded samples per pyrosequencing run, thereby allowing cost-effective insertion screening in studies with multiple samples. In addition, we investigated whether the number of pyrosequencing reads can be used to quantify clonal abundance. By comparing pyrosequencing reads against site-specific quantitative PCR and by performing spike-in experiments, we show that considerable variation exists in the quantification of insertion sites even when present in the same clone. Our results suggest that the protocol used here and similar approaches might misinterpret abundance clones defined by insertion sites, unless careful calibration measures are taken. The crucial variables causing this variation need to be defined and methodological improvements are required to establish pyrosequencing reads as a quantification measure in polyclonal situations.","203":null,"204":"Therapeutic angiogenesis by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene delivery is an attractive approach to treat ischemia. VEGF remains localized around each producing cell in vivo, and overexpression of mouse VEGF(164) (mVEGF(164)) induces normal or aberrant angiogenesis, depending strictly on its dose in the microenvironment in vivo. However, the dose-dependent effects of the clinically relevant factor, human VEGF(165) (hVEGF(165)), are unknown. Here we exploited a highly controlled gene delivery platform, based on clonal populations of transduced myoblasts overexpressing specific VEGF levels, to rigorously compare the in vivo dose-dependent effects of hVEGF(165) and mVEGF(164) in skeletal muscle of severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. While low levels of both factors efficiently induced similar amounts of normal angiogenesis, only high levels of mVEGF(164) caused widespread angioma-like structures, whereas equivalent or even higher levels of hVEGF(165) induced exclusively normal and mature capillaries. Expression levels were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). However, in vitro experiments showed that hVEGF(165) was significantly more effective in activating VEGF receptor signaling in human endothelial cells than mVEGF(164), while the opposite was true in murine endothelial cells. In conclusion, we found that, even though hVEGF is similarly efficient to the syngenic mVEGF in inducing angiogenesis at lower doses in a widely adopted and convenient mouse preclinical model, species-dependent differences in the relative activation of the respective receptors may specifically mask the toxic effects of high doses of the human factor.","205":"Generating gene and cell therapy products under good manufacturing practices is a complex process. When determining the cost of these products, researchers must consider the large number of supplies used for manufacturing and the personnel and facility costs to generate vector and maintain a cleanroom facility. To facilitate cost estimates, the Indiana University Vector Production Facility teamed with the Indiana University Kelley School of Business to develop a costing tool that, in turn, provides pricing. The tool is designed in Microsoft Excel and is customizable to meet the needs of other core facilities. It is available from the National Gene Vector Biorepository. The tool allows cost determinations using three different costing methods and was developed in an effort to meet the A21 circular requirements for U.S. core facilities performing work for federally funded projects. The costing tool analysis reveals that the cost of vector production does not have a linear relationship with batch size. For example, increasing the production from 9 to18 liters of a retroviral vector product increases total costs a modest 1.2-fold rather than doubling in total cost. The analysis discussed in this article will help core facilities and investigators plan a cost-effective strategy for gene and cell therapy production.","206":null,"207":"The ability to introduce transgenes with precise specificity to the desired target cells or tissues is key to a more facile application of genetic therapy. Here, we describe a novel method using nanotechnology to generate lentiviral vectors with altered recognition of host cell receptor specificity. Briefly, the infectivity of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was shielded by a thin polymer shell synthesized in situ onto the viral envelope, and new binding ability was conferred to the shielded virus by introducing acrylamide-tailored cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide to the polymer shell. We termed the resulting virus \"targeting nanovirus.\" The targeting nanovirus had similar titer with VSV-G pseudotypes and specifically transduced Hela cells with high transduction efficiency. In addition, the encapsulation of the VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus by the polymer shell did not change the pathway that VSV-G pseudotypes enter and fuse with cells, as well as later events such as reverse transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, the targeting nanovirus possessed enhanced stability in the presence of human serum, indicating protection of the virus by the polymer shell from human serum complement inactivation. This novel use of nanotechnology demonstrates proof of concept for an approach that could be more generally applied for redirecting viral vectors for laboratory and clinical purposes.","208":"In the treatment of genetic disorders, repairing defective pre-mRNAs by RNA trans-splicing has become an emerging alternative to conventional gene therapy. Previous studies have made clear that the design of the binding domains of the corrective RNA trans-splicing molecules (RTMs) is crucial for their optimal functionality. We established a reporter-based screening method that allows for selection of highly functional RTMs from a large pool of variants. The efficiency and functionality of the screen were validated in the COL7A1 gene, in which mutations are the cause of the skin disease dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Comparison of RTMs containing different binding domains hybridizing to COL7A1 intron 64\/exon 65 revealed highly different trans-splicing efficiencies. Isolated RTMs were then adapted for endogenous trans-splicing in a recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) keratinocyte cell line expressing reduced levels of COL7A1 mRNA. Our results confirm the applicability and relevance of prescreening reporter RTMs, as significant levels of endogenous COL7A1 mRNA repair were seen with RTMs identified as being highly efficient in our screening system.","209":null,"210":null,"211":"As HIV continues to be a global public health problem with no effective vaccine available, new and innovative therapies, including HIV gene therapies, need to be developed. Due to low transduction efficiencies that lead to low in vivo gene marking, therapeutically relevant efficacy of HIV gene therapy has been difficult to achieve in a clinical setting. Methods to improve the transplantation of enriched populations of anti-HIV vector-transduced cells may greatly increase the in vivo efficacy of HIV gene therapies. Here we describe the development of preselective anti-HIV lentiviral vectors that allow for the purification of vector-transduced cells to achieve an enriched population of HIV-resistant cells. A selectable protein, human CD25, not normally found on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), was incorporated into a triple combination anti-HIV lentiviral vector. Upon purification of cells transduced with the preselective anti-HIV vector, safety was demonstrated in CD34+ HPCs and in HPC-derived macrophages in vitro. Upon challenge with HIV-1, improved efficacy was observed in purified preselective anti-HIV vector-transduced macrophages compared to unpurified cells. These proof-of-concept results highlight the potential use of this method to improve HIV stem cell gene therapy for future clinical applications.","212":null,"213":"Use of adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is increasing; however, T-cell therapy can result in severe toxicity. Consequently, several suicide-gene strategies that allow selective destruction of the infused T cells have been described. We compared effectiveness of four such strategies in vitro in Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), human inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9), mutant human thymidylate kinase (mTMPK), and human CD20 codon optimized genes were cloned in frame with 2A-truncated codon optimized CD34 (dCD34) in a retroviral vector. Codon-optimization considerably improved CD20 expression. EBV-CTLs could be efficiently transduced in all constructs, with transgene expression similar to the control vector containing dCD34 alone. Expression was maintained for prolonged cultures. Expression of the suicide genes was not associated with alterations in immunophenotype, proliferation, or function of CTLs. Activation of HSV-TK, iCasp9, and CD20 ultimately resulted in equally effective destruction of transduced T cells. However, while iCasp9 and CD20 effected immediate cell-death induction, HSV-TK-expressing T cells required 3 days of exposure to ganciclovir to reach full effect. mTMPK-transduced cells showed lower T-cell killing all time points. Our results suggest that the faster activity of iCasp9 might be advantageous in treating certain types of acutely life-threatening toxicity. Codon-optimized CD20 has potential as a suicide gene.","214":null,"215":null,"216":"Vaccinia virus (VACV) has emerged as an attractive tool in oncolytic virotherapy. VACV replication efficiency plays a crucial role in the therapeutic outcome. However, little is known about the influence of host factors on viral replication efficiency and permissiveness of a host cell line to infection and oncolysis. In this study, replication of the attenuated VACV GLV-1h68 strain and three wild-type VACV isolates was determined in two autologous human melanoma cell lines (888-MEL and 1936-MEL). Host gene expression and viral gene expression in infected cells were evaluated via respective expression array platforms. Microarray analyses followed by sequential statistical approaches characterized human genes that change specifically due to virus infection. Viral gene transcription correlated with viral replication in a time-dependent manner. A set of human genes revealed strong correlations with the respective viral gene expression. Finally we identified a set of human genes with possible predictive value for viral replication in an independent dataset. The results demonstrate a probable correlation between viral replication, early gene expression, and the respective host response, and thus a possible involvement of human host factors in viral early replication. The characterization of human target genes that influence viral replication could help answer the question of host cell permissiveness to oncolytic virotherapy and provide important information for the development of novel recombinant vaccinia viruses with improved features to enhance replication rate and hence trigger therapeutic outcome.","217":"The release of lentiviral vectors for clinical use requires the testing of vector material, production cells, and, if applicable, ex vivo-transduced cells for the presence of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL). Vectors derived from the nonprimate lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) have been directly administered to patients in several clinical trials, with no toxicity observed to date. Because EIAV does not replicate in human cells, and because putative RCLs derived from vector components within human vector production cells would most likely be human cell-tropic, we previously developed an RCL assay using amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a surrogate positive control and human cells as RCL amplification\/indicator cells. Here we report an additional RCL assay that tests for the presence of theoretical \"equine-tropic\" RCLs. This approach provides further assurance of safety by detecting putative RCLs with an equine cell-specific tropism that might not be efficiently amplified by the human cell-based RCL assay. We tested the ability of accessory gene-deficient EIAV mutant viruses to replicate in a highly permissive equine cell line to direct our choice of a suitable EIAV-derived positive control. In addition, we report for the first time the mathematical rationale for use of the Poisson distribution to calculate minimal infectious dose of positive control virus and for use in monitoring assay positive\/spike control failures in accumulating data sets. No RCLs have been detected in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant RCL assays to date, further demonstrating that RCL formation is highly unlikely in contemporary minimal lentiviral vector systems.","218":null,"219":"Restoration of the open reading frame of the DMD gene and dystrophin protein production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be achieved by exon skipping using antisense oligomers (AOs) targeted to splicing elements. Several such RNA-based gene therapy approaches are in clinical development in which all studies to date have assessed AO efficacy by semiquantitative nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Precise evaluation of dystrophin protein levels is complex and hindered by the large size and low abundance of dystrophin; thus an accurate and standardized measurement of DMD exon skipping at the RNA level remains important to assess and compare patient responses in DMD exon skipping clinical trials. Here we describe the development of a Taqman quantitative (q)RT-PCR assay to quantify exon skipping and highlight its use to determine the levels of exon skipping in DMD patients treated intramuscularly with a morpholino AO to skip exon 51, eteplirsen (AVI-4658). The muscle biopsies of these patients were previously thoroughly characterized, providing a valuable benchmark for the evaluation of novel methodology. We demonstrate that levels of dystrophin protein restoration, and thus patient response, correlate accurately with the RNA level. Furthermore, this sensitive assay detects revertant exon 51 skipped fibers in untreated biopsies, providing an important baseline to precisely quantify treatment success. This study represents the first quantitative assessment of exon skipping in a clinical trial setting. We present a standardized and reproducible method to assess patient response that will complement protein studies in future preclinical and clinical exon skipping-based gene therapy studies for DMD.","220":null,"221":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can induce normal angiogenesis or the growth of angioma-like vascular tumors depending on the amount secreted by each producing cell because it remains localized in the microenvironment. In order to control the distribution of VEGF expression levels in vivo, we recently developed a high-throughput fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based technique to rapidly purify transduced progenitors that homogeneously express a specific VEGF dose from a heterogeneous primary population. Here we tested the hypothesis that cell-based delivery of a controlled VEGF level could induce normal angiogenesis in the heart, while preventing the development of angiomas. Freshly isolated human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASC) were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing either rat VEGF linked to a FACS-quantifiable cell-surface marker (a truncated form of CD8) or CD8 alone as control (CTR). VEGF-expressing cells were FACS-purified to generate populations producing either a specific VEGF level (SPEC) or uncontrolled heterogeneous levels (ALL). Fifteen nude rats underwent intramyocardial injection of 10(7) cells. Histology was performed after 4 weeks. Both the SPEC and ALL cells produced a similar total amount of VEGF, and both cell types induced a 50%-60% increase in both total and perfused vessel density compared to CTR cells, despite very limited stable engraftment. However, homogeneous VEGF expression by SPEC cells induced only normal and stable angiogenesis. Conversely, heterogeneous expression of a similar total amount by the ALL cells caused the growth of numerous angioma-like structures. These results suggest that controlled VEGF delivery by FACS-purified ASC may be a promising strategy to achieve safe therapeutic angiogenesis in the heart.","222":null,"223":"We previously reported that self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) type 2 genomes of up to 3.3 kb can be successfully encapsidated into AAV2 serotype capsids. Here we report that such oversized AAV2 genomes fail to undergo packaging in other AAV serotype capsids, such as AAV1, AAV3, AAV6, and AAV8, as determined by Southern blot analyses of the vector genomes, although hybridization signals on quantitative DNA slot-blots could still be obtained. Recently, it has been reported that quantitative real-time PCR assays may result in substantial differences in determining titers of scAAV vectors depending on the distance between the primer sets and the terminal hairpin structure in the scAAV genomes. We also observed that the vector titers determined by the standard DNA slot-blot assays were highly dependent on the specific probe being used, with probes hybridizing to the ends of viral genomes being significantly overrepresented compared with the probes hybridizing close to the middle of the viral genomes. These differences among various probes were not observed using Southern blot assays. This overestimation of titer is a systemic error during scAAV genome quantification, regardless of viral genome sequences and capsid serotypes. Furthermore, different serotypes capsid and modification of capsid sequence may affect the ability of packaging intact, full-length AAV genomes. Although the discrepancy is modest with wild-type serotype capsid and short viral genomes, the measured titer could be as much as fivefold different with capsid mutant vectors and large genomes. Thus, based on our data, we suggest that Southern blot analyses should be performed routinely to more accurately determine the titers of recombinant AAV vectors. At the very least, the use of probes\/primers hybridizing close to the mutant inverted terminal repeat in scAAV genomes is recommended to avoid possible overestimation of vector titers.","224":null,"225":"Tissue-targeted expression is of major interest for studying the contribution of cellular subpopulations to neurodegenerative diseases. However, in vivo methods to investigate this issue are limited. Here, we report an analysis of the cell specificity of expression of fluorescent reporter genes driven by six neuronal promoters, with the ubiquitous phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter used as a reference. Quantitative analysis of AcGFPnuc expression in the striatum and hippocampus of rodents showed that all lentiviral vectors (LV) exhibited a neuronal tropism; however, there was substantial diversity of transcriptional activity and cell-type specificity of expression. The promoters with the highest activity were those of the 67 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), homeobox Dlx5\/6, glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), and preprotachykinin 1 (Tac1) genes. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and dopaminergic receptor 1 (Drd1a) promoters showed weak activity, but the integration of an amplification system into the LV overcame this limitation. In the striatum, the expression profiles of Tac1 and Drd1a were not limited to the striatonigral pathway, whereas in the hippocampus, Drd1a and Dlx5\/6 showed the expected restricted pattern of expression. Regulation of the Dlx5\/6 promoter was observed in a disease condition, whereas Tac1 activity was unaffected. These vectors provide safe tools that are more selective than others available, for the administration of therapeutic molecules in the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, additional characterization of regulatory elements in neuronal promoters is still required.","226":null,"227":null,"228":null,"229":null,"230":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors have gained increasing attention as gene delivery vehicles in basic and preclinical studies as well as in human gene therapy trials. Especially for the latter two-for both safety and therapeutic efficacy reasons-a detailed characterization of all relevant parameters of the vector preparation is essential. Two important parameters that are routinely used to analyze recombinant AAV vectors are (1) the titer of viral particles containing a (recombinant) viral genome and (2) the purity of the vector preparation, most commonly assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by silver staining. An important, third parameter, the titer of total viral particles, that is, the combined titer of both genome-containing and empty viral capsids, is rarely determined. Here, we describe a simple and inexpensive method that allows the simultaneous assessment of both vector purity and the determination of the total viral particle titer. This method, which was validated by comparison with established methods to determine viral particle titers, is based on the fact that Coomassie Brilliant Blue, when bound to proteins, fluoresces in the infrared spectrum. Viral samples are separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and gel analysis with an infrared laser-scanning device. In combination with a protein standard, our method allows the rapid and accurate determination of viral particle titers simultaneously with the assessment of vector purity.","231":null,"232":"Canine adenovirus vectors (CAV2) are currently being evaluated for gene therapy, oncolytic virotherapy, and as vectors for recombinant vaccines. Despite the need for increasing volumes of purified CAV2 preparations for preclinical and clinical testing, their purification still relies on the use of conventional, scale-limited CsCl ultracentrifugation techniques. A complete downstream processing strategy for CAV2 vectors based on membrane filtration and chromatography is reported here. Microfiltration and ultra\/diafiltration are selected for clarification and concentration of crude viral stocks containing both intracellular and extracellular CAV2 particles. A DNase digestion step is introduced between ultrafiltration and diafiltration operations. At these early stages, concentration of vector stocks with good recovery of viral particles (above 80%) and removal of a substantial amount of protein and nucleic acid contaminants is achieved. The ability of various chromatography techniques to isolate CAV2 particles was evaluated. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a Fractogel propyl tentacle resin was selected as a first chromatography step, because it allows removal of the bulk of contaminating proteins with high CAV2 yields (88%). An anion-exchange chromatography step using monolithic supports is further introduced to remove the remaining contaminants with good recovery of CAV2 particles (58-69%). The main CAV2 viral structural components are visualized in purified preparations by electrophoresis analyses. Purified vector stocks contained intact icosahedral viral particles, low contamination with empty viral capsids (10%), and an acceptable total-to-infectious particle ratio (below 30). The downstream processing strategy that was developed allows preparation of large volumes of high-quality CAV2 stocks.","233":"In vivo electroporation (EP) is an efficient nonviral method for enhancing DNA vaccine delivery and immunogenicity in animals and humans. Intradermal delivery of DNA vaccines is an attractive strategy because of the immunocompetence of skin tissue. We have previously reported a minimally invasive surface intradermal EP (SEP) device for delivery of prophylactic DNA vaccines. Robust antibody responses were induced after vaccine delivery via surface EP in several tested animal models. Here we further investigated the optimal EP parameters for efficient delivery of DNA vaccines, with a specific emphasis on eliciting cellular immunity in addition to robust humoral responses. In a mouse model, using applied voltages of 10-100 V, transgene expression of green fluorescent protein and luciferase reporter genes increased significantly when voltages as low as 10 V were used as compared with DNA injection only. Tissue damage to skin was undetectable when voltages of 20 V and less were applied. However, inflammation and bruising became apparent at voltages above 40 V. Delivery of DNA vaccines encoding influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin (H5HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza H1N1 at applied voltages of 10-100 V elicited robust and sustained antibody responses. In addition, low-voltage (less than 20 V) EP elicited higher and more sustained cellular immune responses when compared with the higher voltage (above 20 V) EP groups after two immunizations. The data confirm that low-voltage EP, using the SEP device, is capable of efficient delivery of DNA vaccines into the skin, and establishes that these parameters are sufficient to elicit both robust and sustainable humoral as well as cellular immune responses without tissue damage. The SEP device, functioning within these parameters, may have important clinical applications for delivery of prophylactic DNA vaccines against diseases such as HIV infection, malaria, and tuberculosis that require both cellular and humoral immune responses for protection.","234":null,"235":null,"236":"Inverted terminal repeat (ITR) integrity is critical for the replication, packaging, and transduction of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), a promising gene therapy vector. Because AAV ITRs possess 70% GC content and are palindromic, they are notoriously difficult to sequence. The purpose of this work was to develop a reliable ITR sequencing method. The ITRs of two molecular clones of AAV2, pTZAAV and pAV2, were (1) sequenced directly from plasmid DNA in the presence of denaturant (direct sequencing method, DSM) or (2) first amplified in a reaction in which 7-deaza-dGTP was substituted for dGTP and the resultant amplification product sequenced (amplification sequencing method, ASM). The DSM and ASM techniques yielded clear chromatograms, read through the ITR hairpin, and revealed hitherto unreported mutations in each ITR. pTZAAV and pAV2 possess identical mutations at the upstream MscI site of the 5' ITR (T&gt;G, nt 2) and the downstream MscI site of the 3' ITR (del. nt 4672-4679). The chromatograms for pAV2 also revealed that the ITRs of this construct were arranged in a FLOP\/FLOP orientation. In addition, the DSM was successfully employed to recover ITR-chromosomal junction sequences from a variety of rAAV-transduced tissue types. Both the DSM and ASM can be employed to sequence through the AAV ITR hairpin, and both techniques reliably detect mutations in the ITR. Because the DSM and ASM offer a way to verify ITR integrity, they constitute powerful tools for the process development of rAAV gene therapy.","237":"Gene therapy for neurological diseases requires efficient gene delivery to target tissues in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although adeno-associated virus is one of the most promising vectors for clinical use against neurological diseases, it is difficult to get it across the blood-brain barrier. A clinically practical approach to using a vector based on adeno-associated virus to decrease the expression of a specific gene in both the central and the peripheral nervous system has yet to be established. Here, we analyzed whether upper lumbar intrathecal administration of a therapeutic vector incorporating adeno-associated virus and short-hairpin RNA against superoxide dismutase-1 bypassed the blood-brain barrier to target the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. The therapeutic vector effectively suppressed mRNA and protein expression of endogenous superoxide dismutase-1 in the lumbar spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Moreover, neither neurological side effects nor toxicity due to the incorporated short-hairpin RNA occurred after the injection. We propose that this approach could be developed into novel therapies for motor neuron diseases and chronic pain conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome, through silencing of the genes responsible for pathologies in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia.","238":"Use of perfluorochemical liquids during intratracheal vector administration enhances recombinant adenovirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated lung epithelial gene expression. We hypothesized that inhalation of nebulized perfluorochemical vapor would also enhance epithelial gene expression after subsequent intratracheal vector administration. Freely breathing adult C57BL\/6 mice were exposed for selected times to nebulized perflubron or sterile saline in a sealed Plexiglas chamber. Recombinant adenoviral vector was administered by transtracheal puncture at selected times afterward and mice were killed 3 days after vector administration to assess transgene expression. Mice tolerated the nebulized perflubron without obvious ill effects. Vector administration 6 hr after nebulized perflubron exposure resulted in an average 540% increase in gene expression in airway and alveolar epithelium, compared with that with vector alone or saline plus vector control (p&lt;0.05). However, vector administration 1 hr, 1 day, or 3 days after perflubron exposure was not different from either nebulized saline with vector or vector alone and a 60-min exposure to nebulized perflubron is required. In parallel pilot studies in macaques, inhalation of nebulized perflubron enhanced recombinant AAV2\/5 vector expression throughout the lung. Serial chest radiographs, bronchoalveolar lavages, and results of complete blood counts and serum biochemistries demonstrated no obvious adverse effects of nebulized perflubron. Further, one macaque receiving nebulized perflubron only was monitored for 1 year with no obvious adverse effects of exposure. These results demonstrate that inhalation of nebulized perflubron, a simple, clinically more feasible technique than intratracheal administration of liquid perflubron, safely enhances lung gene expression.","239":"Clonality analysis of viral vector-transduced cell populations represents a convincing approach to dissect the physiology of tissue and organ regeneration, to monitor the fate of individual gene-corrected cells in vivo, and to assess vector biosafety. With the decoding of mammalian genomes and the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies, the demand for automated bioinformatic analysis tools that can rapidly process and annotate vector integration sites is rising. Here, we provide a publicly accessible, graphical user interface-guided automated bioinformatic high-throughput integration site analysis pipeline. Its performance and key features are illustrated on pyrosequenced linear amplification-mediated PCR products derived from one patient previously enrolled in the first lentiviral vector clinical gene therapy study. Analysis includes trimming of vector genome junctions, alignment of genomic sequence fragments to the host genome for the identification of integration sites, and the annotation of nearby genomic elements. Most importantly, clinically relevant features comprise the determination of identical integration sites with respect to different time points or cell lineages, as well as the retrieval of the most prominent cell clones and common integration sites. The resulting output is summarized in tables within a convenient spreadsheet and can be further processed by researchers without profound bioinformatic knowledge.","240":"Human ex vivo gene therapy protocols have been used successfully to treat a variety of genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer. Murine oncoretroviruses (specifically, gammaretroviruses) have served as the primary gene delivery vehicles for these trials. However, in some cases, such vectors have been associated with insertional mutagenesis. As a result, alternative vector platforms such as lentiviral vectors (LVVs) are being developed. LVVs may provide advantages compared with gammaretroviral vectors, including the ability to transduce large numbers of nondividing cells, resistance to gene silencing, and a potentially safer integration profile. The aim of this study was to develop a simplified process for the rapid production of clinical-grade LVVs. To that end, we used a self-inactivating bicistronic LVV encoding an MART (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells)-1-reactive T cell receptor containing oPRE, an optimized and truncated version of woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranslational regulatory element (wPRE). Using our simplified clinical production process, 293T cells were transiently transfected in roller bottles. The LVV supernatant was collected, treated with Benzonase, and clarified by modified step filtration. LVV produced in this manner exhibited titers and a biosafety profile similar to those of cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) LVVs previously manufactured at the Indiana University Vector Production Facility in support of a phase I\/II clinical trial. We describe a simple, efficient, and low-cost method for the production of clinical-grade LVV for ex vivo gene therapy protocols.","241":"Gene transfer for research or gene therapy requires the design of vectors that allow for adequate and safe transgene expression. Current methods to modulate the safety and expression profile of retroviral vectors can involve the insertion of insulators or scaffold\/matrix-attachment regions in self-inactivating long terminal repeats (SIN-LTRs). Here, we generated a set of lentiviral vectors (with internal CMV or PGK promoter) in which we inserted (at the level of SIN-LTRs) sequences of avian (i.e., chicken hypersensitive site-4, cHS4), human (i.e., putative insulator and desert sequence), or bacterial origin. We characterized them with respect to viral titer, integration, transduction efficiency and transgene expression levels, in both integrase-proficient and -deficient contexts. We found that the cHS4 insulator enhanced transgene expression by a factor of 1.5 only when cloned in the antisense orientation. On the other hand, cHS4 in the sense orientation as well as all other inserts decreased transgene expression. This attenuation phenomenon persisted over long periods of time and did not correspond to extinction or variegation. Decreased transgene expression was associated with lower mRNA levels, yet RNA stability was not affected. Insertions within the SIN-LTRs may negatively affect transgene transcription in a direct fashion through topological rearrangements. The lentiviral vectors that we generated constitute valuable genetic tools for manipulating the level of transgene expression. Moreover, this study demonstrates that SIN-LTR inserts can decrease transgene expression, a phenomenon that might be overcome by modifying insert orientation, thereby highlighting the importance of careful vector design for gene therapy.","242":null,"243":"Advances in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy have brought the possibility of commercial manufacturing of AAV vectors one step closer. To realize this prospect, a parallel effort with the goal of ever-increasing sophistication for AAV vector production technology and supporting assays will be required. Among the important release assays for a clinical gene therapy product, those monitoring potentially hazardous contaminants are most critical for patient safety. A prominent contaminant in many AAV vector preparations is vector particles lacking a genome, which can substantially increase the dose of AAV capsid proteins and lead to possible unwanted immunological consequences. Current methods to determine empty particle content suffer from inconsistency, are adversely affected by contaminants, or are not applicable to all serotypes. Here we describe the development of an ion-exchange chromatography-based assay that permits the rapid separation and relative quantification of AAV8 empty and full vector particles through the application of shallow gradients and a strong anion-exchange monolith chromatography medium.","244":null,"245":null,"246":"Viral vectors based on various naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes are among the most promising tools in human gene therapy. For the production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors, researchers are focusing predominantly on cross-packaging an artificial AAV genome based on serotype 2 (AAV2) into capsids derived from other serotypes. Within the packaged genome the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) are the only cis-acting viral elements required for rAAV vector generation and depict the lowest common denominator of all AAV2-derived vector genomes. Up to now, no quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the detection and quantification of AAV2 ITRs could be established because of their extensive secondary hairpin structure formation. Current qPCR-based methods are therefore targeting vector-encoded transgenes or regulatory elements. Herein we establish a molecular biological method that allows accurate and reproducible quantification of AAV2 genomes on the basis of an AAV2 ITR sequence-specific qPCR. Primers and labeled probe are located within the ITR sequence and have been designed to detect both wild-type AAV2 and AAV2-based vectors. This method is suitable for detecting single-stranded DNA derived from AAV2 vector particles and double-stranded DNA derived from vector plasmids. The limit of detection has been determined as 50 ITR sequence copies per reaction, by comparison with a plasmid standard. In conclusion, this method describes the first qPCR system facilitating the detection and quantification of AAV2 ITR sequences. Because this method can be used universally for all AAV2 genome-based vectors, it will significantly simplify rAAV2 vector titrations in the future.","247":"Lentiviral vectors are promising tools for liver disease gene therapy, because they can achieve protracted expression of transgenes in hepatocytes. However, the question as to whether cell division is required for optimal hepatocyte transduction has still not been completely answered. Liver gene-transfer efficiency after in vivo administration of recombinant lentiviral vectors carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter gene under the control of a liver-specific promoter in mice that were either hepatectomized or treated with cholic acid or phenobarbital was compared. Phenobarbital is known as a weak inducer of hepatocyte proliferation, whereas cholic acid has no direct effect on the cell cycle. This study shows that cholic acid is able to prime hepatocytes without mitosis induction. Both phenobarbital and cholic acid significantly increased hepatocyte transduction six- to ninefold, although cholic acid did not modify the mitotic index or cell-cycle entry. However, the effect of either compound was weaker than that observed after partial hepatectomy. In no cases was there a correlation between the expression of cell-cycle marker and transduction efficiency. We conclude that priming of hepatocytes should be considered a clinically applicable strategy to enhance in vivo liver gene therapy with lentiviral vectors.","248":"Self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vector genomes contain a covalently closed hairpin derived from a mutated inverted terminal repeat that connects the two monomer single-stranded genomes into a head-to-head or tail-to-tail dimer. We found that during quantitative PCR (qPCR) this structure inhibits the amplification of proximal amplicons and causes the systemic underreporting of copy number by as much as 10-fold. We show that cleavage of scAAV vector genomes with restriction endonuclease to liberate amplicons from the covalently closed terminal hairpin restores quantitative amplification, and we implement this procedure in a simple, modified qPCR titration method for scAAV vectors. In addition, we developed and present an AAV genome titration procedure based on gel electrophoresis that requires minimal sample processing and has low interassay variability, and as such is well suited for the rigorous quality control demands of clinical vector production facilities."},"articletitle":{"0":"LINC00958 Accelerates Cell Proliferation and Migration in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
