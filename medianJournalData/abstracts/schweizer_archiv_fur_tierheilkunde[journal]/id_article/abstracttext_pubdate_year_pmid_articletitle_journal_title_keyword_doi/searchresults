It carries a grave prognosis unless diagnosed early and adequate treatment is initiated within 8 hours of ingestion. Toxicity of ethylene glycol is related to the production of toxic metabolites by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), leading to early signs of severe polyuria (PU) and polydipsia (PD), gastritis, ataxia and central nervous depression, followed by progressive dehydration, and ultimately oligoanuric renal failure. In addition to general supportive care, therapeutic interventions must include either antidotes blocking ADH-mediated metabolism or blood purification techniques to remove both the parent compound and the toxic metabolites. The goal of this case report is to describe three cases of acute antifreeze intoxication in dogs, and to discuss treatment options available for this poisoning.","303":"During the years 2012 to 2014, a total of 5 affected Simmental cattle showing persistent bleeding after minor or unknown trauma, were presented at the Clinic for Ruminants or at the Institute for Genetics of the Vetsuisse-Faculty, University of Berne. The homozygous mutation RASGRP2, initially reported in 2007, was present in all these cases and all available parents were heterozygous carriers thus confirming the recessive mode of inheritance. Three affected animals died as a result of persistent bleeding. One animal was stabilized at the Clinic for Ruminants and was slaughtered one month later. Another case showing persistent bleeding and several hematomas was euthanized after genotyping. A frequency of 10% carriers for the associated mutation was detected in a sample of 145 Simmental sires which were used 2013 for artificial insemination in Switzerland.

Full-thickness biopsies from the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum were collected for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Microscopic lesions displayed severe diffuse degeneration and loss of leiomyocytes, with lymphocytic leiomyositis, fibroplasia, angiogenesis, severe diffuse neuronal atrophy, and ganglioneuritis in the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus. A diagnosis of chronic idiopatic intestinal pseudo-obstruction was made. Response to immunosuppressive therapy was poor and the dog was humanely euthanized. Unique findings were mononuclear infiltration composed predominantly of B-cell, angiogenesis and weak immunoreactivity for neuron-specific enolase.","325":"A 3-year-old cat was presented with anorexia and vomiting. Palpation revealed a caudal abdominal mass. Ultrasound and explorative abdominal surgery revealed a cystic mass in the jejunum. Histopathologic findings were consistent with an epidermoid cyst. The cyst was likely of congenital origin, since the cat had not undergone previous abdominal surgery, and gradually grew to reach a size that caused intestinal obstruction. Extrapolating from findings in people, intestinal epidermoid cysts are considered benign with a good long-term prognosis when completely excised.","326":"This retrospective study investigated possible risk factors for intermittent upward fixation of the patella and the outcome of medial patellar desmotomy in 12 cows. All but one young cow had distinctive clinical signs, which usually started in the periparturient period. Medial patellar desmotomy led to normalisation of the stride in 10 cows but did not improve the condition of the young cow. Another cow developed instability and signs of lateral patellar luxation in the affected stifle and was euthanized. The 10 cows that were operated successfully remained in the long term free of symptoms. Medial patellar desmotomy is a suitable treatment for upward patellar fixation in cattle but should be reserved for cows with typical clinical signs. The medial patellar ligament should be cut 4 to 6 cm proximal to its insertion on the tibia to minimise the risk of injury to the middle patellar ligament.","327":"","328":"","329":"","330":"","331":"Mastitis-Metritis-Agalactia (MMA), also known as postpartum dysgalactia syndrome (PPDS) is the most important disease complex in sows after birth. The present study compared 30 MMA problem herds (over 12% of farrowing sows affected) with 30 control farms (less than 10% of farrowing sows affected) to identify risk factors and treatment incidence. Important risk factors identified were in gilts the integration into the herd after the first farrowing, in gestating sows firm fecal consistency as well as in lactating sows soiled troughs, a low flow rate (&lt;2 liters per minute) in drinking nipples and a high prevalence of lameness. The treatment incidence was also significantly different between the two groups. The MMA prevalence could be reduced through optimization of husbandry, feeding and management, which could essentially diminish the use of antibiotics.","332":"In the present study, risk factors for the use of oral antibiotics in weaned piglets were collected on 112 pig farms by a personal questionaire. The most common indication for an antibiotic group therapy was diarrhoea, and the most frequently used antibiotic was Colistin. On average, 27.33 daily doses in the control farms and 387.21 daily doses in the problem farms per 1000 weaners were administered on a given day. The significant risk factors in the multivariate model were poor hygiene in the water supply of suckling piglets, less than two doses ofprestarter feed daily, lack of an all-in-and-all-out production system in weaners, no herd book performance data analysis, and less than two of the legally prescribed veterinary visits per year. Furthermore, the treatment incidence of weaners for oral antibiotics was calculated on the basis of the drug inventory. This study provides evidence that the use of oral antibiotics in weaners can be reduced by interventions in hygiene and management.","333":"The attitude as well as the expertise of a person affect the behavior and actions in daily life. To investigate the influence of attitude and knowledge of pig producers on the use of antibiotics in farms, 220 Swiss pig producers were questioned on health awareness, attitude towards sustainable production, risk behavior, intrinsic motivation and knowledge about antibiotics and resistance development. In addition, the strategy of antibiotic use (therapeutic or prophylactic) and the business practice (single or group therapy) for the amount of antibiotics on one hand and for the risk of antibiotic resistance development on the other hand, were determined in a personal interview. Farmers using antibiotics only therapeutically had a better business practice. A direct link between the personal attitude and the antibiotic use or a higher risk of development of antibiotic resistance was not found in this investigation.","334":"In a representative cross-sectional study during 12 months of the years 2008\/2009 in four abattoirs in Switzerland, lung and pleura lesions as well as lesions of slaughter carcasses and organs of 34 706 pigs were studied for frequency and type of macroscopic lesions. Of the 24276 examined pigs, 91.2% of the lungs, 94.4% of the heart and 95.5% of the livers showed no macroscopically visible lesions. Pigs that were produced for a label program had significantly less bronchopneumonia and pneumonia residuals, pleuritis and liver lesions due to echinococcosis. Pigs supervised by the Swiss Pig Health Service (SGD), showed significantly less bronchopneumonia and pneumonia residuals, diffuse pleuritis, pleuritis\/pericarditis and milkspots compared to the non-SGD supervised farms. Thanks to the national eradication program for enzootic pneumonia (EP) and actinobacillosis, the health-status of lungs has been considerably improved and the prevalence of pleurisy decreased considerably. The results of this study indicate a good herd health in Swiss pig production.","335":"","336":"","337":"","338":"","339":"A 1 year and 8 months old castrated male Pyrenean mountain dog was presented with an Achilles tendon rupture at least 5 weeks old.

The manual removal of the fetal membranes is practiced by 129 of the responding veterinarians. Cows with\/without fever are treated usually with intrauterine antibiotics. Cows with RFM with\/without fever are most commonly treated parenterally with tetracycline or penicillin. The use of cephalosporins and quinolones in cows with fever is more common than in cows without fever.

Both cows had ultrasonographic evidence of peritonitis with thickening of the intestinal wall and fibrin and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity. A diagnosis of peritonitis was made in both cows, most likely caused by rectal perforation; they were euthanized and a post-mortem examination was carried out. Both cows had proctitis and ulcerative colitis with three or four perforated ulcers which were associated with fibrinopurulent peritonitis. The final diagnosis was ulcerative colitis and proctitis of unknown aetiology. Infectious causes of colitis and proctitis, including bovine viral diarrhoea, adenovirus infection and salmonellosis, and trauma and poisoning were ruled out.","350":"Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease in horses caused by influenza A viruses. In this work a real-time RT-PCR for fast and sensitive diagnosis of equine influenza viruses (EIV) targeting a highly conserved region of the matrix gene was developed. In addition two RT-PCR methods for the amplification of large parts of the matrix- and HA gene were adapted for molecular-epidemiological characterization of viruses. The primers of the real-time RT-PCR had homologies of 99.4% to EIV- and 97.7% to all influenza A viral sequences, whereas the minor groove binder (MGB) probe showed homologies of 99.3% and 99.6%, respectively. These high values allow application of the assay for influenza viruses in other species. Using 20 equine, 11 porcine and 2 avian samples, diagnostic suitability of the assay was confirmed. High specificity for influenza viruses was shown both experimentally and by software simulation. The assay analytical sensitivity was at 10(2)-10(3) copies of RNA and 10(0)-10(1) copies of DNA, respectively. This allows virus detection also in circumstances of minor viral shedding. All amplified EIV sequences were classified phylogenetically within the known lineages.","351":"","352":"","353":"","354":"","355":"","356":null,"357":null,"358":null,"359":"","360":"","361":"","362":"This study presents a case of nasal aspergillosis in a 17-days old calf (German Fleckvieh): it had been admitted moribund to the Clinic for Ruminants of the University of Munich, and died after a short time.

Findings upon rectal examination, fecal output und defecation were normal. Ultrasound examination of the mass revealed features typical for an intussusception. Based on the slow development of symptoms, normal fecal output and ultrasonography findings, a ceco-cecal intussusception was diagnosed.

The objective of this study was to investigate if the coat colour and white markings have an impact on selected skin diseases and hoof horn abnormalities. To this purpose 974 three-year-old FM were subjected to a clinical examination during the field and station tests organized by the FM breeding association. In 16.9% of the horses, one or several equine sarcoids were detected, 15.2% of the horses showed clinical signs of pastern dermatitis, 1.1% of insect bite hypersensitivity and 18.0% of dermatitis of other aetiology. Abnormalities of the hoof horn were found in 20.1% of the horses. The prevalence of pastern dermatitis was 2.6 times higher in legs with white markings than in legs with pigmented skin (p &lt;0.0001). The probability ofsuffering from sunburn and hoof horn of lesser quality was increased in animals with an elevated white marking index (WAI; p = 0.022 and p = 0.038), on the other hand, horses with sarcoids had a significantly lower WAI than sound horses (p = 0.038). Our study shows that FM horses with more pronounced white markings have an increased risk to suffer from pastern dermatitis, sunburns and hoof horn abnormalities. The coat colour was not associated with skin diseases.","365":"","366":"","367":"","368":"","369":"","370":"","371":"","372":"","373":"This case report describes the clinical, ultrasonographic, pathological and histological findings in a two-year-old Swiss Braunvieh cow with granulosa cell tumor and metastases in the abdomen and thorax. The cow was ill and had tachycardia, coughing, increased breath sounds, positive reticular foreign body tests and a tense abdominal wall. Ultrasonography revealed a massive accumulation of hypoechoic fluid in the thorax and abdomen, and abdomino- and thoracocentesis yielded red fluid indicative of abdominal and thoracic haemorrhage. Because of a poor prognosis, the cow was euthanized and examined postmortem. Multiple nodular lesions were seen in the omentum, liver, spleen and lungs. The left ovary was grossly enlarged and nodular in appearance. Histological examination of the lesions revealed granulosa cell tumour of the left ovary and metastases in the omentum, liver, spleen and lungs.","374":"Eringer cows are often slaughtered due to fertility problems which result from inflammatory and degenerative changes of the uterus or hormonal imbalances. Twenty-one genital tracts from Eringer cows suffering from fertility problems were collected in the abattoir. The purpose of the study was the macroscopic evaluation of the ovaries and the uterus followed by a histological and microbiological analysis of the uterus. Data from inseminations and calvings were provided by the Eringer breeding association and through the internet portal www.agate.ch. Median age of the cows was 6.9 years, number of calves per cow was 2.5 and median period between last calving and slaughter was 1.5 years. In 13 from 21 of the urogenital tracts examined, macroscopic abnormalities of the ovaries and\/or histologic or microbiologic findings in the uterus could explain fertility-associated slaughter.","375":"Listeria (L.) monocytogenes is widely distributed in the environment, but also has the ability to cause serious invasive disease in ruminants and humans. This review provides an overview of listeriosis in ruminants and discusses our insufficient understanding of reservoirs and possible cycling ofL. monocytogenes between animal and human hosts, food and the environment. It indicates gaps in our knowledge of the role of genetic subtypes in L. monocytogenes ecology and virulence as well as risk factors, in vivo diagnostics and pathogenesis of listeriosis in ruminants. Filling these gaps will contribute to improving the control of L. monocytogenes and enhancing disease prevention. As the prevalence of listeriosis in ruminants in Switzerland is likely to be underestimated, propositions concerning improvement options for surveillance of listeriosis in ruminants are provided.","376":"","377":"","378":"","379":"An outbreak of foot rot occurred in the ibex colony \"Vanil Noir\" in Switzerland from May to December 2014. This article describes field observations and the analyses carried out on the limbs of 3 animals submitted for postmortem examination. Disease signs observed in the field included lameness, poor body condition and overgrown hooves. Macroscopic examination of selected limbs revealed severe lesions in all of them, including interdigital inflammation with ulceration and malodorous exudation. Histological changes were consistent with chronic laminitis with bone resorption, which was not detected at radiographical examination. Grocott-positive organisms compatible with Dichelobacternodosus were detected in the lesions. Samples collected from the lesions were positive by polymerase chain reaction for benign D. nodosus, which is typically associated with only mild lesions in domestic sheep. Whether D. nodosus is endemic in the colony or had previously been transmitted from sympatric domestic livestock is unclear. The unusual warm and humid weather conditions in 2014 may well have contributed to the outbreak.","380":"In Switzerland sarcoptic mange is frequent in free-ranging wild carnivores but until recent years no cases had been recorded in wild ungulates. Since 2010, cases have been observed in wild boar in the cantons of Solothurn, Tessin and Thurgau. Here, we report the detection of mange-like skin lesions in wild boars by photo-trapping and the post-mortem findings in 6 culled animals presenting different stages of the disease. Potential sources of infection include mangy red foxes, outdoor domestic pigs and wild boars from surrounding countries. Disease spread in the wild boar population may become relevant not only for wildlife but also for domestic pig health in the future if piggeries' biosecurity is insufficient to prevent interactions with wild boar.","381":"The need for wildlife health surveillance has become increasingly recognized. However, comprehensive programs which cover a wide spectrum of species, pathogens and geographic areas are still lacking in most European countries and practical examples of systems in place remain scarce. This article provides an overview of the organization of wildlife health surveillance in Switzerland, with a focus on the development, current strategies and the activities of the national program carried out by the Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health (FIWI), University of Bern. This documentation may stimulate on-going discussions on the design and development of national wildlife health surveillance programs in other countries. Investigations into wildlife health in Switzerland date back to the 1950s. The FIWI acts as a national competence center for wildlife diseases on mandate of the Swiss federal authorities. The mandate includes four main activities: disease diagnostics, research, consulting and teaching. In line with this, the FIWI has made continuous efforts to strengthen a national network of field partners and implemented strategies to facilitate long-term and metastudies.","382":"The value of wildlife has long been ignored or under-rated. However, growing concerns about biodiversity loss and emerging diseases of wildlife origin have enhanced debates about the importance of wildlife. Wildlife-related diseases are viewed through these debates as a potential threat to wildlife conservation and domestic animal and human health. This article provides an overview of the values we place on wildlife (positive: socio-cultural, nutritional, economic, ecological; and negative: damages, health issues) and of the significance of diseases for biodiversity conservation. It shows that the values of wildlife, the emergence of wildlife diseases and biodiversity conservation are closely linked. The article also illustrates why investigations into wildlife diseases are now recognized as an integral part of global health issues. The modern One Health concept requires multi-disciplinary research groups including veterinarians, human physicians, ecologists and other scientists collaborating towards a common goal: prevention of disease emergence and preservation of ecosystems, both of which are essential to protect human life and well-being.","383":"","384":"","385":"We present the clinical findings, diagnosis and treatment of an 11-year old intact male Fox Terrier with a malignant Leydig cell tumor of the right testicle, which metastasized to the skeletal musculature of the left hind limb. The primary tumor and the metastasis were resected with narrow margins. The dog was treated with metronomic chemotherapy using thalidomid and dyclophosphamide. Local recurrence at the site of the metastasis and a pulmonary metastasis were present 30 months after surgery. The dog was euthanized.","386":"This case report describes a combination of negative pressure-wound-therapy (NPWT) and NPWT assisted incision management after resection of an abscess located at the right thoracic wall in a Rottweiler. The patient had a history of severe incisional complications after surgical interventions performed in the past, including repeated episodes of wound dehiscence, major skin necrosis and infection with and without a multiresistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus and several episodes of open wound management with healing rates between months and a year. Wound closure after resection of the mass was performed as a staged procedure. After two days of open NPWT the wound was primarily closed and a preventive incisional vacuum assisted therapy (CI-NPWT) was started for 7 days. The patient was discharged during therapy with the portable device in place. The Unit was removed at day 7 post wound closure, suture removal followed at day 10. Wound healing was uneventful and no major complications occurred at a follow up time of 8 months. This is the first description of closed incisional negative pressure wound therapy in the dog.","387":"The aim of the study was to investigate the infection dynamic of Haemophilus (H.)parasuis and Mycoplasma (M.) hyorhinis in 3 farms. A total of 61 piglets were clinically investigated at 1., 3., 5., 7., 9., 11., 14., 18. and 22. weeks of life and a blood sample was taken from each piglet as well as from the sows. The serum samples were tested using ELISA for antibodies against H. parasuis and M. hyorhinis. Clinical signs indicating polyserositis were seen in farm 1 and 3. For both pathogens, a decline of the maternal antibodies could be detected up to the 5th or 7th week of life. The duration of persistence depended on the level of the maternal antibodies. In farm 1, all animals were tested positive for antibodies against H. parasuis during the fattening period. In farm 3, several sows were tested positive in the M. hyorhinis ELISA, therefore, positive results in sows can indicate a higher infection dynamic during the fattening period. For H. parasuis as well as for M. hyorhinis a significant correlation between the level of the antibodies in the sows and their piglets could be seen.","388":null,"389":"","390":"","391":"","392":"","393":"","394":"The present case report describes a stray cat with a female appearance.

The owners of the cat were interested to know the cause of the abnormal behaviour, but forbid any further clinical tests or surgery. Based upon cytogenetic and molecular genetic experiments a diagnosis became possible. The uniform karyotype (38,XY) was in accordance with the karyotype of a male cat and it was possible to amplify the SR Y gene by PCR. The cat represents a case of SRYpositive sex reversal.","395":"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is often the cause of mastitis problems in dairy herds and causes great economic losses. In this study, isolates from a dairy herd with a known S. aureus mastitis problem were examined by means of molecular methods (spa typing, PFGE, and DNA microarray) to investigate their epidemiological relationship and the success of intervention measures. The investigated dairy farm has a herd size of 60 cows and uses a fully automated milking system for milk production. A S. aureus strain, which contaminated the automated milking system and was subsequently spread among the herd through the latter, was suspected to be the origin of the mastitis problem within the herd. Thanks to the applied molecular methods, the common origin of the S. aureus isolates from the collected milk and swab samples could be shown. By culling chronically infected cows, optimising dry cow management and ensuring reliable intermediate cluster disinfection, the bulk milk somatic cell count improved.","396":"This retrospective study evaluated the frequency, etiology, therapy and prognosis of animal poisoning registered from 2003 to 2012. The relevant cases reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Center (STIC) were compared with those from previously examined periods. Human medicines not approved for animals and pesticides represented the most common causes of poisoning in dogs. Novel cases occurred as a consequence of the exposure of dogs to ricinus fertilizers, grape residues from wineries, pepper lachrymatory spray and dry bouillon. Cats are still freequently poisoned by pyrethroid drugs that should be administered only to dogs. Agrochmical products are the main source of toxicities in farm animals. Most poisonings in horses and exotic animals took place due to toxic plants. In addition, two tigers died of a secondary poisoning after ingestion of meat from euthanized calves.","397":"","398":"","399":"","400":"","401":"","402":"","403":"The case report describes the symptoms and diagnostic methods of a spina bifida aperta in a new born lamb. The most relevant clinical findings were recumbency immediately after birth with normal consciousness and suckling reflexes, alterations of the skin and coat in the lumbosacral region as well as dysuria. The biochemical and haematological screening of the blood indicated no abnormalities. While the radiological examination of the spine showed no clear evidence of the cause of the clinical sings the ultrasound and computed tomography examination revealed an incomplete closure of the vertebral arch between the 4th lumbar and the 3rd sacral vertebrae. Additionally, a hernia with similar density to the spinal cord was present in the same region of the spine. Based on the findings the lamb was euthanized. The pathological examination confirmed the incomplete closure of the vertebral arch and moreover a myelomeningocele has been diagnosed. In the histopathological examination the white and grey matter were separated in the area of the macroscopic visible lesions. Due to non-specific clinical symptoms imagining diagnostics can be crucial to confirm the diagnosis of this rare syndrome.","404":"Information on composition of uroliths collected between 2003 and 2009 from dogs in Switzerland and epidemiologic data of affected dogs are summarised in this paper. Of 490 stones analysed 44% were composed of calcium oxalate, 330% of struvite, 80% of silica, 7% of urate, 3% of cystine, 3% were mixed stones and 1% each were calcium phosphate and xanthine stones. Compared to other dogs, Norwich Terriers, Norfolk Terriers, Miniature Schnauzers, Miniature Pinscher and Yorkshire Terriers had a significantly increased risk to suffer from calcium oxalate stones, Dalmatians and Continental Bulldogs from urate stones and English Bulldogs from cystine stones. No breed had an increased risk of struvite or silica stones. Stones composed of silica were more prevalent in Switzerland compared to other countries and were more common in the eastern part than in the western part of Switzerland. This study shows that there are differences in occurrence and prevalence of uroliths between Switzerland and surveys of other countries.","405":"The goal of this study was to investigate whether administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) would improve the outcome of cows with malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). The study population consisted of ten healthy control cows and 22 cows with MCF. Nineteen cows with MCF and all of the controls were treated with either 2'500 U IL-2 or 25'000 U IL-2, administered intravenously. Three cows with MCF were not treated with IL-2 (MCF controls). All of the cows with MCF received danofloxacin, flunixin meglumine and intravenous fluid therapy. Blood samples for haematological and biochemical evaluation were collected once daily for six days in all cows. Of the 19 cows treated with IL-2, 13 were eutha nized because of deterioration. All cows with MCF that did not receive IL-2 died. The clinical condition of six cows treated with 2'500 U IL-2 gradually improved. Sur viving cows had significantly higher total leukocyte counts than cows that died or were euthanized. The main reason for leukopenia in non-surviving vs. surviv ing cows was persistent lymphopenia. Use of the lower IL-2 dose was associated with clinical recovery in some cows and this treatment might therefore be considered in valuable cows, provided that the lymphocyte count is within the reference interval.","406":"","407":"","408":"","409":"","410":"","411":"","412":"","413":"","414":"","415":null,"416":null,"417":null,"418":null,"419":"","420":"","421":"","422":"","423":null,"424":null,"425":null,"426":null,"427":"","428":null,"429":null,"430":null,"431":null,"432":"","433":"","434":"","435":"","436":null,"437":null,"438":null,"439":null,"440":"","441":"","442":null,"443":null,"444":null,"445":null,"446":"","447":"","448":"","449":null,"450":null,"451":null,"452":null,"453":null,"454":"","455":"","456":"","457":"","458":"","459":null,"460":null,"461":null,"462":null,"463":"","464":null,"465":null,"466":null,"467":"","468":"","469":null,"470":null,"471":null,"472":"","473":null,"474":null,"475":null,"476":null,"477":"","478":null,"479":null,"480":null,"481":null,"482":"","483":null,"484":null,"485":null,"486":null,"487":null,"488":null,"489":"","490":"","491":"","492":null,"493":null,"494":null,"495":null,"496":"","497":null,"498":null,"499":null,"500":null,"501":"","502":"","503":"","504":"","505":"","506":null,"507":null,"508":null,"509":null,"510":"","511":"","512":"","513":null,"514":null,"515":null,"516":null,"517":null,"518":"","519":null,"520":null,"521":null,"522":null,"523":"","524":"","525":"","526":"","527":null,"528":null,"529":null,"530":null,"531":"","532":"","533":null,"534":null,"535":null,"536":null,"537":null,"538":null,"539":"","540":"","541":"","542":null,"543":null,"544":null,"545":null,"546":"","547":"","548":"In April 2008 a Franches-Montagnes colt was born with an unusual coat colour phenotype which had never been observed in that population before. The foal showed extended white markings on body and legs, a white head and blue eyes. As both parents have an unremarkable bay coat colour phenotype, a de novo mutation was expected in the offspring and a candidate gene approach revealed a spontaneous mutation in the microphthalmia associated transcription factor gene (MITF). A detailed clinical examination in 2010 indicated an impaired hearing capacity. As in the American Paint Horse large white facial markings in combination with blue eyes are associated with deafness, the hearing capacity of the stallion was closer examined performing brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAER). The BAER confirmed bilateral deafness in the Franches-Montagnes colt. It is assumed that the deafness is caused by a melanocyte deficiency caused by the MITF gene mutation. Unfortunately, due to castration of the horse, the causal association between the mutation in the MITF gene and clinical findings cannot be confirmed by experimental matings.","549":"Aim of this study is to present a survey of the dog population and breed distribution in Switzerland from 1955 to 2008 as basis to realize a population based canine cancer register for Switzerland. The number of dogs rose from 309'000 in 1955 to approximately 500'000 in 2008 correlating with a parallel increase of human population. The ratio of dogs per 100 inhabitants remains stable. This ratio is lower in German speaking compared to French or Italian speaking Cantons. The variety and popularity of breeds changed from 1955 to 2008, \"winners\" are Labrador and Golden Retrievers, Yorkshire and Jack Russel Terriers.

Real-time B-mode ultrasonography and a linear or convex 5.0 to 7.5 MHz transducer are used to scan standing goats from both sides. The urinary bladder and urethra are also examined transrectally. The liver is scanned from the intercostal spaces (ICSs) on the right from dorsal to ventral. The parenchymal pattern consists of numerous fine echoes that are homogenously distributed across the entire organ. The dorsal visible margin of the liver runs parallel to the lung in a cranioventral to caudodorsal direction. The visible extent of the liver is largest in the 7th and 8th ICSs and the maximum thickness is measured in the 10th ICS. The caudal vena cava has a triangular shape in cross section and is seen only at the 11th or 12th ICS. The portal vein is oval to circular in cross section with stellate ramifications into the liver parenchyma. The gallbladder is pear-shaped and sometimes extends beyond the ventral margin of the liver depending on the amount of bile. In most goats, the gallbladder is only seen from the 9th or 10th ICS. The spleen is scanned from the left where it is almost always seen from the 11th and 12th ICSs. The parenchymal ultrasonographic pattern is similar to that of the liver. The splenic vessels are embedded in the parenchyma and are seen in longitudinal or cross section. The kidneys are best visualized from the flank and last two ICSs on the right. The ultrasonographic appearance varies with the sectional plane. In a sagittal plane through the hilus, the parenchyma is homogenous with fine, evenly distributed echoes. The medullary pyramids are seen near the sinus as oval to circular hypoechoic structures. The hyperechoic sinus is at the centre of the kidney. The urinary bladder is best visualized transrectally but can also be seen in many goats from either inguinal region. The content of the bladder is usually anechoic and the diameter ranges from 1.0 to 4.8 cm. The urethra is seen transrectally as two adjacent parallel echoic lines without an apparent lumen.","555":null,"556":"","557":"Two female spayed dogs belonging to the same owner were admitted for further examinations because of clinical signs and laboratory values compatible with hyperthyroidism. Sonography of the ventral aspect of the neck revealed small thyroid glands in both dogs. The hypothesis that the dogs suffered from alimentary hyperthyroidism caused by feeding head meat containing thyroid gland tissue was confirmed by consultation of the slaughtering plant, determination of iodine concentrations in deep-frozen samples and hormone measurements in 5 other dogs receiving head meat from the same supplier. After changing the diet, thyroxine concentrations declined and clinical signs were no longer observed.","558":"In this article the myocardial expression of different hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) isoforms in myocardial tissue from healthy control cats and cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was evaluated. Myocardial tissue samples of the left ventricle of control cats (n = 12) and cats with HCM (n = 4) were collected. Expression of feline HCN was determined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against HCN2 and HCN4. Optical densities of HCN bands were compared among groups by use of the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test. HCN4 was reliably detected in myocardial tissue whereas HCN2 was not. HCN4 expression was significantly increased in left ventricular (LV) myocardial samples of cats with HCM (P = 0.036) compared to control cats. Results indicate that myocardial HCN4 expression can be evaluated in cats by immunoblot analysis and that HCN4 expression is upregulated in LV myocardial tissue of cats with HCM. The pathophysiological importance of HCN overexpression with regard to myocyte function and altered automaticity deserves further study.","559":"Melanoma is the most common oral tumor in dogs, characterized by rapid growth, local invasion, and high metastatic rate. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combination of radiation therapy and DNA tumor vaccine. We hypothesized, that the concurrent use would not increase toxicity. Nine dogs with oral melanoma were treated with 4 fractions of 8 Gray at 7-day intervals. The vaccine was given 4 times every 14 days, beginning at the first radiation fraction. Local acute radiation toxicities were assessed according to the VRTOG toxicity scoring scheme over a time period of 7 weeks. In none of the evaluated dogs, mucositis, dermatitis and conjunctivitis exceeded grade 2. In 3 dogs mild fever, lethargy, and local swelling at the injection site were seen after vaccine application. In conclusion, the concurrent administration of radiation therapy and vaccine was well tolerated in all dogs.","560":"The behaviour of sheep was recorded as a reaction to the sound pressure levels caused by shooting with heavy machine guns. The reactions varied in intensity depending on the distance of the source of the noise from the fold. In the case of salvoes that were fired in the immediate vicinity of the fold and were associated with sound pressure levels higher than 120 dB (LCpeak), the sheep reacted with marked fright reactions, and no adaptation to the shooting noise was observed. It is concluded that the tolerable maximum noise level for sheep with this kind of noise source is likely to be less than 120 dB (LCpeak).","561":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sheep grazing communal alpine pastures with cattle can transmit Border disease virus (BDV) to cattle. A total of 1170 sheep and 923 cattle were tested for BDV using RT-PCR (sheep) and for pestivirus antibodies using an ELISA (cattle), respectively, before being moved to one of 4 pastures (A, B, C and D). Eight sheep from pasture C were viraemic. 396 of 923 cattle examined before the pasture season were seronegative. The latter were re-examined after the pasture season and 99 were seropositive or indeterminate. Antibody specificity was determined in 25 of these using a serum neutralization test (SNT). BDV infection was confirmed in 10 cattle and was considered likely in 8 others. BVDV infection was confirmed in 4 cattle and considered likely in 3 after pasturing.

The present case series describes 7 cats with primary hyperaldosteronism, which were presented between 2002 and 2011. Common clinical symptoms were weakness, anorexia, cervical ventroflexion and blindness. All cats showed hypokalemia. In 6 cats, blood pressure was determined: 5 cats showed hypertension, of which 4 animals exhibited retinal detachment and blindness. In the ultrasonographic examination, unilateral adrenomegaly was present in 6 cats whereas one animal showed normal adrenals. In 4 cats, the serum aldosterone concentration was above the reference range. Five cats underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, which was accomplished uneventfully and returned the electrolytes back to normal.

PCV2 was identified in only 4 % of cases by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Thus, PCV2 infections are of minor importance in respect to pig reproductive failures in Switzerland. Porcine parvovirus (PPV) infections were found in 3 % of the cases and seem to occur more infrequently compared to former findings. Hitherto, Enteroviruses\/Teschovirus were marginally studied in etiologically undefined cases with a prevalence of 11 %.

Occurrence of PMWS was predominantly in regions with a high frequency of swine farms (central and eastern Switzerland). Apparently it was spread to other, less affected regions, through trade of infected fattening pigs. Concurrently, disease was found in different establishments of production. Affected were mainly weaners or fattening pigs. In 40 % of the breeding farms and in 25 % of the fattening farms mortality rate was higher than 5 %. Starting in 2003, also a higher frequency of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) diseased pigs was diagnosed. In the years 2004 to 2006 they accounted for about 10 % of the diagnosed PCV2-associated diseases.

The cows were monitored and blood samples collected for 3 days to measure the concentrations of total and ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium and the activity of creatine kinase. The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the course of the disease. In each group 14 cows were cured. A rapid and significant increase in serum calcium concentration from the hypo- to the hypercalcaemic range occurred in both groups within 10min of the start of treatment, followed by a slow and steady decrease to the hypocalcaemic range. Calcium lactate did not prevent the calcium concentration from returning to the hypocalcaemic range, and the calcium profiles of the two groups did not differ significantly. As expected, treatment had little effect on the concentration of inorganic phosphorus in group A. In group B, treatment caused a rapid increase in the concentration of inorganic phosphorus to a maximum 20min after the start of treatment. This was followed by a slow decrease in the phosphorus concentration to the normophosphataemic range. Our findings confirmed that combined intravenous and oral administration of sodium phosphate in cows with periparturient paresis attributable to hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia results in a rapid and sustained increase in serum phosphorus, but not in serum calcium concentration. This modified therapy did not improve the success rate of milk fever treatment and further studies are needed to improve treatment of periparturient paresis.","599":"Health prophylaxis management practices have acquired a major role in the success of dairy herd health programs, however, little is known about the scope and level of implementation on Swiss dairy farms. The main objective of this study was therefore to provide a general overview of the most important preventive measures which are currently being used on these farms. In March 2011, an online survey with 75 questions was sent to 2'285 randomly selected Swiss dairy farmers. Response rate by question ranged from 35 to 53 %. Within this study, answers were compared between dairy farms with a tie-stall (n = 739) and farms with a free-stall (n = 458). Homeopathic treatments were used by 51 % of the dairy farmers and antibiotic dry cow treatments by 94 %. Farmers with a tie-stall tended to carry out more prophylactic treatments against external parasites, vaccinated their cows more frequently against Clostridium chauvoei and Moraxella bovis, and carried out claw trimming more frequently than dairy farmers with a free-stall. A higher proportion of dairy farmers with a free-stall had a written feeding plan, carried out regular feed analysis, wore an apron and rubber gloves during milking, and carried out post milking teat disinfection more frequently than dairy farmers with a tie-stall. The data collected in this survey could assist in improving future dairy health communication campaigns in Switzerland.","600":"","601":"A 3-year-old female intact Miniature Australian Shepherd presented with convulsive status epilepticus after milbemycinoxime administration in the recommended dosage. In addition to continuous intravenous antiepileptic therapy the dog had to be ventilated for 36 hours due to aspiration pneumonia. After extubation control of intermittent tonic-clonic seizures required a constant-rate-infusion of propofol for another 96 hours, before it could be discontinued on day 5. The patient had fully recovered by day 10. The dog was known to be homozygous for the MDR1-gene mutation. So far milbemycinoxime was regarded a save drug in MDR1-deficient dogs. However, the present case suggests using the lowest possible dosage in MDR1-deficient dogs and pet owners should be advised of potential complications.","602":"In veterinary medicine, limb-sparing techniques are most implemented when the uninvolved limbs are affected by other orthopaedic or neurological disorders, in large breeds or when the owner declines amputation. This report describes the surgical technique used for implantation of an endoprosthesis following tumour resection in the distal radius in 3 dogs using both standard and angle-stable plates. Endoprosthesis offers an easy and readily available surgical alternative to cortical allografts. Despite post-operative complications, this technique resulted in a good quality of life in all 3 dogs.","603":"This report describes an 8.8-year-old Simmental cow with squamous cell carcinoma of the reticulum and liver. The cow had calved recently and was referred to our clinic because of intractable fever, anorexia and progressive indigestion. The general condition and mental status were moderately affected and rectal temperature and respiratory rate were significantly elevated. There were no ruminal sounds and pinching of the withers consistently elicited a grunt. Serum activities of gamma glutamyl transferase, glutamate dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase were elevated. Radiographic examination of the reticulum and ultrasonographic examination of the reticulum, liver and abdominal cavity revealed multifocal, poorly demarcated, heterogeneous and echogenic changes in the liver. Biopsy of these lesions yielded a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The cow was euthanized and a postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. A 15 by 15 cm neoplasm was found in the reticular wall, and histological examination showed squamous cell carcinoma. It was assumed that the reticular mass was the primary tumour, which metastasized to the liver via the portal vein.","604":"In human medicine the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is one of the most commonly organ dysfunction scoring systems used to assess critically ill patients and to predict the outcome in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). It is composed of scores from six organ systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological) graded according to the degree of the dysfunction. The aim of the current study was to describe the applicability of the SOFA score in assessing the outcome of critically ill dogs. A total of 45 dogs admitted to the ICU was enrolled. Among these, 40 dogs completed the study: 50 % survived and left the veterinary clinic. The SOFA score was computed for each dog every 24 hours for the first 3 days of ICU stay, starting on the day of admission. A statistically significant correlation between SOFA score and death or survival was found. Most of the dogs showing an increase of the SOFA score in the first 3 days of hospitalization died, whereas the dogs with a decrease of the score survived. These results suggest that the SOFA score system could be considered a useful indicator of prognosis in ICUs hospitalized dogs.","605":"Streptococcus uberis is the most common environmental mastitis pathogen causing udder inflammations of different severities in dairy cows. The aim of the study was to investigate if the different clinical outcome of mastitis induced by different strains of S. uberis can be reflected in the mammary immune response. Mammary epithelial cells and somatic milk cells were treated with heat inactivated and living S. uberis of strain A and strain B in vitro. Strain A was repeatedly isolated from a chronically infected quarter during 8 months, and persisted in the quarter despite antibiotic treatment. Strain B caused an acute clinical mastitis and was not further isolated after a single antibiotic treatment. Treatment with Strain B induced a more pronounced increase of mRNA-expression of various immune factors (interleukin-8, interleukin-1beta, RANTES, and lactoferrin) in mammary epithelial cells than strain A. In contrast to mammary epithelial cells the response of removed somatic milk cells showed no differences between the stimulation with two S. uberis strains. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression was not differently induced by the two strains. In conclusion, the characteristics of different severities of mastitis that are induced by different S. uberis strains in vivo can also be reflected at the level of the immune response of the mammary gland in vitro.","606":"","607":"Intoxication with the beta2-agonist Albuterol may lead to immediate signs of beta-adrenergic stimulation like excitation, tachypnea and tachycardia. Furthermore, it typically causes severe hypokalemia, which then leads to muscle weakness and which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias. We describe a dog where albuterol intoxication caused runs of fast paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia that persisted after normalization of the hypokalemia. Based on a markedly elevated serum troponin I level acute myocardial damage was identified as cause of the tachyarrhythmia. Repeated Troponin I measurements and Holter-ECGs were the means to document complete cure.","608":null,"609":null,"610":"The aim of this study was to document experience gained with herd health management in veal calf production and to describe the calves' most frequent health problems. Fifteen farms with an 'all-in-all-out' animal flow system and 20 farms with a continuous animal flow system were investigated and data on animal movements, housing, feeding, medical treatments, and management were collected. Cadavers underwent pathological examination, and data were recorded from the carcasses of slaughtered calves. On the 15 'all-in-all-out'-farms, 2'747 calves were clinically examined by the contract-veterinarian upon arrival at the farm, and 71,1 % of the calves showed at least one sign of illness. The main causes of death were with 54,9 % digestive disorders (a perforating abomasal ulcer being the most frequent diagnosis), followed by respiratory diseases (29,6 %, mainly pneumonia). The meat color of 25 % of the carcasses was red. Calves from farms with the continuous animal flow system, which recruit mainly animals originating from the same farm, showed significantly better results regarding antibiotic use, performance and carcass quality than those calves from farms with the 'all-in-all-out'-system.","611":"","612":"","613":"","614":"","615":"Fifty Clostridium perfringens strains were isolated from individual dogs with acute diarrhoea that were not given antibiotics. Toxin types and minimal inhibitory concentrations of 15 antibiotics were determined for each of them. All strains harboured the alpha-toxin gene, 12 of them had both the alpha- and entero-toxin gene and 5 had both the alpha- and beta2-toxin gene. Eighteen percent of the isolates showed resistance to tetracycline and 54 % showed decreased susceptibility to metronidazole which is one of the most frequently used antibiotics in the treatment of canine diarrhoea. Apart from that, all isolates were susceptible to the remaining antibiotics tested. These findings lead to the conclusion that despite a general susceptibility to antibiotics in C. perfringens, resistance is developing in isolates from dogs. Therefore, careful identification of the pathogenic agent and antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed prior to therapy in order to minimise further selection of antibiotic resistance.","616":"Sepsis (S) and bacterial suppurative meningitis-meningoencephalitis (M-ME) are common causes of death in bovine neonates. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of S and M-ME in critically ill neonatal Piedmontese calves. Critically ill animals up to 15 days old referred by practitioners were registered according to their status and subsequently assigned to clinical standardized score. Calves with a clinical score &gt; = 5 were further assessed under a clinical and clinical-pathological protocol to strengthen the suspicion of S and M-ME. Critically ill neonatal calves sent for necropsy were included in the study as well. Fifty-nine calves were investigated, 26 of which referred alive and 33 dead. Ten out of the 26 clinically evaluated calves were classified as suspicious of S on the basis of the clinical and clinical-pathological protocols. S was confirmed by positive bacteriologic culture in 7 cases and in 3 cases on the basis of necroptic lesions. Concomitant suppurative M-ME suspected in 6 of these 10 calves was subsequently confirmed by CSF analysis or histological findings. Of the 33 calves examined only post-mortem, 20 showed pathognomonic findings of S and 14 signs of M-ME. The prevalence of S and M-ME was 46 and 36 %, respectively. Clinical signs of S were confirmed to be vague and overlapping with other diseases. The developed protocol was highly accurate in predicting S in these neonatal calves.","617":"The oral administration of calcium lactate for prophylaxis of bovine parturient paresis has been promoted for a number of years. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of this treatment on the serum concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium in parturient cows. Five fresh calved cows were given a drench containing calcium lactate and 5 control cows received the same drench but without calcium lactate. There were no significant differences in the serum concentrations of total and ionised calcium and magnesium between treated and control cows within 24 hours of treatment. Because the calcium lactate drench did not significantly affect calcium concentrations in the blood of fresh cows, it appears highly questionable whether the administration of calcium lactate decreases the risk of bovine parturient paresis. Based on our results, the oral administration of calcium lactate can not be recommended for prophylaxis of bovine parturient paresis.","618":"The following report describes the direct detection of Ehrlichia canis by real-time PCR in the conjunctiva of a 1-year-old female Maltese dog. After being imported from Brazil, the dog was presented because of anorexia, dehydration, fever, and palpable mandibular lymph nodes. A few days later, the dog developed bilateral blepharospasm, photophobia and anterior uveitis. Monocytic ehrlichia was diagnosed by a positive PCR result and the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies. Because of the massive uveitis a conjunctival sample was taken with a cytobrush, which also tested positive for Ehrlichia canis DNA by real-time PCR. Only one week after starting treatment with systemic doxycycline and local anti-inflammatory and cyclopalgic therapy the dog recovered from systemic and eye diseases. After therapy the follow-up examination revealed a full remission of clinical and hematological parameters and negative PCR result.","619":"","620":"","621":"In this retrospective study of 41 cats with chronic nasal disease diagnoses included nasal neoplasia (n = 19), idiopathic chronic rhinosinusitis (ICRS) (n = 12), nasopharyngeal polyps (n = 3), foreign bodies (n = 2), nasopharyngeal stenosis (n = 1) and nasal aspergillosis (n = 1). In 3 cats diagnosis could not be established despite thorough work-up. Gender, indoor or outdoor housing, quality or quantity of nasal discharge, bacteriological findings of nasal flushes, radiology and CT findings did not differ significantly between cats with neoplasia and cats with ICRS. Cats with neoplasia were older (3 - 15, median 11 years) and showed clinical signs for a shorter period of time (1 - 8, median 2 months) than cats with ICRS (age 1 - 13, median 7.5 years; signs: 1 - 36, median 5 months). In all cats with neoplasia a mass was detected rhinoscopically, while this was only seen in 30 % of cats with ICRS. The exact diagnosis has to be established by examination of biopsy samples. A combination of physical examination, imaging studies and rhinoscopy with cytological and histopathological examination of samples enhances the likelihood for a correct diagnosis.","622":"The purpose of the present study was based upon the first diagnosed bovine cutaneous leishmaniasis in a cow in Switzerland in April 2009. We continued descriptively the search for other bovine cases in Switzerland. We carried out similar investigations in the original farm where the case had occurred, and in parallel also in the neighboring farm. Additionally, veterinary practitioners sent us an overall of 12 suspected cases of bovine leishmaniasis. Following diagnostic investigations, all cases were negative for Leishmania. The occurrence of this infection appears therefore to be a very rare event. Finally some differential diagnoses are discussed.","623":"In Switzerland, annual surveys to substantiate freedom from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL) are implemented by a random allocation of farms to the respective survey as well as blood sampling of individual animals at farm level. Contrary to many other European countries, bulk-tank milk (BTM) samples have not been used for active cattle disease surveillance for several years in Switzerland. The aim of this project was to provide a financial comparison between the current surveillance programme consisting of blood sampling only and a modified surveillance programme including BTM sampling. A financial spreadsheet model was used for cost comparison. Various surveillance scenarios were tested with different sample sizes and sampling frequencies for BTM samples. The costs could be halved without compromising the power to substantiate the freedom from IBR and EBL through the surveillance programme. Alternatively, the sensitivity could be markedly increased when keeping the costs at the actual level and doubling the sample size. The risk-based sample size of the actual programme results in a confidence of 94,18 % that the farm level prevalence is below 0,2 %.

Since the number of notified cases was much lower than expected, the validity of the annually produced statistics with respect to the real situation in Switzerland was discussed controversially. In this study a questionnaire survey among physicians and veterinarians was carried out to evaluate the amount of and reasons for non-compliance with the mandatory notification. 81 % of the physicians and 97 % of the veterinarians reported the treatment of dog bite injuries in the year 2009. Among those, 60 % of the physicians and 41 % of the veterinarians indicated notification of less than 50 % of the treated cases.

Group C (carprofen) received intravenous (IV) carprofen, 4 mg\/kg, prior to anesthesia, whereas group P (placebo) received IV saline. General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen and a constant rate infusion (CRI) of sufentanyl IV. Intra-operatively, assessment of nociception was based on changes in physiological parameters and on the analgesics requirement, whereas in the post-operative period evaluation of pain was performed by using a Hellyer and Gaynor pain score and by comparing the doses of rescue buprenorphine required by the two treatment groups. Although no statistically significant differences in intra-operative sufentanyl doses were found between treatment groups, group C had superior cardiovascular stability, and lower post-operative pain scores and rescue buprenorphine doses than group P.

The control group consisted of 30 healthy adult domestic cats. A complete cardiac ultrasound was performed on all cats using right parasternal long and short axis views. There were few echocardiographic parameters in the Sphynx that differed from those of the healthy DSH. Only the left atrial (LA) dimension in 2D and M-mode, the left atrial\/aortic (LA\/Ao) ratio and the internal dimension of the left ventricle in systole (LVIDs) measured with M-mode were different. In conclusion, although the heart of Sphynx cat can often have a particular 2-D echocardiographic appearance, the M-mode cardiac dimensions are similar to those of the DSH.","640":null,"641":"In 2010, we observed again an increase in the number of declarations reported to the vigilance system for veterinary medicinal products up to a total of 160. The species and drug classes reported remained the same as in previous years: the majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) concerned either dogs or cats and the most frequently involved drugs were either antiparasitic products or antiinfectives. Adverse reactions following reconversions and 8 cases of suspected allergic reactions following the use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combinations in dogs were reported. Additional enquiries were processed by the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre and transmitted to Swiss medic. 11 of these reported accidental ingestions of flavoured tablets in overdose by dogs and some cats. The vaccino vigilance program received 179 declarations following immunization against blue tongue disease as well as 82 declarations following the application of other vaccines. The vigilance system increases the chance to identify rare reactions or interactions and thereby contributes to the security of veterinary medicinal products.","642":"","643":"A 10-year-old Swiss Braunvieh cow near term was referred to our clinic because of severe abdominal distension, which caused loss of demarcation between the udder and ventral abdominal wall.

Rupture of the prepubic tendon from the pubic symphysis was also suspected. Because of a grave prognosis, parturition was induced and a live calf was delivered. The cow was euthanized and a postmortem examination was carried out. The abdominal cavity contained 248.5 litres of clear fluid. The greater omentum was thickened and oedematous and regionally contained fluid-filled cystic structures, which varied in size with a maximum diameter of 10 centimetres.

The objective of this explorative study was to identify chromosome regions associated with ES. The studied population was comprised of two half-sibling sire families, involving a total of 222 horses. Twenty-six of these horses were affected with ES. All horses had been previously genotyped with 315 microsatellite markers. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) signals were suggested where the F statistic exceeded chromosome-wide significance at P &lt; 0.05. The QTL analyses revealed significant signals reaching P &lt; 0.05 on equine chromosome (ECA) 20, 23 and 25, suggesting a polygenic character for this trait. The candidate regions identified on ECA 20, 23 and 25 include genes regulating virus replication and host immune response. Further investigation of the chromosome regions associated with ES and of genes potentially responsible for the development of ES could form the basis for early identification of susceptible animals, breeding selection or the development of new therapeutic targets.","646":null,"647":null,"648":"","649":"","650":"","651":"","652":"","653":"A cutaneous mass in the neck was excised in a 13-year-old cat.

A particularly high absolute and relative longevity is also achieved by the anoa (Bubalus depressicornis), a member of the bovinae (cattle-type ruminants) and an insular dwarf (inhabiting the Indonesian island of Sulawesi). The fact that some (but not all) other small ruminants also achieve surprisingly high longevities leads to the hypothesis that extreme relative longevities in this group are an indication for secondary body size reduction.","661":null,"662":"Tracheal collapse is a progressive disease particularly of small breed dogs.

In this study an adapted method of endoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of caudal parts of the right cranial lung lobe was established and evaluated. The obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) served as template for the detection of BRSV, BPIV-3 and BCoV specific nucleic acids by RT-PCR. BALF samples of 44 cattle affected with respiratory disease were compared to nasal swabs in their reliability to detect the causative agent(s). In 6\/7 animals tested positive for BRSV, RNA of this virus was detected in the BALF, in 4 animals it could be found in the nasal swabs. In two of the three BPIV-3 positive animals, the BALF was the only material that tested positive. The most reliable samples for detection of 15 BCoV positive animals were the nasal swabs. BAL was easy to perform, it led to severe coughing in one case and moderate worsening of dyspnoe in three cases.

Killing decisions and their implementation often raise ethical questions. As a result of an interdisciplinary workshop targeting the subject \"killing of animals\" with veterinarians and ethicists, a three-dimensional dimension scheme was developed. Whereas the first two dimensions are focused on the animal's past and future life and are discussed with regard to life quality and life accomplishment (the \"telos\"), the third dimension incorporates the reason to kill and may integrate the concept of dignity. This form of dignity and the weighing of interests are applied to example scenarios and the resulting responsibilities of veterinarians and society are discussed.","693":"","694":"","695":"","696":"","697":"An Italian greyhound was presented three times during a two-year period for dental prophylaxis due to periodontal disease. Clinical examination revealed lesions on several teeth. Radiographs revealed extensive resorptive root lesions. On histological examination, the presence of odontoclasts and signs of boney remodeling of the roots confirmed the resorptive nature of the lesions. Given the extent of the lesions, and poor prognosis with conservative treatment alone, teeth affected by the most severe resorption were extracted at each visit using a flap technique combined with alveolar vestibular osteotomy. Dental resorptive lesions are rarely detected in the dog but may be more frequent than previously thought. The routine use of dental radiographs can be used to reveal these lesions in the dog.","698":"Atresia ani is the most common anorectal anomaly in small animals. In the present study, an anal stricture (atresia ani type I) in five 3 to 8 weeks old kittens and one 4 month old puppy was treated by balloon dilation. In 4 kittens and the puppy the stricture was eliminated permanently and without complications by a single intervention. Only the smallest kitten with the most severe stenosis developed a rectal fistula as a complication of repeated balloon dilation, which necessitated surgical correction. Balloon dilation proved to be an efficient therapeutic method for anal atresia type I, and can be recommended as the treatment of choice.","699":null,"700":"Various instruments and utensils used during milking as well as teat dip solutions were examined for contamination with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between contaminated fomites and udder infection in dairy cows. A total of 344 cows from ten dairy farms with the highest rate of clinical mastitis among the farms serviced by the Ambulatory Clinic of the University of Zurich were included in the study. Each farm was visited five times. All lactating cows, with the exception of those undergoing antibiotic treatment, were examined immediately before milking using the California Mastitis Test (CMT). A milk sample was collected from positive quarters. Items used to clean the udder, which included wood wool, paper towels and disinfecting towels as well as the milker's hands and the teat dip cup were swabbed for bacteriological examination. Water samples, samples of teat dip and cleaning solutions were also collected and cultured. Our results demonstrate that cleaning and disinfecting solutions have the potential to transmit udder pathogens and cause clinical mastitis. The most common CNS isolated from quarter samples were S. saprophyticus, S. sciuri and S. chromogenes, and the most common CNS isolated from utensils, cleaning and disinfecting solutions were S. fleuretii, S. vitulus, S. equorum, S. sciuri, S. haemolyticus, S. succinus and S. saprophyticus.","701":"In June 2008 the compulsary nationwide vaccination against BTV-8 (Bluetongue virus serotype 8) was started. After a short time, several owners complained about undesirable effects of the vaccination on fertility and milk quality. Data from 47 dairy farms, regularly supervised by herd health practitioners, were analysed in order to clarify a possible connection between vaccination and fertility. Both vaccinations given each cow for basic immunization were evaluated according to their effects on conception rate and pregnancy. In model calculations the first vaccination had no significant effect on the first service conception rate (FCR), the all service conception rate (ACR) and on the abortion rate. The second vaccination led to a significantly reduced FCR when the cow was inseminated within 20 days of being vaccinated and to a significantly worse ACR when inseminated 10 days before or after vaccination. However, these individually established reductions of the insemination rate had only little influence on overall data.","702":"","703":"","704":"","705":"","706":"Injuries of the superficial veins on the ventral abdomen of dairy cows can result in life-threatening haemorrhage. Treatment of these injuries can be difficult because of the characteristics of the veins. Five cows aged 6.5 to 12 years were referred to the Animal Hospitale Zurich, because of intermittent haemorrhage from a ventral abdominal vein. Four of the cows were near term and one had calved two weeks before referral. Intermittent bleeding was seen from the highly convoluted and dilated subcutaneous tributaries to the cranial superficial epigastric vein (milk vein). The haematocrit of 2 cows was markedly lower than normal. Emergency slaughter of one of the cows was carried out because of advanced age. The other 4 cows were sedated and after application of local anaesthetic, the wounds were debrided and sutured. Two of the cows required a blood transfusion before being operated. There were no postoperative complications. This type of injury seems to occur predominantly in pluriparous dairy cows close to term, in which the tributaries to the milk vein have undergone varicose changes. Treatment should consist of surgical resection of the injured tissue and suturing of the venous wall, subcutaneous tissues and skin.","707":null,"708":"Professional veterinarians are one of the most affected professions when it comes to killing animals. However, in some situations the opinion about the acceptance of killing of animals differs between people, which can cause a dilemma for the executing person. In a pilot study based on questionnaires, veterinarians from different working fields and students of different branches stated their acceptance of killing of animals in diverse concrete situations. The result clearly demonstrates a higher acceptance of killing of animals among veterinarians with longtime experience in contrast to other groups and the almost same acceptance among agricultural students. The acceptance increased with age, however, we could not find a gender specific difference except of within a narrow age interval. The variability of acceptance within the same profession group differs between the situations. Veterinarians should be aware of their different thinking about killing of animals in some situations compared to other people and should know the reason of such differences. This is important not least to protect themselves and their opinion and to contribute to their societal responsibility by their veterinarian activity.","709":"","710":"","711":"","712":"","713":"This report describes a 2.8-year-old Swiss Braunvieh heifer with conjunctival changes as the lead clinical signs of malignant lymphoma. The heifer was referred to our clinic because of conjunctivitis that did not respond to treatment with antibiotics. The patient had bilateral lacrimation, severe swelling of the third eyelids and prolapse of the conjunctivae, which were erythematous and covered with haemorrhagic crusts. A clinical examination revealed enlarged prescapular and prefemoral lymph nodes. Based on cytological examination of a fine needle aspirate from a prescapular lymph node, a tentative diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was made. The heifer was euthanased and a postmortem examination carried out. The conjunctival lesions consisted of diffuse multifocal nodules of varying size. There was generalised lymphadenopathy and beige nodules were seen in several internal organs. Histological and immunohistological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of multicentric leukosis characterised by T-cell lymphoblasts, which had also infiltrated the conjunctivae. Examination of a blood sample for enzootic bovine leukosis virus yielded a negative result.","714":"Juvenile sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis is a rare immune-mediated skin disease in young dogs. History, signalment, diagnostics, treatment, and outcome in 10 dogs are described. The age ranged from 8 - 36 weeks.

Seven dogs suffered from blepharitis and painful edema of the muzzle with hemorrhagic discharge, pustules and papules. Cytology of pustules and lymph node aspirates revealed a pyogranulomatous inflammation. In 7 cases the diagnosis of juvenile sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis was confirmed by histology. Nine dogs were treated with prednisolone (0.5 - 1.25 mg\/kg BID), H2-receptor antagonists and analgetics; all dogs were treated with antibiotics. Four dogs were treated with eye ointment containing antibiotics and glucocorticoids. The prednisolone dosage was tapered over 3 - 8 weeks. One dog had a relapse.","715":"Increased public awareness of the welfare and well-being of laboratory animals in biomedical research and related ethical considerations inspired us to review recent developments and recommendations for the care and housing of laboratory cats. The present review focuses on the practical requirements for maintaining domestic cats as laboratory animals - from the construction of animal shelters to the termination of an experiment. An excellent standard of housing and care will reduce the bias of experimental results due to stress. To provide cats with living conditions that best meet their natural physical requirements and permit natural social behaviour, laboratories should spare no effort to achieve high housing standards. Hence, the present report not only aims to be a practical reference for those who are involved in the care and husbandry of cats, but it also aims to motivate researchers to improve their knowledge in this field and to provide humane conditions for all cats kept for scientific purposes.","716":"","717":"","718":"","719":"","720":"","721":"","722":null,"723":"Three cases of fatal septicaemia due to Plesiomonas shigelloides and one due to Edwardsiella tarda were diagnosed in newborn penguins from the Basle Zoo, Switzerland from 2003 to 2007.

Dogs with HAC like symptoms, where HAC had been ruled out, served as controls (n = 18). All dogs with adrenal HAC, as well as 9 dogs with pituitary HAC had an ACTH concentration below the detection limit of 2.2 pmol\/l (10 pg\/dl) plasma. Using 2.2 pmol\/l as a cut-off the sensitivity and specificity to diagnose pituitary HAC was 0.82 (95 % CI 0.686 - 0.914) and 1 (95 % CI 0.692 - 1), respectively. With the help of the chemiluminometric assay, a correct classification was possible in 85 % of patients with HAC. As an ACTH-concentration below the detection limit was found in dogs with adrenal as well as pituitary HAC, additional discriminatory tests are necessary in these cases.","725":"The clinical signs, pathological and laboratory findings of cattle suffering from a tremorgenic syndrome are described. Animals on a farm with a total of 22 cows, 18 heifers and 9 calves were fed mouldy grass and spent malt-grain silage. Five heifers were affected with muscular tremor, hyperexcitability and hypersensitivity. They were ataxic or in sternal recumbency, while their appetite remained normal. Haematology and blood chemistry in two heifers as well as cerebrospinal fluid from one sick animal were unremarkable. The pathological examination of one animal brought no macroscopic changes to light. Histological examination, however, revealed the degeneration of motor neurones in the midbrain, brain stem and spinal cord. Analysis of a silage sample provided evidence of the presence of Aspergillus clavatus, a mould capable of producing neurotoxic tremorgenic mycotoxins.

Suddenly hypertension and tachycardia were observed, followed by foamy airway secretion and then severe airway hemorrhage. The authors hypothesize that laryngeal spasm provoked respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. The delivered high concentrations of sevoflurane probably enhanced a hyperadrenergic response, predisposing to the development of airway hemorrhage.","732":null,"733":"The ultrasonographic appearance of the normal abdominal wall in the flank region was investigated before and after exploratory laparotomy in five cows (group A). The results were compared with those after surgical correction of left displaced abomasum in 10 cows (group B) and of caecal dilatation in another 10 cows (group C). We hypothesized that in group C and group B, wound healing would be impaired because of the higher risk of complications compared to group A. A 10.0 MHz linear transducer was used to examine the abdominal wall immediately before exploratory laparotomy and for 10 days (groups B, C) or 30 days (group A) postoperatively. The thickness of the individual layers of the abdominal wall was determined. The skin and the individual muscle layers could be well differentiated via ultrasonography in all the cows preoperatively. In group A, the total thickness of the abdominal wall ranged from 2.80 to 3.40 cm; the skin and the subcutaneous tissues were 0.60 to 0.80 cm, the external abdominal oblique muscle 0.50 to 0.70 cm, the internal abdominal oblique muscle 0.50 to 0.70 cm, the transverse abdominal muscle 0.50 to 0.75 cm, and the transverse fascia and peritoneum were 0.20 to 0.30 cm. Groups B and C had similar findings. There was no significant difference in the course of healing, the thickness of the abdominal wall or thickness of the individual layers during healing among the three groups of cows. Features of healing included subcutaneous emphysema in 19 cows, seroma in 19 and haematoma in 2 cows. However, the occurrence of these events did not differ significantly among the three groups. Ultrasonographic examination of the wound on day 10 postoperatively was unremarkable in 24 cows.

CNS dominated as causal microorganisms of mastitis in small ruminants. By restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the groEL gene and sequencing of 16S rDNA, various CNS species were identified, albeit certain of them predominated. For susceptibility testing of mastitis pathogens to selected antibiotics, minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined. Of the 67 S. aureus and 208 CNS strains, 31.3 % and 8.2 % were resistant to penicillin, 29.9 % and 1.0 % to ampicillin, 1.5 % and 10.6 % to erythromycin, and 3.0 % and 7.7 % to tetracycline, respectively. Moreover, 10 CNS strains (4.8 %) were resistant to oxacillin and one CNS strain to sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim.

The aim of the study was to overview the reproductive performance of the Herens breed by analyzing data sets of the Herens Breeding Book and of the Animal Traffic Database of Switzerland. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to the breeders concerning aspects of management and care to identify a possible influence on the reproductive performance of the animals. Based on 4988 lactations starting in 2003, an average interval of calving to first insemination of 86 days a calving to conception interval of 146 days and an inter calving period of 431 days could be calculated. Conception rate resulted in 39.1%, the fertility index was 1.87 and 6.5% of all cows were culled because of fertility problems. Half of the breeders owned 4 or less cows. The most important reason for keeping Herens cows was cow fighting. Traditional alpine pasturing and cow fight rules resulted in a seasonal calving with 80% of the births taking place between October and December. The calving month and seasonal calving were the most important reasons for a prolonged calving to conception interval.","741":null,"742":"The present study describes the occurrence of intestinal parasite infections in livestock guardian dogs and herding dogs.

An epidemiological outbreak investigation was conducted with the aims to identify the source of introduction of the bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV-1) into the affected herds and to prevent further spread of the disease. The attack rates in the three outbreak farms were 0.89, 0.28 and 0, respectively. BoHV-1 could be isolated from nasal swabs of two animals originating from one of the affected farms. Comparative restriction enzyme analysis revealed slight differences between the isolates of the two animals, but a high similarity to previous BoHV-1 isolates from the canton of Jura, as well as to a French BoHV-1 isolate. This IBR outbreak has shown the importance of reporting and analyzing abortions. The current disease outbreaks recall the main risk factors for the spread of IBR in Switzerland: purchase and movement of bovines and semen of often unknown IBR status.","745":"A 6 years old female bernese mountain dog was seen for a nodular and erythemato-edematous dermatosis resistant to therapy. The histopathological exam showed a eosinophilic cellulitis with flame figures, which are caracteristic for the Wells' syndrome in human.

The cutaneous lesions worsened however at the end of the antibiotic treatment, after reduction of the steroid dosage. The prescription of dapsone did not change the clinical image, which motivated the owner to euthanize the dog. This case report is presented to make practitioners aware of a rare but particularly challenging dermatological problem.","746":"A fattening pig with enlarged head and abdominal lymph nodes was examined. An aspirate of the abscesses did not produce a conclusive diagnosis. Only an excision with subsequent histological and bacteriological examination showed the mould Mycocladus corymbiferus (syn.

With the exception of one cow, intestinal motility was decreased or absent. Transrectal palpation revealed dilatation of the rumen in 47 cows and dilatation of the small intestine in 18. Faecal output was markedly reduced or absent, and the faeces were dark brown to black and contained blood. Nine cows were euthanized immediately after physical examination. Conservative medical therapy was instituted in two cows; however, both were euthanized a few days later because of deterioration in condition. Exploratory right flank laparotomy was carried out in 52 cows. Of these, 22 were euthanized intraoperatively because of severe lesions. In 27 cows, intestinal massage to reduce the size of blood clots was carried out; 11 were euthanized several days postoperatively because of deterioration in condition.

The questionnaire helped to obtain plausibility and timely relation of the reported disorders. 58 abortions in cattle and different herd health problems could be examined. Because there is no possibility to show that a vaccination itself leads to an abortion the results of proven causes of abortions prior and after Bluetongue vaccination were compared regarding their diagnosis. Due to the fact that diagnosis and solving rate of abortions did not differ before and after vaccination, the vaccination itself cannot be responsible for the abortions. Evaluation of different herd health problems showed that Bluetongue vaccination was not responsible for these disorders which often existed already prior to vaccination. Herd health problems generally have multifactorial causes what makes it difficult to asses the effect of Bluetongue vaccination in some cases.","750":"","751":"","752":"","753":"","754":"A 5-month old female Red-Holstein calf in poor condition was presented with a history of reduced appetite, respiratory disease and collapse.

Samples were collected from poultry raised in intensive farming at the slaughterhouse (n=102, group A) and in small scale rural farms (n=60, group B) as well as from wild birds (n=116, group C). PCR amplifications were carried out on DNA extracted from caecal samples. Molecular assays targeted the hipO gene for C. jejuni, the asp gene for C. coli and the 16S rRNA gene of H. pullorum\/H. canadensis. To differentiate H. pullorum from H. canadensis, PCR products were subjected to an ApaLI digestion assay. Prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter and enteric Helicobacter was significantly different among groups (p&lt;0.0001). Campylobacter infections were detected in all three bird groups (78.4% group A, 18.3% group B and 38.8% group C, respectively), Helicobacter infections were only detected in poultry, with H. pullorum infecting 68.6% of group A and 21.7% of group B birds. H. canadensis was detected in Guinea fowls (group A) and for the first time in pheasants (group B). Mixed infections by enteric Campylobacter and Helicobacter were shown in 53.9% of group A and in 5.0 % of group B.

Weight loss and chronic diarrhoea were the most commonly reported clinical findings. Among ancillary examinations (fecal analysis, gastroscopy, abdominal ultrasonography, rectal mucosal biopsy) the D-xylose absorption test provided the most useful information. Although clinical signs and laboratory findings are helpful diagnostic tools, a definitive diagnosis is only possible by histological analysis of the intestinal segment.","763":"The goal of this work was to answer the question of whether or not there are significant differences between cows with abnormal vaginal discharge and cows with the diagnosis of puerperal or chronic endometritis, using blood and urine parameters. In addition, cows with and without vaginal discharge were examined for significant bacteriological differences in uterine mucous samples. The question of false positive and false negatives from the diagnosis of endometritis was also investigated. A total of 35 matched-pairs (+\/-vaginal discharge) from 27 stables was examined 21 to 63 days post partum. The examination consisted of a rectal and vaginal exam, urine and blood samples as well as vaginal swab from the corpus uteri using a Folmer-Nielsen-Catheter. Based on the history vaginal discharge occurred more frequently in dystocia and retentio secundinarium. Cows with a history of distocia and retentio secundinarium showed significantly more vaginal discharge. Gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT; p=0.01) and cholesterine (p=0.04) were different in cows with endometritis. The bacteriology results showed a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.01) only for Escherichia coli and Arcanobacterium pyogenes. The Folmer-Nielsen smears\/endometritis showed a significant difference between the two groups (p&lt;0.01). In a multivariate analysis with final step-back procedure regarding endometritis Gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) and Betahydroxybutteracid (BHB) were significant different (p=0.02).

Because of the relatively low animal density, disease control measures in Switzerland focus on the immediate culling of infected animals. However, the use of vaccines as a supporting measure can represent an effective option to promptly contain an epidemic and to reduce the number of animals to be killed. A prerequisite for the success of vaccination is its early, rapid and purposeful implementation. Vaccinations can be cost-intensive and can entail restrictions in international trade. For the choice of the appropriate control measure it is therefore important to thoroughly assess the epidemiology, the economic consequences of the control measures and the acceptance of these measures by the environment. Because of their special epidemiology, vaccination has clear advantages as a preventive measure for vector-borne diseases.","765":"This case report describes the clinical, ultrasonographic and pathological findings in a five-year-old Swiss Braunvieh cow with extraskeletal chondroblastic osteosarcoma of the neck region.

Ultrasonographic examination of the mass revealed a chambered structure containing echoic material that was separated by hyperechoic septa. Chondroblastic osteosarcoma was diagnosed based on histological evaluation of a biopsy sample, and the diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem examination.","766":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a GnRH vaccine (Equity) on behavior and gonadal function in horses with unwanted behavior. The reason for the treatment was asked using a questionnaire and the findings of physical examination, rectal palpation as well as rectal ultrasonography, were recorded. The results of these examinations and the behavior of 21 mares and 10 stallions before the first and after the second administration of the GnRH vaccine were compared. In 84 % of all cases a decrease of the unwanted behavior could be observed. In the mares the ovaries were significantly (p &lt;or= 0.05) smaller after vaccination than before. The largest and the second largest follicle on the ovaries were also significantly smaller after vaccination. In the stallion there was no significant difference in the size of testicles before and after vaccination. The study showed that the vaccine is well tolerated in horses and only little local adverse reactions appeared in 6.5 % of all cases.","767":"The passive surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry is based essentially on the reporting of suspicious clinical cases by the poultry keepers to the veterinary services. As little was known about HPAI disease awareness among Swiss poultry keepers, a cross-sectional study was conducted among poultry keepers in Switzerland in 2007. For data triangulation and complementary information, interviews have been conducted with experts of poultry marketing organizations. The main information source used by the poultry keepers was mass media. Having a non-commercial poultry husbandry was significantly associated with lower knowledge scores. Non-commercial poultry keepers felt neglected by the veterinary authorities. Risks perceived by the poultry keepers reflected well the officially communicated risks for HPAI introduction. By highlighting the needs and the knowledge level of the poultry keepers, we make recommendations with regard to more efficient information exchange between poultry keepers and veterinary authorities. The main challenge will be to consistently integrate non-commercial poultry keepers in the formal information channels.","768":"A transdisciplinary project was undertaken by veterinarians and historians to investigate various aspects of potential zoonotic diseases that were classified, or have been seriously considered as reportable diseases in Switzerland (bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE], brucellosis, neosporosis, tuberculosis). Above all we were interested in the scientific and societal background which is necessary to declare an infectious disease being a reportable disease which needs to be eradicated. Results of this study have shown that the time interval between the first recognition of an infectious disease and the implementation of national control measures can vary greatly. In the post modern information based society, the interval between recognition of a new emerging disease and its eradication program becomes much shorter when the disease in question has a zoonotic potential. The historic correlation is not used as a history of progress. It is presented to explain the different recognition of risk and the broad context of measurements in society to fight against zoonosis.","769":"","770":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH), together with its accompanying clinical signs and underlying causes, e.g. pulmonary thrombosis, are more and more recognized as an important clinical entity also in dogs. This article characterizes the clinical picture of 3 dogs with PH caused by natural infection with Angiostrongylus vasorum. All 3 dogs were of small breeds ( &lt; 10 kg), the age at the time of diagnosis was 1, 2 and 11 years. Clinically, dyspnea and exercise intolerance were the predominating signs, 2 dogs developed hemoptysis, 1 dog developed right sided congestive heart failure. Severe arterial hypoxemia (PaO2 41 - 53 mmHg) reflected the severity of pulmonary parenchymal and vascular damage. Severe hyperglobulinemia (59 und 88 g\/l) in two dogs implicated a long lasting infection. Anthelmintic treatment in 2 dogs resulted in quick clinical, radiographic and echocardiographic normalization. PH is the consequence of multiple causes and pathomechanisms, and the recognition of PH is primarily of differential diagnostic relevance. Prognosis and therapy in cases with PH mainly depend on the underlying cause, rather than on the PH and on its degree.","771":"According to WHO classification hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary genetic cardiomyopathy. Echocardiographically HCM is characterized by symmetric, asymmetric or focal left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without recognizable underlying physical cause. However, echocardiographically HCM in cats may not be distinguishable from other causes of a thick appearing left ventricle. Hypovolemia can look like a hypertrophied ventricle but is basically only pseudohypertrophic. Well recognized and logical physical causes of LVH include systemic hypertension and outflow obstruction. LVH similar to HCM may also be found in feline hyperthyroidism. The context of the disease helps to differentiate these physical \/ physiological causes of LVH. Difficult to distinguish from HCM, particularly when based on a snapshot of a single echocardiographic exam, are myocarditis and &lt;&lt;steroid-induced HCM&gt;&gt;. Only the clinical and echocardiographic course allow a reasonably confident etiological diagnosis and the differentiation between HCM and secondary LVH.","772":"Boxer are predisposed to subaortic (SAS) and pulmonic stenosis (PS). To decrease the prevalence, pre-breeding cardiologic exams were performed in the last years. In our study the results of 309 pre-breeding exams of boxers presented between 1999 and 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. The overall prevalence of heart murmurs was 26.5 %. A SAS was diagnosed in 25 (8.1 %) and a PS in 10 (3.3 %) dogs. A combination of both defects was found in 7 (2.3 %) Boxers. Animals with a heart murmur of at least grade 3\/6 had a significantly higher peak aortic flow velocity (VmaxAo) than animals without or only soft heart murmurs. Over the study period both the frequency of heart murmurs and diagnosis of SAS and PS decreased.","773":"The development of pulmonary edema is divided in cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. Cardiogenic edema pathogenically is caused by elevated hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries due to left sided congestive heart failure. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is categorized depending on the underlying pathogenesis in low-alveolar pressure, elevated permeability or neurogenic edema. Some important examples of causes are upper airway obstruction like in laryngeal paralysis or strangulation for low alveolar pressure, leptospirosis and ARDS for elevated permeability, and epilepsy, brain trauma and electrocution for neurogenic edema. The differentiation between cardiogenic versus non-cardiogenic genesis is not always straightforward, but most relevant, because treatment markedly differs between the two. Of further importance is the identification of the specific underlying cause in non-cardiogenic edema, not only for therapeutic but particularly for prognostic reasons. Depending on the cause the prognosis ranges from very poor to good chance of complete recovery.","774":"","775":"","776":null,"777":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a primarily non-inflammatory enlargement of the prostate due to proliferation of its epithelial and mesenchymal structures. These physiological alterations can be found in more than 95 % of aged intact male dogs, but common clinical symptoms as serosanguineous urethral discharge, haematuria, flattened faeces, constipation and tenesmus are only present in a few of them. In addition to surgical castration, hormonal suppression of testicular function with GnRH-depot-analogues, inhibition of the 5alpha-reductase or peripheral androgen action with anti-androgens are available today. This enables the clinician to find the optimal therapeutic strategy for each patient.","778":"Gonadectomy irreversibly prevents reproduction by removing germ cells as well as gonadal hormones. Moreover, consequences of gonadectomy include metabolic alterations influencing the incidence of diseases, phenotype and behavior. The desirable and undesirable effects of castration on different organ systems and their relation to timing of gonadectomy are discussed. For reasons of disease prevention as well as ease of husbandry and control of pet overpopulation prepuberal castration of non-breeding cats is recommended. At the time of gonadectomy the risk for developing obesity and associated diseases as well as dietary measures should be discussed with the owner.","779":"The necessity, and in particular the timing of gonadectomy in dogs is still controversial. This is mainly because gonadectomy confers a mixture of benefits and adverse effects depending on age at neutering, breed and sex. On advising a client on gonadectomy, the frequency and consequences of the pros and cons should be balanced.","780":"The following case report describes a selenium toxicosis in a pig-fattening farm of two finisher groups. The diseased animals partly showed ataxia and paresis or intense lameness in connection with band-like ablation of the epidermis at the coronary band. Some of them suffered from alopecia. Foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular disease were excluded by serological tests. Dissection revealed a multifocal bilateral symmetric poliomyelomalacia. Histological changes in the claws ranged from severe cell-decay in the germinative layer to distinctive decay of the stratum corneum. Due to damage of the claw epidermis the corium was partly exposed. Feed analysis revealed 100-fold increased selenium content in the finishing premix from the feed mill and as a result 20- to 60-fold increased selenium values in feed samples from the farm-made finisher mixture. Selenium concentration in the blood of diseased animals was 4- to 10-fold higher than normal values, which confirmed the tentative diagnosis of a selenium toxicosis.","781":"Haemotropic mycoplasmas (or haemoplasmas) are the causative agents of infectious anaemia in many mammalian species. They were previously known as Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon species. The development of sensitive, specific PCR assays has expanded our knowledge of these agents and PCR is the method of choice to diagnose and differentiate haemoplasma infections. In felids, Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' have been described. They vary strongly in their pathogenic potential and co-factors may influence the disease severity. In dogs, Mycoplasma haemocanis and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum' are known; clinical signs are mainly found in immunocompromised dogs. Transmission of haemoplasmas may occur via infected blood (aggressive interaction, transfusion) or blood-sucking arthropods. Infections can be treated with Doxycycline, although it is disputable whether the infection is completely eliminated. Feline haemoplasmas must be expected in cats all over Europe, while canine haemoplasmas are mainly encountered in dogs in Mediterranean countries but should also be considered in Swiss dogs with a travel history.","782":"In the canton of Freiburg, in the midlands of western Switzerland, the influence of housing systems and season on the distribution of Chorioptes-mange was studied. 24 herds with a total of 667 dairy cows held in tethered and loose housings were considered. In the 14 farms with tethered housing 33.8 % of the dairy cows were clinically suspicious and 31.0 % parasitologically positive. In the ten studied farms with loose housing 26.5 % were clinically suspicious and 17.8 % parasitologically positive cows. Statistically the infestations of the two housing systems did not differ significantly (U-test, p &gt; 0.05). The transmission of mange occurs mainly directly from animal to animal, and chronically infested animals are considered to be the main source of infestation. The seasonality of Chorioptes-mange which is typical of our temperate climate was confirmed by serial studies made in two endemically infested farms with tethered housing.","783":"In Switzerland, bovine fasciolosis is an economically important but often overlooked disease of dairy cows. The intermediate host of Fasciola hepatica in Switzerland is Galba truncatula, an amphibious snail living in humid habitats which are infected by miracidia from recently hatched Fasciola eggs. The definitive hosts include cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and free-living ruminants. Infection of these hosts occur from metacercariae, usually encysted on vegetation. Infection risk depends on the location of the habitat on the farm. There is a lower risk for the intermediate host to become infected on pastures for young stock and dry cows than on pastures for dairy cows. This in turn results in a lower infection risk for young stock and dry cows than for dairy cows. When controlling the disease, epidemiologic factors such as treatment and pasture management strategies should be taken into account. If individual control measures are followed, infection pressure and prevalence in a herd can be significantly reduced. To support veterinarians and farmers in the control of fasciolosis, an interactive map showing potential risk areas for fasciolosis was created on the basis of geographical, meteorological, and biological data of the intermediate host and the free-living parasite stages.","784":"","785":"","786":"","787":"","788":"Hereditary equine dermal asthenia (HERDA) is an autosomal recessive skin disease that affects predominantly Quarter Horses and related breeds. Typical symptoms are easy bruising and hyperextensible skin on the back. The prognosis is guarded, as affected horses cannot be ridden normally and are often euthanised. In the Quarter Horse, HERDA is associated with a mutation in cyclophilin B (PPIB), an enzyme involved in triple helix formation of collagen. Here we describe the case of a Swiss Warmblood filly with symptoms of HERDA without PPIB-mutation and in which we also could exclude Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV, VI, VIIA, VIIB and VIIC (dermatosparaxis type) as etiological diseases.","789":"Symptoms, diagnosis, therapy and clinical outcome of 2 horses which acquired a complete rupture of the extensor carpi radialis tendon by accident are described. The resulting gait abnormalities are very typical, so that the problem can be diagnosed already by clinical examination. With the help of ultrasound the diagnosis could be confirmed and the degree of damage quantified. The open wounds in the carpal region were surgically treated in a standing position and the limbs of both horses were kept under a splint bandage for 6 to 8 weeks. Prognosis in these cases was good, as both horses returned within 6 months back to their previous work.","790":"Bacterial infections present a major challenge in equine medicine. Therapy should be based on bacteriological diagnosis to successfully minimize the increasing number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. The present study is a retrospective analysis of bacteriological results from purulent infections in horses admitted at the University Equine Clinic of Bern from 2004 to 2008. From 378 samples analyzed, 557 isolates were identified, of which Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and coliforms were the most common. Special attention was paid to infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ST398 and a non-MRSA, multidrug-resistant S. aureus clone ST1 (BERN100). Screening of newly-admitted horses showed that 2.2 % were carriers of MRSA. Consequent hygiene measures taken at the Clinic helped to overcome a MRSA outbreak and decrease the number of MRSA infections.","791":"African horse sickness (AHS) of equines is partly transmitted by the same culicoides species as Bluetongue (BT) disease in even-toed ungulates. Horses normally get seriously sick, with a high case fatality rate. Equine Encephalosis is another, but less-known viral disease of equines, caused by viruses of the same genus as BT and AHS. Like BT of serotype 8 in 2006, both diseases could theoretically be introduced to Europe anytime and spread rapidly then. After the lessons learnt from the most recent bluetongue outbreaks in Europe, the regulations and AHS-contingency plans in force must be updated. All stakeholders must be aware of the risks and take own measures to prevent a possible emergence of the diseases, and be prepared in case of an outbreak.","792":"","793":"","794":"","795":"","796":"","797":"This study reports the results in 34 dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). Rottweilers and Yorkshire Terriers were overrepresented. Most obvious clinical signs and laboratory findings were diarrhea (91 %), weight loss (74 %), anorexia (56 %), lethargy (51 %), ascites (18 %), ascites without gastrointestinal signs (9 %), hypoalbuminemia (&lt;12 g\/l, 65 %) and hypocholesterolemia (51 %). Ultrasonographic findings included intestinal wall thickening in 71 %, abnormal echogenicity in 68 %, and no abnormalities in 29 %. The most important endoscopic findings were diffuse and profound dilation of villi in 35 %, a more granular appearing mucous membrane in 32 % and a \"rice-grain\" appearing villus dilation in 12 %. In 21 % of the dogs the mucous membrane was considered unremarkable. Histologically, 62 % had lymphangiectasia, in 86 % of these associated with moderate to severe inflammatory infiltrates, and in 71 % associated with dilatation of intestinal crypts. In 68 % of the dogs lesions in intestinal crypts were found, 35 % of these without lymphangiectasia. In 12 % of the dogs the histological findings failed to explain intestinal protein loss. This study shows the important prevalence of crypts' lesions in protein-losing enteropathy.","798":"Three international panels have been established over the past 11 years to provide veterinarians with guidelines on the use of feline vaccines. These are the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) Feline Vaccine Advisory Panel, the World Small Animal Association Vaccine Guidelines Group (WSAVA VGG) and the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD). The major recommendations of these three panels are summarised to show areas of agreement and areas of discrepancy. While the recommendations of the three groups are not fully aligned, all agree that core vaccines (those that every cat should receive) include panleucopenia virus (FPV), calicivirus (FCV) and herpesvirus (FHV-1) (with the addition of rabies virus where it is endemic or mandated by law). All the panels also recommend booster vaccination for the three core vaccines at intervals of more than one year in many situations (up to every three years for FCV and FHV-1 after the first booster, and at intervals no more frequently than every three years for FPV after the first booster), in view of the studies evaluating the duration of immunity for these vaccines. Precise recommendations vary though, and further studies are needed to provide additional information to clarify areas of discrepancy and further refine recommendations for the future. Ultimately the aim should be to vaccinate cats less frequently (based on a knowledge of the true duration of immunity conferred by vaccination), but to vaccinate more cats (and ideally every cat).","799":"Antimicrobial resistance amongst organisms such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. pseudintermedius has become a serious threat to veterinary small animal practice. There is an urgent need to adopt measures which will control and reduce this problem. Risk factors for infection by resistant organisms in small animals are now becoming recognised and appear to mirror those in human medicine. They include contact with carriers or infected animals, hospital admission, invasive procedures and antimicrobial therapy. Key recommendations which enable such risk factors to be avoided are: development of protocols which ensure that antimicrobials are used only when necessary, selection of appropriate antimicrobials and compliance with correct dosage and administration, limitation of prophylactic and perioperative use, and recording of treatment outcomes so that therapeutic regimens can be evaluated and modified if necessary. In addition, there is a need for rigorous hygiene protocols to prevent survival and transfer of resistant bacteria in clinics and hospitals.","800":"Reptiles are presented in increasing numbers in the small animal practice. The most important cause for dermatopathies is inadequate management, especially species inappropriate temperature and humidity. This aspect has to be considered in the treatment. Infectious skin diseases in reptiles are frequently caused by mites, as well as by bacteria and fungi. The special importance of the fungal disease caused by Chrysosporium Anamorph of Nannizziopsis vriesii (CANV) in lizards is emphasized. Viral skin diseases are less frequently diagnosed. Shell necrosis in chelonians is an important bacterial disease. Frequent causes of non-infectious dermatopathies are dysecdysis and trauma. Hypovitaminosis A is the most common metabolic disease. Physical examination, diagnostic tests and therapy in reptile skin diseases are comparable to mammals, however, scientific data in reptiles are still scarce.","801":"There is widespread use of serum allergy tests which are promoted for identifying the reaction against certain allergens in atopic dermatitis, sarcoptes infestation and also food hypersensitivity in dogs. Around 20 years ago the first in-vitro tests were developed to identify allergen-specific IgE in dogs with atopic dermatitis. Since then, technical developments have markedly improved the quality of antibodies as well as the methods. The limitation of serum tests lies in the interpretation of test results as well as the diseases they are used for. This overview discusses usefulness and limitations in different skin diseases.","802":"The specialty of dermatology has the invaluable advantage to provide direct visual access to the organ of interest, which therefore is characterised by a complex and complete semiology. This allows the clinician to efficiently limit the differential diagnosis. However, whereas in most species the focus lies in the assessment of the primary lesion resulting directly from the underlying pathologic process, in cats the assessment of the lesions' localisation and distribution is more important. The goal of this article is to illustrate the importance of considering the lesions' distribution and resulting reactive pattern at least as much as the nature of the lesion itself.","803":"Disc herniation is one of the main research topics at the Tierspital Berne. In this review article about canine disc disease, results from recent clinical research are presented and integrated to the actual knowledge about the disease. These new results deal mainly with neurosurgery\/neuroradiology and especially focus on therapeutic value of commonly used treatment methods (hemilaminectomy, fenestration, durotomy, lateral corpectomy) in order to further improve therapeutical results in future.","804":"","805":"","806":"A four-year old goat was presented for anorexia and apathy since kidding one week earlier. Physical examination revealed dyspnea, extensive ascites and bilateral distended jugular veins, suggestive of congestive right heart failure. The echocardiographic findings of severe right ventricular and atrial dilatation were consistent with right heart failure. In the absence of abnormalities in the right ventricular outflow tract a diagnosis of cor pulmonale secondary to lung disease was posed. Due to a poor prognosis, the goat was euthanized. Necropsy confirmed cor pulmonale and identified severe chronic parasitic pneumonia as underlying cause. Echocardiography is an interesting tool also applicable in the farm for diagnosing heart diseases in goats, and its use should help to avoid unnecessary therapy in cases with a poor prognosis.","807":null,"808":"The behavior of 100 healthy dogs and 100 healthy cats was analysed during their physical examination from \"head to tail\". A complete physical examination was possible without restraint in 70 % of the dogs and 76 % of the cats. Only a partial examination was possible in 24 % of the dogs and 20 % of the cats. The physical examination could not be correctly performed in 6 % of the dogs and 4 % of the cats. 16 % of the dogs and 13 % of the cats showed aggressive or dangerous behavior. Male dogs were more frequently aggressive than bitches (p = 0.01).","809":"Infectious canine hepatitis in 4 Dogs in Switzerland. Four dogs presented with nonspecific symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and weakness. Laboratory results were consistent with hepatopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Three dogs died, one survived. In the three deceased dogs, a diagnosis of infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) was made based on histological findings and positive immunhistochemistry results for canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1). In the surviving dog, an antemortem diagnosis of ICH was determined via positive polymerase chain reaction results from blood, occular, nasal and preputial discharge as well as from urine. Since the introduction of widespread vaccination, the incidence of CAV-1 infection in dogs is low. However, the disease has not been eradicated and should be considered when clinical signs consistent with ICH are present.","810":"","811":"","812":"","813":"","814":"In the introduction I will start from a biographical novel on Friedrich Baumann, who was born in 1835 as an illegitimate child and later stood in high respect as building contractor, founder's president of the Swiss master builder's federation and politician, and we will look after his father who emigrated to America. In the following sections I will present the Batschelet family as well as the family of the veterinarian Christian Batschelet and the department for animal pharmaceutics of the academy in Bern. The time of the young veterinarian in Walperswil as well as his emigration and his life in the USA will also be examined and I will also introduce Christian Batschelet's son, Friedrich Baumann and his son, my father Erwin Friedrich Baumann.","815":"Rabies treatises of the 18th and 19th century are being researched in regard to their significance of the keeping of pets, which started to establish itself at the beginning of the 17th century. In doing so it is clearly recognizable that this keeping of pets had become a constant element of the civil urban life. The treatises also show that the physicians declined the keeping of dogs out of pure pleasure.","816":"The mankind has used the domesticated horse since the beginning constantly. The consequence was often lameness because of intensive wear of hoofsole. With different hoof-protective measures and devices mankind tried to deal this weakness. Finally the invention of the shoeing solved this problem. We probably owe this invention to a Scythian blacksmith from the 4th or 5th A.D. At the beginning horseshoeing was only sparingly used. Later improvements and innovations brought the breakthrough. Today every horse wears horseshoes.","817":null,"818":"The earliest recorded animal disease notification on the territory of contemporary Switzerland is found in the chronicles of the monastery of St. Gall and dates back to A.D. 941. Disease control in Switzerland began in medieval towns, with the regulation of livestock and the meat trade. Later, there were attempts to keep entire small areas such as valleys free of animal epidemics. Because livestock tended to be transported in one direction only - away from rural areas for sale in towns and for export - disease in animal-raising areas usually did not spread very far. Albrecht von Haller's epidemiological research from 1773 established the fundamentals of effective disease control. The cantons introduced extensive measures for protecting their territories on the basis of animal transport controls. With the development of the railways and the international livestock trade around 1850, the risk of animal epidemics increased considerably, leading to the need for measures on national and international levels. The first federal law on animal disease control was introduced in Switzerland in 1872, thus creating a nation-wide \"veterinary area\". In 1886 the law was amended to include mandatory controls of imported livestock and meat by a newly-created border veterinary service.","819":"","820":"","821":"","822":"In this retrospective study, the results of 3'527 eye examinations in 6 different breeds affected with Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) over a period of 8 years (1999 - 2007) are described. CEA was divided into three main ophthalmoscopic features, a) choroidal hypoplasia (CRH), b) CRH and coloboma and c) coloboma alone. Of the 101 Smooth Collies 8.9 % showed signs of CRH, whereas 36.9 % of Rough Collies were affected with CRH, 2.8 % with CRH and coloboma and 0.38 % with coloboma alone. Choroidal hypoplasia was present in 13.1 %, CRH and coloboma in 1.8 % and coloboma alone in 0.2 % of the Shetland Sheepdogs. Only one Australian Shepherd dog had CRH, while 0.7 % of the Border Collies were affected with CRH. None of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers were affected with CEA. There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of CEA between males and females, nor was there any relation between coat colors. Significant differences could be shown between dogs younger or older than 8 weeks at first examination. CEA was more often diagnosed in dogs younger than 8 weeks within the Rough Collie and Shetland Sheepdog.","823":"The importance of herd health management in Switzerland, its implementation by veterinarians as well as their willingness to collaborate within an Internet portal have been assessed by a questionnaire. The portal is meant to serve the genetic evaluation, the veterinary herd health management and the obligation to record treatments; it should be at disposal for all users in form of a central database. For the survey, questionnaires were sent to 784 veterinarians (mixed and livestock practices) in Switzerland. Amongst them, 217 (27.7 %) questionnaires could be evaluated. 125 veterinarians already offer a herd health management service and 147 veterinarians are inclined to collaborate in a central registration of animal health data. In this context, they are interested in an efficient veterinary herd health management program, which will allow direct exchange of data with farmers via an Internet portal. However, they fear a lack of interest of their customers and express some concern regarding data protection. The portal providers must therefore consider the needs of all potential users in order to succeed in this project. At this condition, the veterinarians are prepared to spread herd health management amongst the breeders by means of the animal health portal.","824":null,"825":"Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) are powerful pregnancy markers in domestic cattle. These proteins are expressed in mono- and binucleate trophoblast cells from the first days of gestation until calving. Different molecules were identified as being expressed at various stages of pregnancy. However, up to date, their functions and activities during pregnancy were not yet established. Specific RIA tests were developed (classic and alternative RIA) and used to measure the concentration of these glycoproteins in blood during gestation and the postpartum period in cattle. In maternal blood, PAGs rise to detectable levels from days 24 to 28 after fertilization. A recent study indicated that PAGs can also be detected in milk samples. However, concentrations in milk are much lower when compared to those of plasma.","826":"A five year-old bull moose (Alces alces) was culled due to chronic hoof overgrowth that required frequent intervention. Radiographic examination revealed changes in phalangeal bone structure usually considered indicative for laminitis in domestic cattle; similar changes were absent in the hooves of a free-ranging moose of similar age. The captive animal had been maintained in exhibits whose flooring were much harder than the soil in natural moose habitat, and on a diet with a high proportion of easily fermentable carbohydrates. These findings indicate that chronic laminitis should be considered as a potential underlying factor for hoof overgrowth, and that measures aimed at reducing the incidence of laminitis in domestic cattle, such as the use of softer flooring and diets with a higher proportion of fibre, might have prophylactic potential in captive wild ruminants.","827":"This case report describes the clinical, ultrasonographic and cystoscopic findings and treatment in a two-year-old Swiss Braunvieh heifer with rupture of a patent urachus. The lead signs in the seven-month-pregnant heifer were markedly abnormal general condition and demeanour and a pear-shaped abdomen. The heifer had severe azotaemia, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed ascites, which was diagnosed as uroperitoneum based on an elevated creatinine level in the fluid. A patent urachus was identified during cystoscopy; the endoscope could be advanced beyond the apex of the urinary bladder into the urachus. Based on all the findings, a diagnosis of uroperitoneum attributable to rupture of a patent urachus was made. The urachus was ligated twice via a left-flank laparotomy. The general condition normalised within a few days of surgery, and the patient calved normally and was in good health at follow-up evaluation.","828":"111 Domestic Shorthair cats with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were reviewed retrospectively. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to classify cases in 6 established phenotypes. Hypertrophy was diffuse in 61 % of cats and involved major portions of the ventricular septum and the left ventricular free wall (phenotype D). In the remaining cats, distribution of hypertrophy was more segmental and was identified on the papillary muscles exclusively (phenotype A, 6 %), on the anterior and basal portion of the ventricular septum (phenotype B, 12 %), on the entire septum (phenotype C, 14 %), or on the left ventricular free wall (phenotype E, 7 %). Echocardiographic characteristics and clinical findings were determined for each phenotype to study the correlation between distribution of hypertrophy and clinical implications. 31 cats demonstrated systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, 75 % of them belonged to phenotype C of hypertrophy. Left ventricular-outflow turbulences were identified more frequently with patterns of hypertrophy involving the ventricular septum (65.5 %), while prevalence of mitral regurgitation was higher when hypertrophy included the papillary muscles (phenotypes A and E, 85 % and 87 %, respectively). Left atrial dilatation occurred more frequently when hypertrophy was diffuse or confined to the left ventricular free wall (61 % of cats with phenotype D or E) rather than to the ventricular septum (31 % of cats with phenotype B or C).","829":"In this study breeders and owners of 8 different dog breeds (Beagle, Bernese Mountain Dog, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Great Dane, German Shepherd (GS), Labrador, Papillon, Sheltie) were interviewed to obtain information on puppy feeding in Switzerland. Besides answering a questionnaire (husbandry and feeding of the puppies), the participation in this study included weekly weighing of the animals as well as exact documentation of the amount fed to the animals. Totally 67 dog breeders and 131 new owners of puppies participated. The weight development of the puppies was mostly parallel to the growth curve in the GS, Labradors and Shelties. There were some substantial differences to the ideal growth curve within the other breeds. The daily mean energy requirement was estimated too high, when including the growth curves. 80 - 90 % of the recommendations would be sufficient for most animals. The calcium supply was in the range of tolerance in all breeds. Nearly all breeders used commercially available complete food while raising the puppies. No breed-specific differences could be shown.","830":"A 13-year-old male intact Golden Retriever was presented for chronic regurgitation and vomitus. The only clinical abnormality was halitosis, a neurological examination was normal. Thoracic radiography revealed a moderately distended, air-filled esophagus and a presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic megaesophagus was made. No other disorder causing abnormal esophageal motor function could be identified. As supportive and anticholinergic therapy failed to improve the dogs condition and ongoing regurgitation worsened, owners opted for euthanasia. Postmortem examination revealed a small (1.5 cm diameter) mass in the terminal esophagus. Microscopically a leio-myoma with mild multifocal mixed-cell esophagitis was diagnosed. This report illustrates how a potentially curable disease such as leiomyoma can clinically mimic acquired idiopathic megaesophagus and emphasizes that additional diagnostic procedures (contrast study, esophagoscopy) can be indicated in individual cases.","831":"A 4.5-year-old Swiss Braunvieh cow was presented to the Department of Farm Animals, University of Zurich, because of severe haematuria. All other clinical findings were within normal ranges. Transrectal ultrasonography revealed a 1 cm x 1 cm echogenic, irregularly-shaped, raised mass in the wall of the urinary bladder. Endoscopy identified the mass as a proliferation, approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, which was bleeding continuously. Thermocautery of the bleeding site was carried out twice five days apart via endoscopy. Clinical signs resolved for the remainder of the cow's life; she was slaughtered 15 months later because of infertility. Histological examination of the mass revealed a haemangiosarcoma.","832":"Trichinellosis is a worldwide occurring zoonosis caused by the intracellular nematode Trichinella spp. One of the main infection sources in Europe is raw or undercooked meat from wild boar. Trichinella britovi is prevalent in wild carnivores in Switzerland, thus a possible inclusion of wild boar in this wildlife cycle cannot be excluded. In order to assess the prevalence of Trichinella infection in wild boar, we tested 1,458 animals with both parasitological and serological methods. In none of the animals Trichinella-larvae could be recovered by the artificial digestion method (prevalence of larvae: 0 %; 95 % CI 0.0 - 0.3). Antibodies in meat juice were detected in 57 animals using a standardized E\/S-Ag-ELISA. However, in the confirmatory westernblot, only 3 animals remained seropositive (seroprevalence: 0.2 %; 95 % CI 0.07 %-0.60 %). The occurrence of wild boar positive for anti-Trichinella-antibodies indicates that meat inspection for Trichinella-larvae in this species is important to prevent human infections.","833":"Lyme borreliosis is the most commonly reported tick-transmitted infectious disease in the northern hemisphere in humans. Certain diseases are associated with Lyme borreliosis in the dog as well, but only intermittent lameness with articular swelling, lymphadenomegaly, fever, and anorexia were experimentally documented. Lyme borreliosis is considered an over diagnosed disease. The term \"Lyme nephritis\" was introduced for dogs with characteristic renal lesions and typical clinical signs, in which antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were found. Different studies have been aimed at showing a relation between renal disease and B. burgdorferi infection; however, this was not possible until now. Reasons for the uncertainty of the effects of B. burgdorferi in the dog are the high prevalence of circulating antibodies, the unspecific clinical picture and the inaccuracy of serologic tests.","834":"The purpose of this study was to valuate the prevalence of nuclear cataract in veal calves and to elucidate a possible impact by mobile phone base stations (MPBS). For this experiment a cohort study was conducted. A follow-up of the geographical location of each dam and its calf from conception through the fetal period up to slaughter was performed. The first trimester of gestation (organogenesis) was particularly emphasized. The activities of selected protective antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) were assessed in aqueous humor of the eye to evaluate the redox status. Of 253 calves, 79 (32 %) had various degrees of nuclear cataract, but only 9 (3.6 %) calves had severe nuclear cataract. Results demonstrate a relation between the location of veals calves with nuclear cataracts in the first trimester of gestation and the strength of antennas. The number of antennas within 100 to 199 meters was associated with oxidative stress and there was an association between oxidative stress and the distance to the nearest MPBS. Oxidative stress was increased in eyes with cataract (OR per kilometer: 0.80, confidence interval 95 % 0.62,0.93). It has not been shown that the antennas actually affected stress. Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics showed an accuracy of 100 % in negative cases with low radiation, and only 11.11 % accuracy in positive cases with high radiation. This reflects, that there are a lot of other possibilities for nuclear cataract beside MPBS. Further studies on the influence of electromagnetic fields during embryonic development animal or person at risk are indicated.","835":"","836":"","837":"","838":"Portable blood glucose meters (PBGMs) are useful in the management of diabetes mellitus in cats. In the present study we compared the performance of two PBGMs: the AlphaTRAK (Abbott Animal Health, Maidenhead, England) specifically developed for dogs and cats, and the Ascensia ELITE (Bayer HealthCare, Zurich, Switzerland) developed for humans. Quality parameters, including precision and accuracy, were better for the AlphaTRAK meter compared to Ascensia ELITE. While the AlphaTRAK meter results did not differ from the reference method, results from the Ascensia ELITE were significantly (P&lt;0.001) lower. The superior performance of the AlphaTRAK meter supports its use to monitor blood glucose levels in cats.","839":"In this case report a 10 year old Freiberger mare with a Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium infection is presented. This infection leads to a tuberculosis like disease with granulomatous alterations particularly of the intestines and lungs and is only sporadically reported in horses of Central Europe. Diarrhoea, mastitis and neck stiffness as well as dyspnoea and chronic cough are more specific symptoms of the infection, while weight loss, weakness and lethargy are nonspecific signs. As these clinical signs can occur in many other diseases, the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection is difficult and consists of rectum or distal colon biopsies and staining for acid-fast bacilli and bacteriological culture of granulomatous lesions. Classification of M. avium subsp. avium was achieved by PCR-RFLP. Even though an infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium is rare, it belongs to the differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases.","840":"An 8 year old male castrated Russian Blue cat with polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, abdominal enlargement, unkempt and easily epilated hair coat and abdominal alopecia is described. As a first step diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. Further work-up by ultrasonography revealed severe bilateral enlargement of the adrenal glands. Hypercortisolism was suspected and therefore ACTH stimulation test and dexamethasone suppression test were performed. In all samples cortisol concentrations were below the detection limit of the assay used. Various precursor hormones were measured and high progesterone concentrations were found. Histologically, the adrenal masses were characterised as bilateral adrenal carcinomas of the adrenal cortex. The case report demonstrates that adrenal gland tumors are also capable to secrete sex hormones instead of cortisol. Clinical signs of hyperprogesteronism are identical to those of hypercortisolism.","841":"The goal of the present study was to investigate whether protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) occurs in plasma samples of offspring of cows that developed bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; group A) and to compare the prevalence with that of a healthy control group in 2006 (Group B). Group A consisted of 181 offspring of cows that developed BSE and group B consisted of 240 healthy animals from a region in Switzerland where no cases of BSE occurred from 2001 to the end of 2006. All plasma samples were evaluated using Alicon PrioTrap, an antemortem test for PrPres. The time between birth of the offspring and onset of BSE in the dam was calculated to determine its relationship with the presence of PrPres in the plasma of the offspring. From 181 offspring, 29 (16.1%) had PrPres-positive plasma samples. Offspring that were born within one year of the onset of BSE in the dam had a significantly higher prevalence of PrPres-positive plasma samples than those born more than one year before the onset of BSE in the dam. Ten (4.2%) of 240 control cattle had PrPres-positive plasma samples. Thus, PrPres can be detected in bovine blood and occurs more frequently in the offspring of cows that develop BSE than in cattle of a healthy control population.","842":"Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated in pigs at slaughterhouse. The nasal cavities of 304 pigs from 54 herds were screened. Eighty-nine percent of the farms harbored pigs that were colonized with S. aureus. Among them, no MRSA were found, indicating a low prevalence. However, pigs were found to harbor S. aureus, which displayed resistance to penicillin (blaZ) (62.5%), tetracycline [tet(M)] (33.3%), streptomycin (strpS194) (27%), clindamycin [erm(B)] (4.1%), erythromycin [erm(B)] (4.1%), kanamycin (4.1%), chloramphenicol (catpC194) (2%) and gentamicin [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia] (2%). The S. aureus isolates mainly belong to Ridom spa type t034 (31.3%), t208 (14.6%) and t899 (12.5%). These pig-associated spa types have not yet been detected in hospitalized human patients in Switzerland. Surveillance programs are now necessary at both inland and import levels to rapidly detect and suppress the emergence of MRSA in pigs in Switzerland.","843":"","844":"","845":"","846":"The aim of this case report was to describe the clinical, ultrasonographic and postmortem findings in a goat with a mesothelioma. The most striking clinical sign was marked bilateral distension of the abdomen caused by ascites. Other signs included abnormal general condition, weight loss, hypothermia and increased heart rate. Ultrasonographic examination revealed accumulation of a massive amount of hypoechoic fluid in the abdominal cavity and nodular lesions on the peritoneum, omentum and wall of the omasum. Based on the clinical and ultrasonographic findings, a tentative diagnosis of ascites attributable to neoplasia was made, and the goat was euthanized. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis, and based on the results of histological examination, a mesothelioma was diagnosed.","847":"A 28-week-old sheep was presented at the animal hospital because of chronic emaciation, anemia and slight diarrhea. Due to poor general condition and bad prognosis the animal was euthanized and submitted for postmortem investigation. Multiple erosions and ulcerations were found in the dorsal region of the tongue, the pharynx, the hard palate, in the esophagus and the ruminal pillars. Histologically, these lesions consisted of necrosuppurative inflammation. The animal was tested positive for pestivirus antigen both by immunohistochemical and by virological examination (cell culture, antigen capture ELISA and RT-PCR). A non-cytopathic Border Disease Virus was identified, and sequencing revealed a virus belonging to the BDV-3 cluster. Based on the macroscopical, histological, immunohistological and virological results this case was diagnosed as Border Disease with mucosal lesions. This is the first report of such a case in Switzerland.","848":"Recent reports identified Tritrichomonas fetus, the causative agent of bovine trichomonosis, in cats with large-bowel diarrhea in the US. Between July 2007 and August 2008, a total of 105 Swiss cats were tested for T. fetus with the InPouchTM culture system and\/or PCR, whereof 27 (26%) yielded positive results. All positive cats were pedigree cats, whereof 22 (81%) were less than 1 year of age (median 5 months). 25 (93%) of these cats lived in multi-cat households, and all but one were kept indoor. The clinical picture was dominated by large bowel diarrhea with increased frequency of defecation and fresh blood and mucus. Furthermore, inflamed anus and fecal incontinence was common. 52% of the T. fetus-positive cats were tested positive for Giardia before, but the treatment with fenbendazole or metronidazole only temporarily alleviated the clinical signs. The treatment with 30 mg\/kg of ronidazole q12h p.o. was successful in all but 1 cat with only minor transient adverse effects in 3 cats. In conclusion, T. fetus has to be considered an important causative agent of large bowel diarrhea in cats in Switzerland, especially in young indoor pedigree cats.","849":"Necrotizing enteritis (NE) of newborn piglets still represents an economical problem in Swiss pig breeding and production. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for NE and evaluate the prevalence of C. perfringens with the toxingenes cpb and cpb2 in Swiss pig breeding farms. The prevalence of theses C. perfringens was investigated using fecal swabs followed by bacteriological culturing and genotyping. Close proximity to other breeding farms and large herd sizes were shown to predispose to NE. C. perfringens type C, carrying the genes cpa, cpb and cpb2 were frequently identified in herds with acute outbreaks of NE. Farms not affected by NE or those using prophylactic vaccination against NE were predominantly positive for C. perfringens type A strains with cpb2 and showed much lower prevalence of C. perfringens type C, compared to acutely affected herds. Our results demonstrate that C. perfringens type A strains with cpb2 are not associated with NE. Besides typical necropsy finding, only the identification of cpb can be used for the diagnosis of NE in affected herds.","850":"The re-emergence of necrotizing enteritis (NE) in Swiss pig breeding farms raised concern that, besides C. perfringens type C strains, additional C. perfringens toxinotypes might cause this disease. Therefore we retrospectively investigated the association of NE with C. perfringens type C or different C. perfringens toxinotypes. We evaluated pathological lesions, routine diagnostic bacteriology results, and multiplex real-time PCR analyses from DNA extracts of archived intestinal samples of 199 piglets from our diagnostic case load. 96.5% of NE cases and 100% of herds affected by NE were positive for C. perfringens type C genotypes. Animals without necrotizing enteritis revealed a significantly lower detection rate of type C genotypes. Non affected piglets showed a high prevalence for beta-2-toxin positive C. perfringens type A strains. Collectively, our data indicate that outbreaks of NE in piglets in Switzerland cannot be attributed to newly emerging pathogenic toxinotypes, but are due to a spread of pathogenic C. perfringens type C strains.","851":"","852":"","853":"The following case report describes the diagnosis and therapy of a cat with an Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection. The cat from the canton of St. Gallen was presented because of lethargy and lack of appetite. The clinical symptoms established were fever and minor exsiccosis. The diagnosis of granulocytic anaplasmosis was established through microscopic evidence of inclusion bodies in neutrophil granulocytes, the detection of pathogen DNA in the blood by PCR and positive IgM and IgG antibody titers by serological testing. Following this diagnosis the cat was treated for 20 days with doxycycline. As the body temperature normalised, the activity of the cat improved while normalisation of food intake was delayed. After therapy Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA could not be detected by PCR and a complete remission of abnormal serum chemistry and hematological parameters could be shown.","854":"This case report describes the clinical, sonographic, computed tomographic and pathological findings in a 9-year-old goat with mediastinal lymphocytic thymoma. The goat was referred to the Department of Farm Animals because of weight loss and dyspnoea. The lead clinical findings were increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate and heart sounds heard only on the right side. Ultrasonographic examination revealed a massive amount of fluid and an echogenic corrugated mass ventral to the lungs in the thoracic cavity on the left side. Computed tomography showed that the mass was very large and diffusely mineralised. A tentative diagnosis of mediastinal neoplasia was made, and the goat was euthanized. Postmortem examination revealed a cauliflower-like, pedunculated tumour, which occupied the entire left thoracic cavity and displaced the left lung. Based on histological evaluation, the tumour was diagnosed as a lymphocytic thymoma.","855":"Four hours after the consumption of raw goat milk, three Swiss children came down with emesis and diarrhea in July 2008. First investigations showed that the milk originated from a goat suffering from clinical mastitis (Staphylococcus aureus). In the milk sample from the untreated left udder, Staphylococcus aureus counts reached 5.0 x 10(7) CFU ml(-1). By PCR, the gene for the staphylococcal enterotoxin D was found in isolated strains. The consumption of raw milk is rarely associated with Staphylococcus aureus intoxications. Due to the flora naturally present in raw milk, Staphylococcus aureus normally cannot multiply sufficiently. However, in the present case, high Staphylococcus aureus counts were already present in the milk due to the mastitis of the goat. This amount sufficed to cause a Staphylococcus aureus intoxication in the children.","856":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is a nonfermentative bacterium, which is naturally resistant against a panel of commonly-used antibiotics. It is frequently isolated from humans with chronic respiratory disease, e.g. cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In veterinary medicine S. maltophilia is perceived to be a mere coloniser. We herewith report 7 strains of S. maltophilia isolated from animals, of which 5 strains were harvested from 3 horses, a dog and a cat with chronic respiratory disease. The dog isolate showed resistance to trimethoprim \/ sulphamethoxazole, which was confirmed by detection of the sul 1 gene. Analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that 2 horses, which were boarded in the same clinic but two years apart, harboured the same strain of S. maltophilia. This is indicative of a hospital acquired colonisation \/ infection, which contradicts involvement in the pre-existing chronic disease.","857":"For the first time in Switzerland, specifically trained livestock owners were included in a national disease surveillance program by the Federal Veterinary Office. A questionnaire on data about clinical and epidemiological aspects of Bluetongue Disease (BT) as well as on herd management was completed by 26 sheep owners three months after they had attended a training course about BT. The control group, consisted of 264 randomly selected sheep and cattle owners who had not visited a training course. Results showed that disease awareness for BT after attending the training course was considerably increased. This was especially evident in the better knowledge of the participants about the great number of possible symptoms. Training courses with the objective of increased disease awareness of livestock owners are an efficient, cost-effective instrument in control programs for exotic diseases.","858":"","859":"This case report describes the clinical, ultrasonographic and postmortem findings in an alpaca with Mycobacterium kansasii infection. The alpaca was referred because of chronic weight loss and weakness. The results of clinical examination, haematology and serum biochemistry were not diagnostic. Ultrasonography of the liver revealed multiple, hyperechogenic lesions with a diameter of 1 to 3 cm. Histological evaluation of a liver biopsy sample showed acute, multifocal, suppurative, necrotising hepatitis. Despite treatment with antibiotics, the alpaca died. Postmortem examination revealed nodular to coalescing lesions in the liver, lungs, mediastinum, pleura and greater omentum, which could not be differentiated macroscopically or histologically from lesions caused by tuberculosis. Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed massive numbers of rods within epithelioid macrophages, which were identified as Mycobacterium kansasii by polymerase chain reaction analysis.","860":"The clinical and laboratory findings in a 1-year-old male Jack Russel Terrier dog with lung worm induced coagulopathy are described. The diagnosis was based upon history, clinical findings, radiography, endoscopy, cytology and laboratory results. The presenting complaint was chronic cough. Radiographically, a diffuse interstitial to bronchial lung pattern was observed. Blood analysis revealed thrombocytopaenia and prolonged coagulation times. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) was diagnosed based on D-dimer and fibrinogen measurements, and by thrombelastogram results. After stabilisation of the patient, bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, where large amounts of lung worm larvae were found cytologically. After treatment with fresh frozen plasma and fenbendazole, coagulation parameters improved and the cough resolved.","861":"The aim of this study was to compare the results of invasive arterial blood pressure measurement using an electronic pressure transducer (EPT) or an aneroid pressure system (APS) in cattle. A catheter was placed in the auricular artery of 11 adult cattle and connected to a pressure transducer via pressure line. The aneroid system was connected to the same catheter using a three-way stop-cock in the pressure line. On five occasions three consecutive measurements were performed with the APS. The mean blood pressure values of the EPT were recorded before each individual measurement. Values from each device were compared using Passing and Bablok regression of agreement and a Bland and Altman difference plot. One hundred and forty-seven paired measurements were analysed. The average bias between the two methods (EPT vs. APS) was -1.6 mmHg (95 % confidence interval [CI]: -3.0 to -0.2 mmHg). The coefficient of correlation was 1.0084. The aneroid system showed an almost perfect agreement with the EPT. This study shows that it can be used in a clinical setting as well as under field conditions to measure arterial blood pressure in cattle.","862":"The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the etiology, frequency and outcome of toxicological cases recorded by the consultation service of the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre (STIC) hotline over a 10-year period, from 1997 to 2006. A detailed analysis of this database indicates that common human drugs not intended for use in animals, as well as pesticides and toxic plants represent the most prominent hazards involved in the reported cases of animal poisonings. The comparison with a previous survey from the years 1976 - 1985 revealed new toxic risks due to the accidental uptake of cannabis products, castor seeds or chocolate by dogs. In addition, there is a striking increase of serious poisonings with pyrethroids in cats. The follow-up reports delivered by veterinarians also reflect novel pharmacological and technological trends in the management of poisonings.","863":"","864":"In a 14 months old satin guinea pig Osteodystrophia fibrosa generalisata was diagnosed by clinical and x-ray examination. The guinea pig was treated palliatively with Meloxicam and Natriumrisedronate as well as periodic dental treatment. At the age of 3 years and 10 months the guinea pig died, but necropsy was denied by the owner.","865":"An 11-year-old, 75-kg, miniature pig was presented because of haemorrhagic vulvar discharge attributable to chronic endometritis. Ovariohysterectomy was carried out with the patient in dorsal recumbency and anaesthetised using total intavenous anaesthesia and positive-pressure ventilation. A ventral midline approach was chosen to remove the ovaries and uterus, which contained brown fluid and multifocal masses in the uterine wall. Histological examination of the uterine masses revealed leiomyoma, cystic hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. After surgery, the miniature pig recovered without complications and remained healthy at follow-up 4 months later.","866":"Creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are mainly muscle-specific enzymes, which can be associated with muscle tissue damage. The aim of this study was to assess the activities of CK and AST during the postoperative period, after conventional (G1) and videolaparoscopic ovariectomy (G2), in queens. A further group (G3) was subjected to anaesthesia only. Results demonstrate that there were significant differences between groups. The highest levels of CK were recorded in G1, however at a confidence level of p&lt;0.05 there was no significant difference between groups during the first 6 hours after surgery. A significant (p&lt;0.05) increase of CK values was identified between 0 h and 3 h in both groups (G1 and G2). Regarding AST activity there was no significant variation between groups, but again there was a significant difference between values at 0 h and 3h after surgery. In conclusion, ovariectomy performed by videolaparoscopy seems to cause less muscle damage when compared to the conventional method.","867":"The aim of this field study was to investigate the occurrence of biting midges (Culicoides spp.), the potential vectors of the bluetongue virus (BTV), in an alpine region of Switzerland (Vals\/GR) at altitudes between 1300 and 2000 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.). For this purpose, insects were caught with UV-light traps once weekly from the end of June to the end of October 2008. Midges were found on all altitudes investigated, but distinct differences in the abundance at different stations were noticed. Most midges were caught at the intermediate station (about 1500 m a.s.l.) whereas the catches on the two alps (approximately 2000 m a.s.l.) varied considerably. The predominance of midges belonging to the Pulicaris complex, whose vector competence regarding bluetongue virus (BTV) is largely unknown, rose with increasing altitude. To identify potential breeding habitats, 17 soil samples of three farms were incubated in the laboratory. Different insects emerged but none of them was a Culicoides spp. and, therefore, the habitats of juvenile stages remain unknown. From our results we can conclude that most likely there are no midges-free zones in all of the agriculturally utilized areas (including the alpine summer pastures) of Switzerland. This strongly indicates that cattle, sheep, goats and camelids which are permanently or temporarily kept in regions of higher altitude in Switzerland should be vaccinated against bluetongue.","868":"Midges of the genus Culicoides are the only known biological vectors of the bluetongue disease virus (BTV). Their occurrence at altitudes below 900 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) is monitored in Switzerland by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, to determine vector-free periods around winter. In this study, data about the number of midges caught at stations representing the 12 climatic regions of Switzerland are shown. The tiny midges of 1-3 mm in size were caught once per week with UV light traps and grouped under the stereomicroscope into Obsoletus complex, Pulicaris complex and other Culicoides spp. Midges were caught at all stations, albeit in very different numbers. The highest monthly average was 10,000 midges per night (Dittingen\/BL); the third highest average of all 12 stations was recorded for the highest-located station (Juf\/GR, 2130 m a.s.l.). At stations below 1500 m a.s.l., midges of the Obsoletus complex (98% in Dittingen), which in Central Europe are most likely considered to be responsible for the transmission of BTV, were predominant. With increasing altitude, midges of the Pulicaris complex prevailed (91% in Juf). Hence, there are no regions of the populated areas in Switzerland which are free of midges, but the vector competence regarding BTV of the various midges needs to be urgently clarified.","869":"","870":"The following case report describes the treatment of canker in a 14 years old warmblood gelding. The horse showed the typical appearance with caseous surface and early detachment of the superficial horn layers. The histological results show a severe degradation in the germinal layer of the epidermis of the frog. Surgical therapy under general anaesthesia was performed. On all limbs a tourniquet was applied and all abnormal tissue in the region of the frog and also the subdermal tissue underneath were removed. Postoperatively the horse was treated with hoof bandages for 2 weeks. Treatment plates were than applied on all hoofs. During the following weeks the wounds were topically treated with Giessner Mischung 2 an astringent, desinfectant powder. The powder contains jodophorm, zincoxyde, tanninic acid, metronidazole. After 5 months the frog showed a complete cover with strong horn material and without any signs of recrudescence.","871":"Since 1991, no cases of Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) have been reported in Switzerland. Risk factors for introduction of the virus into Switzerland are still present or have even increased as frequent inapparent infections, large numbers of imported horses, (since 2003) absence of compulsory testing prior to importation, EIA cases in surrounding Europe, possible illegal importation of horses, frequent short-term stays, poor knowledge of the disease among horse owners and even veterinarians. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of freedom from EIA in imported and domestic horses in Switzerland. The serum samples from 434 horses imported since 2003 as well as from 232 domestic horses fifteen years of age or older (since older horses have naturally had a longer time of being exposed to the risk of infection) were analysed using a commercially available ELISA test. All samples were seronegative, indicating that the maximum possible prevalence that could have been missed with this sample was 0.5% (95% confidence).","872":"Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) is a reportable, eradicable epizootic disease caused by the equine lentivirus of the retrovirus family which affects equids only and occurs worldwide. The virus is transmitted by blood, mainly by sanguivorous insects. The main symptoms of the disease are pyrexia, apathy, loss of body condition and weight, anemia, edema and petechia. However, infected horses can also be inapparent carriers without any overt signs. The disease is diagnosed by serological tests like the Coggins test and ELISA tests. Presently, Switzerland is offi cially free from EIA. However, Switzerland is permanently at risk of introducing the virus as cases of EIA have recently been reported in different European countries.","873":"Persons involved in equine breeding, namely veterinarians, horse breeders and breeding association judges, often lack of an apropriate consciousness about the relevance of heritability or supposed heritability of common horses diseases, which might play a distinctive role in the aetiology of numerous of these diseases. Executing animal welfare rights in equine breeding, the major concern should focus on an objective evaluation of pain, suffering and damages caused by different hereditary diseases. The basis of assessment for hygienic breeding has to be defi ned according to the actual animal welfare rights throughout guidelines, established by the state and by breeding associations. Hereditary diseases scientifi cally proven as relevant for animal welfare matters or including a potential risk of pain, suffering or damage, should be regarded as essential criterion in horse breeding. In this context following diseases have to be mentioned in particular: Osteochondritis dissecans, deep fl exor tendon contracture in the foal, navicular disease, tarsal osteoarthritis, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, Overo-lethal-white- foal-syndrome.","874":"","875":"","876":"This report describes the findings in five cows from one dairy herd, in which all 31 cows were slaughtered or euthanised because of traumatic reticuloperitonitis. All the cows had numerous thin sharp pieces of metal attached to a magnet in the reticulum, giving the magnet a hedgehog-like appearance. Investigation revealed that the cattle had eaten forage harvested from a field immediately adjacent to an airport. The snow was cleared from the airport runways with a machine that had a wire-bristle brush attachment. Mechanical wear resulted in numerous wire bristles breaking and these were blown with the snow onto the field in question. The wire then became accidentally incorporated into the hay and grass silage at harvest the next summer and was ingested by the cattle in the fall and winter. To prevent further cases, approximately 200 tonnes of hay and grass silage contaminated with wire were discarded and 30 hectares of the 50-hectare field were cultivated and re-sown. The wire-bristles of the snow plow were replaced with plastic bristles. The cost of this and the livestock loss was several hundred thousand Swiss Francs.","877":"Based on Directive (EC) No 99\/2003, monitoring programs on the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from livestock are implemented in many European countries. The aim of the present study was (i) to establish comprehensive baseline data on the antimicrobial resistance situation in Escherichia coli isolates obtained from healthy pigs (pooled fecal samples) originating from 60 Swiss pig-breeding farms, and (ii) to analyze differences in the resistance frequency between Escherichia coli isolates from weaned pigs and sows. Susceptibility testing (disc diffusion method) was performed on 429 isolates from weaned pigs and 431 isolates from sows. Overall, 17.7% of the isolates from weaned pigs and 22.5% of the Escherichia coli isolates from sows were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Low resistance prevalence was found for amoxicillin, amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefquinome, ciprofloxacin, colistin, florfenicol, and gentamicin. The most frequently found resistances were against streptomycin (60.6% of the isolates from weaners and 64.3% of the isolates from sows), sulfonamide (51.5% and 26.9%), tetracycline (35.2% and 22.0%), and trimethoprim (27.5% and 11.1%). With exception of colistin, most resistances were found for those antibiotics commonly used on the farms. Except for ciprofloxacin and streptomycin, isolates from weaned pigs showed higher resistance prevalence than those from sows. This difference was significant for cefquinome, florfenicol, sulfonamide, tetracycline, and trimethoprim (p&lt;0.05).","878":"The seroprevalence of pestivirus infections in small ruminants and new world camelids in Switzerland was determined. In 5'059 sera of sheep from 382 herds, 503 sera of goats from 54 herds and 109 sera of alpacas and lamas from 53 herds, population prevalences of 16.1% (sheep), 25.4% (goats) and 4.6% (new world camelids), respectively, were found. In order to determine the source of infection, the serological reactions were further characterized by cross-neutralization against two pestiviruses representing the genotypes BVDV (Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus)-1 and BDV (Border Disease Virus)-1. Based on the ratio of respective antibody titres, 56.1% of the infections in sheep were induced by a BDV-1, 12.9% by a BVDV-1 and 31.0% by an unresolved pestivirus. In goats, the corresponding proportions were 23.4%, 10.2% and 66.4%, respectively. In Alpacas and Lamas, the source of infection of 1 animal was BDV-1 and that of 4 seropositive animals remained unresolved. In view of the phylogenetic relationship between pestiviruses, the unresolved source of infection is most probably attributable to other pestivirus genotypes circulating in small ruminants and new world camelids. Due to the predominance of pestiviral genotypes other than BVDV-1, the risk of transmission of BVDV from persistently infected small ruminants and new world camelids to cattle appears to be moderate, apart from close direct contact in mixed animal husbandry, communal pasturing and grazing in the Alps.","879":"Bluetongue, caused by the bluetongue virus serotype 8 has rapidly spread through Europe since 2006. The first cases in Switzerland were detected in October 2007. The European Union and Switzerland launched a vaccination campaign in June 2008. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and the immune response of the three vaccines used in Switzerland under practical conditions in the field. The trial was carried out in cattle, sheep and goats. Based on the results of this study recommendations for the 2009 campaign are presented.","880":"","881":"","882":"","883":"","884":"A 5-year old, intact male Yorkshire Terrier was presented due to lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea. Clinical signs included shock, icterus and a painful abdomen. Laboratory examination revealed a severe intravascular hemolytic anemia, a thrombocytopenia and a leukocytosis. The radiographic examination revealed the presence of metallic foreign bodies in the stomach and in the intestine. After stabilisation of the patient with crystalloids, packed red blood cells, ranitidine, metamizole, amoxicilline\/clavulanic acid and marbofloxacine, surgery was performed and 5 coins (10 cent, 5 cent, 2 cent) were removed via esophagus and via enterotomy. In the course of disease the dog developed acute renal failure and pancreatitis. The zinc concentration in the serum was 2200 microg\/dl, which was 30 times higher compared to a healthy control dog. After 21 days the dog was discharged from the hospital. On day 28 all laboratory values were within the reference range.","885":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is defined as the presence of altered organ function in an acutely ill patient such that homeostasis could not be mantained without intervention. It is reported that mortality rate in humans with 4 organ systems failing reaches nearly 100%, while there are few publications documenting this syndrome in dogs. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report that describes the clinical manifestations and the favourable outcome to intensive medical care in a dog with Klebsiella pneumoniae septicemia and multiple organ dysfunction with 6 organ systems failing. Derangement of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, renal and coagulation system developed. This dog manifested reversible myocardial depression that is a common complication of sepsis in people but it is rarely reported in dogs.","886":"We report body weights (BW) and blood and serum analyses for 6 fully mature and 8 not-yet-mature captive plains viscachas before and 3, 6 and 9 months after switching from a low-fiber, high-energy diet to a high-fiber, low-energy diet. Initially, body weights, serum glucose, fructosamine and cholesterol levels were above the reference range in the fully mature animals. Furthermore, 4 of these animals had bilateral cataracts. After the diet change, these parameters dropped into the reference range. However, 9 months later, a slightly increased BW became evident again. The findings are consistent with a type II diabetes mellitus and underline the importance of dietary prevention.","887":"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an anti-GnRH vaccine on cycling activity in the adult ewe during the breeding season. For the experiments 22 cycling White Alpine sheep, aged between 2 and 4 years, were randomly divided into a treatment and control group of 11 animals, each. Sheep of the treatment group were immunized twice at an interval of 4 weeks with 2 ml (400microg GnRH-protein conjugate) of Improvac (Pfizer Animal Health, Australia) subcutanously in the neck. Sheep of the control group received the same amount of saline solution. Blood progesterone concentrations were measured weekly from 3 weeks before to 32 weeks after first immunization and anti-GnRH titers were determined monthly. All vaccinated ewes ceased cycling within 2 - 8 weeks after first immunization. Plasma progesterone was suppressed for a minimum of 12 weeks (2 ewes) with individual variation of 14 (1 ewe), 25 (1 ewe) and more than 25 weeks (7 ewes). Four animals resumed cyclicity while 7 animals remained suppressed until the end of the study. Antibody titers peaked one month after the booster injection and thereafter continuously dropped until the end of the study (8 months after first immunization) to values between 10.9 and 40.8 % binding. From our results it can be concluded that two vaccinations with Improvac 4 weeks apart suppress cycling activity in adult ewes for at least 12 weeks. The inhibitory effect on ovarian activity, however, varies individually and may last more than 31 weeks.","888":"","889":"","890":"","891":"","892":"The protozoon parasite Cryptosporidium parvum is an important cause of diarrhea in farm animals, but it can also infect other animals and humans. In this case report, oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. were microscopically detected by modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining in the feces of a 9 day old Arabian colt presented with yellowish, foul smelling, diarrhea and fever of 40 degrees C. PCR and sequencing of the isolate revealed C. parvum (bovine genotype). Hemato-chemical analysis of the foals blood revealed a marked hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG 108mg\/dl). The colt responded well to a supportive therapy and administration of plasma (until a gammaglobulin-concentration of 620 mg\/dl was reached) and was released in good health from the clinic after 10 days. Follow-up testing for Cryptosporidium oocycsts remained negative. Cryptosporidiosis with life-threatening diarrhea is a rare diagnosis in foals in Switzerland. Immunodeficiency increases the risk for cryptosporidiosis. We hypothesize that the low concentration of gammaglobulins together with the weak INF-gamma response normally observed in young foals may have favored the clinical manifestation with diarrhea. Foals with diarrhea should be screened for cryptosporidia with specific tests.","893":null,"894":"The Swiss BVD eradication campaign aims at eliminating the disease from the cattle population within a few years. During the initial phase from October 1st to December 31th 2008, all bovines will be individually tested and those found virus-positive slaughtered. In the following secondary phase, all newborn calves will be tested using ear notches taken on the occasion of the regular tagging process. From 2011 onwards, freedom of disease shall be confirmed based on a routine monitoring program, starting with antibody detection in milk of first lactating cows. In order to reduce the number of new infections, all bovines \"not yet calved\" and destined for shared mountain pastures were pretested in spring 2008. The more than enthusiastic start led to an extension of testing far beyond the targeted segment, resulting in almost 600'000 or more than one third of the population being tested until the end of June, 1.1% of which with a positive result. This overwhelming kick-off was extremely demanding for all parties involved, but also allowed identifying many limiting steps that could be optimized in view of the initial phase.","895":"A 14-year old Swiss warmblood gelding was presented to the equine hospital of the University of Zurich because of therapy-resistant fever. An intermittent lameness suggested the presence of an intravascular aorto-iliac thrombus which was confirmed sonographically. Subsequently, treatment was initiated with Heparin s.c. and continued for 7 months with Phenprocoumon (Marcoumar). The dosage was monitored and adjusted according to the prothrombin time, which was initially measured every week, and later maximally biweekly. The lameness improved and the regression of the thrombus could be followed sonographically. Seven months later the horse had to be euthanized due to acute colic.","896":"This case report describes the clinical findings, treatment and outcome of a four-year-old goat with type I diabetes mellitus. Weight loss, polydipsia and polyuria were the main clinical signs. Urinalysis revealed glucosuria, ketonuria and aciduria. The most important haematological and biochemical findings were anaemia attributable to parasitism, hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia. The goat was treated with insulin administered subcutaneously twice daily for almost four years. The goat developed bronchopneumonia at eight years of age and was euthanased. Postmortem examination showed degeneration of insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas.","897":"Postoperative anaesthesia recovery and analgesia qualities were compared in cats anaesthetised with racemic ketamine (RS-ket) or S-ketamine (S-ket) undergoing orchiectomy. Twenty client-owned male cats received medetomidine (0.03 mg\/kg) and S-ket (6 mg\/kg; n = 10) or RS-ket (10 mg\/kg; n = 10), all intramuscularly. After routine orchiectomy, animals received atipamezole (0.15 mg\/kg) intramuscularly. Thirty and 60 min after atipamezole administration, one observer unaware of the treatment identity evaluated analgesia using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and, by means of four points scales, sedation, unprovoked behaviour and behavioural reactions to external stimuli. Cats with a VAS &gt; or = 15 mm were to receive butorphanol. Times to sternal and standing positions were recorded. After 60 min, cats were given carprofen (4 mg\/kg) subcutaneously. Anaesthesia with S-ket, at 60% of the RS-ket dose, provided faster recoveries. At 60 min, undisturbed cats in S-ket group had a trend towards fewer behavioural changes. Cats in RS-ket group were more sedate at 30 min and responded with a lower intensity to external stimulation. Immediate postoperative analgesia was considered adequate for both groups and no cat required butorphanol administration.","898":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of semen handling by different inseminators on quality of frozen-thawed bovine semen. For this study a total of 10 ejaculates were collected from 7 bulls and semen stored frozen for 7 months in vessels of 10 inseminators each, in three different regions of Switzerland (A, B and C). After storage motility and acrosome integrity (live spermatozoa with intact acrosomes) were measured in frozen-thawed semen by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and flowcytometry, respectively. In addition, the 56 days non-return rate (NRR) was determined for each inseminator and the relation between NRR of single inseminators and semen quality examined. Results demonstrate that motility as well as acrosome integrity of stored frozen semen were significantly influenced by the specific delivery system used in the different regions and by the ejaculate. After storage of straws in region B semen motility was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than in region C. In region B the percentage live and acrosome intact spermatozoa as well as the NRR of the inseminators were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than in region A. Motility and acrosome integrity of semen stored by single inseminators were significantly correlated with the inseminator's NRR. We conclude that the quality of frozen semen clearly varied between inseminators of the three regions with an impact on NRR.","899":"Primary (extranodal) malignant lymphoma limited exclusively to the urinary bladder is an extremely rare disorder in both humans and animals and has to be differentiated from malignant lymphoma cases where a systemic (multicentric) lymphoma has spread to the bladder. We report a case of a 3-year old female spayed mixed breed dog presenting with gross haematuria and dysuria and diagnosed with a primary B-cell high-grade lymphoma of the urinary bladder without involvement of any other site. After treatment with a combination of hypofractionated external beam radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy, rapid and complete remission of the tumor occurred. At present the dog is alive and has been in remission for 52 months.","900":"A 20-year-old cow was presented due to chronic diarrhea and weight loss. The clinical examination revealed a markedly enlarged left ovary. However, a cause of the diarrhea could not observe. The examination of the feces was negative for a parasites or bacteria causing diarrhea. The results of hematological and biochemical analyses revealed a mild leucocytosis, bilirubinaemia, higher activities of the enzymes aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and creatine kinase. The plasma concentrations of estrogen and testosterone were below the detection limits, progesterone concentration was 2.7 ng\/ml. The postmortem examination revealed a bile ductule carcinoma with metastases in the lung and in lung and mestenterial lymph nodes. The cause of the tumor remained unclear. Diarrhea might have been the consequence of a portal hypertension due to the tumor. The pathological examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis of the ovarian tumor. The genesis of the ovarian tumor may be independent of the genesis of the bile ductule carcinoma.","901":"The clinical findings and treatment of 3 calves with bleeding attributable to severe thrombocytopenia (1000 to 5000 platelets\/microl) are described. The calves responded to treatment with whole blood transfusion, dexamethasone and other drugs. One calf was subsequently diagnosed with persistent bovine viral diarrhoea virus infection and was euthanased despite a favourable response to treatment. The other two calves were discharged after platelet counts had normalised and bleeding had stopped.","902":"Swiss Bluetongue surveillance from mid 2007 to mid 2008 was a combination of monthly bulk milk testing of 200 cattle herds in zones of higher risk for vector presence and intensification of passive clinical surveillance. The spatial scan statistic and Moran's I statistic were used to determine clustering of surveillance data. The results show a high level of surveillance intensity for BT in Switzerland in 2007. In the region encompassing the Cantons of Aargau, Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt and Solothurn, where cases were detected in 2007, the surveillance was significantly higher than in the rest of Switzerland. Six cases of Bluetongue were detected within the surveillance system. The prevalence estimates 9.62% (95% CI = 3.25%-18.85% versus 0.98% (95% CI = 0.2%-2.22%) were also significantly higher in the area with higher surveillance intensity. Spatial variation in surveillance data should to be considered if a disease event is analysed on a national scale. The spatial variation of prevalence estimates should be considered in future Bluetongue surveillance in Switzerland.","903":"","904":"","905":"","906":null,"907":"The contribution deals with legal structure, organization and problems of application of the Swiss animal welfare legislation of 1978. Besides positive effects considerable problems with the application of the legislation occurred, in particular in housing of bovines, swine and laying hens. Punishable acts of animal protection in companion and pet animals were markedly increasing in the last years, particularly in dogs. There were also loopholes in the legislation, which could be filled by the new animal welfare law of 2005 and the animal welfare ordinance of 2008 with only a few exceptions.","908":"The contribution deals with history and effects of the Swiss animal welfare legislation of 1978. Special descriptions concern the development and increasing dissemination of animal friendly housing systems for cattle, swine, rabbits and poultry, the realization of the prohibition of the usual cages for laying hens until the end of 1991 and the development of aviary systems, the examination and improvement of many housing systems and equipment for farm animals, adaptations of many enclosures for wild animals in zoos and circuses, improvements in animal experimentation and also in housing of companion animals. The new animal welfare law of 2005 and the animal welfare ordinance of 2008 filled loopholes in the legislation. Animal friendly housing forms may also have economic advantages.","909":"An 8 years old male persian cat with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was scheduled for transternal thoracotomy. An anterior mediastinal mass, suspected to be a thymoma, had to be resected. Progressive paraparesis and reduced ocular reflexes and menace response were the main clinical features. At the preoperative examination the cat appeared free of significant myocardial or respiratory diseases. The possibility of compromised respiratory function due to muscle weakness was addressed by the choice of a balanced anesthesia protocol without the use of muscle-relaxants. Intravenous induction was followed by intubation, administration of isoflurane in oxygen and ventilatory support. Thorough cardiorespiratory monitoring was performed during anaesthesia. Epidural morphin was given to reduce the amount of inhalation agent required to maintain anaesthesia and supplemental intravenous analgesia was given. At the end of the surgery, intrapleural bupivacaine was administered to help controlling poststernotomy pain, while reducing the need for systemic analgesics. Although rapid returning of swallowing reflex and spontaneous breathing followed the disconnection from the anaesthetic circuit, the cat needed to breath oxygen enriched air to maintain a normal hemoglobin saturation in the early postoperative phase.","910":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate if pre-anaesthetic thoracic radiographs contribute to the anaesthetic management of trauma patients by comparing American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (ASA grade) with and without information from thoracic radiography findings. Case records of 157 dogs and cats being anaesthetized with or without post-traumatic, pre-anaesthetic chest radiographs were retrospectively evaluated for clinical parameters, radiographic abnormalities and anaesthetic protocol. Animals were retrospectively assigned an ASA grade. ASA grades, clinical signs of respiratory abnormalities and anaesthesia protocols were compared between animals with and without chest radiographs. The group of animals without pre-anaesthetic radiographs was anaesthetized earlier after trauma and showed less respiratory abnormalities at presentation. The retrospectively evaluated ASA grade significantly increased with the information from thoracic radiography. Animals with a higher ASA grade were less frequently mechanically ventilated. Pre-anaesthetic radiographs may provide important information to assess the ASA grade in traumatized patients and may therefore influence the anesthesia protocol.","911":"Since 2003, the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) is realizing a herd health management programme (\"pro-Q\" project) focussing on udder health. The objectives of the project are: (1) to reduce antibiotic mastitis treatments, (2) to optimise udder health and (3) to improve longevity, measured as averaged number of herd lactations. The farms get expert advice in prevention and treatment on herd- and animal-level. After 2 years, treatment recordings of the 65 investigated farms showed that antibiotic mastitis therapies were reduced from 38 to 26 treatments per 100 cows and year (equals a reduction of 32%). Lactation numbers of the herds increased significantly by 0.2 lactations from 3.3 to 3.5 lactations per cow. Udder health remained constant over all farms during 2 years: theoretical bulk milk cell counts averaged constantly at around 180000 cells\/ml. Improvement of udder health on farm level was significantly influenced by higher somatic cell count when the project started and enhanced by farmer's motivation and farm-veterinarians' commitment to the project.","912":"Clinical disease of bluetongue (BT) in sheep may differ depending on breed, age and immunity of infected sheep and may also vary between serotype and strain of BT virus (BTV). Since there are no data available on the susceptibility of Swiss sheep breeds for BT, we performed experimental infection of the 4 most common Swiss sheep breeds and the highly susceptible Poll Dorset sheep with the BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) circulating in Northern Europe since 2006. Clinical signs were assessed regarding severity, localisation, progression and time point of their appearance. The results clearly show that the Swiss sheep breeds investigated were susceptible to BTV-8 infection. They developed moderate, BT-characteristic symptoms, which were similar to those observed in Poll Dorset sheep. Regardless of breed, the majority of infected animals showed fever, swelling of the head as well as erosions of the mouth and subcutaneous haemorrhages.","913":"","914":"","915":"","916":"This case report describes the findings in a seven-month-old heifer with diabetes insipidus attributable to internal hydrocephalus. The heifer was referred to the clinic because of reduced appetite, polydipsia, decreased faecal output and weight loss. The heifer was examined daily for 8 days. She was thin and weak and had a dull dry hair coat and decreased appetite. The heifer urinated frequently; the urine was clear and yel low, had a specific gravity of 1.015. A complete blood cell count, biochemical profile and blood gas analysis revealed increased serum urea, increased serum creatinine, hypernatraemia, hyperchloraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypophosphataemia. The heifer received 10 litres of water and 3 litres of ruminal fluid from a healthy cow per os daily for 5 days. The heifer had access to fresh water ad libitum. The general condition of the heifer did not improve after this treatment. Although the concentration of serum urea and creatinine decreased, the concentrations of sodium, chloride and calcium remained higher than normal. Based on the findings, a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was made and the heifer was euthanatized. Postmortem examination revealed severe internal hydrocephalus, and a definitive diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus attributable to internal hydrocephalus was made.","917":"Through a written questionnaire, which was sent to a representatively distributed and randomly selected sample of Swiss horse owners, data of 2912 horses and ponies were acquired to extrapolate prevalence data of health disorders. General questions about the horse and associated factors of housing and use, as well as questions about the current health status and the occurrence of diseases and injuries had been asked. 718 horses (24.7% of the sample) had been examined by a veterinarian within the 12 months prior to the survey. Orthopaedic and traumatic disorders (41.5%) had the largest proportion, followed by gastrointestinal--(27.1%) and respiratory (14.0%) diseases. Half of the lameness cases occurred as a direct consequence of a injury. The injuries were associated with pasture\/paddock (38.1%), kicking and biting (21.6%), boxstall (7.8%), terrain and hacking (13.4%), training (3.5%), competition (3.5%), transportation (3.0%) or other circumstances (9.1%). A change in feeding management up to 4 weeks before development of a colic episode occurred in 26.5% of all colic cases. In 13.8% of all respiratory cases the same disease was diagnosed in other horses in the same barn. 8.1% of all cases had to be treated surgically, 6.7% required hospitalization for several days. Information about diagnostic or therapeutic procedures was related to specific disease categories. In 25.6% of all cases diagnosed by a veterinarian alternative therapeutic methods were used either in addition to traditional medicine or exclusively.","918":"A survey of 2559 stables, representative for Switzerland, was conducted in the year 2004, with questions related to age, sex, breed, housing conditions, social contact, use, feeding, ability to move freely on the one hand, and health prophylaxis and health disorders in the past 12 months on the other. With a respond rate of 30.9% to the questionnaire, data for 2912 horses and ponies were recorded. The data were compared to a previous survey of 1997 (Bachmann &amp; Stauffacher, 2002). In this study, data on population, housing and use were analysed. The proportion of horses kept individually, especially in tie-stalls, had substantially decreased since 1997, whereas the proportion of horses living in group housing systems had increased. In 2004, Warmblood and Thoroughbred were kept more often individually than in groups in comparison to other breeds. Swiss Franches-Montagnes horses were kept more often tied up than horses of all other breeds. Access to pasture or paddock was available more often in horses kept in structured group housing systems, but in general more restricted in the winter season. A correlation between use or intensity of use and frequency of pasture\/paddock access was not evident. Even though horses older than 20 years were more rarely used or intensively used, they were not stabled differently from younger horses.","919":"","920":"","921":"","922":"","923":"This case report describes the findings in a 10-year-old goat with metastasis of an adenocarcinoma in the iris. Two weeks before admission, the owner had noticed blepharospasm of the left eye. Clinical examination by the referring veterinarian revealed unilateral intraocular hemorrhage. The goat was referred to our clinic for further work-up. The rectal temperature was 40 degrees C. The most important haematological result was severe thrombocytopenia. There was mild corneal oedema of the left eye. Approximately 75 per cent of the anterior chamber was filled with non-coagulated blood. The fluid in the anterior chamber dorsal to the blood was cloudy, and the corpora nigra could not be seen clearly. All other internal parts of the eye could not be seen. Ultrasonography of the left eye confirmed cloudiness of the anterior chamber and revealed moderate thickening of the iris. The right prescapular lymph node was markedly enlarged. Cytological examination of a fine needle aspirate of the lymph node showed a mixed population of neoplastic cells. Based on immunohistochemical evaluation of the cells metastasis of a carcinoma was diagnosed. The goat was subjected to euthanasia, and a postmortem examination was carried out. The anterior chamber of the left eye contained blood, and the iris was thicker than normal and adhered to the posterior surface of the cornea. There were neoplastic alterations in the iris, the oesophagus, the lung lobes, the liver, the kidney and in the prescapular, retropharyngeal, mediastinal and hepatic lymph nodes. Histologically, a diagnosis of carcinoma was confirmed, but the origin of the tumour could not be determined.","924":"A 15 year old Oldenburger gelding was treated during 3 weeks for laminitis with the anticoagulant phenprocoumone (27 mg orally, once daily) and concurrent administration of phenylbutazone (2-4 g orally, twice daily). After this treatment the animal was presented to the Equine Clinic University of Zurich with a history of acute colic and advanced symptoms of shock. On the basis of the clinical signs and laboratory values, a diagnosis of combined drug induced coagulopathy was made. The horse was treated with the antidote Vitamine-K1 (0.5 mg\/kg, subcutaneously). Eventually, the general condition of the animal worsened and it was therefore euthanized. Necropsy revealed profound, multifocal hemorrhagic diathesis of the serosal surface of the viscera, as well as bleeding into the visceral cavities. This case shows that concurrent administration of phenprocoumone and phenylbutazone may lead to drug interactions that increase the anticoagulation effect of the coumarine-derivative. Simultaneous use of coumarine-derivatives and phenylbutazone is therefore contraindicated due to the higher risk of bleeding. A reasonable treatment of horses with anticoagulants requires regular monitoring with constant evaluation of coagulation status and special attention to potential drug interactions.","925":"This study investigates the situation regarding housing of small animals in Swiss pet shops. Data of 92 pet shops were collected with a questionnaire. On average 813 fish, 52.5 invertebrates, 32.2 small mammals, 26.9 birds, 8.9 reptiles and 2.7 amphibians were offered for sale per pet shop. Small mammals, birds and reptiles were mainly obtained from Swiss breeders, while fish and amphibians were almost exclusively purchased from foreign providers. The housing systems which were sold differed from those in which the animals were kept in the shop. This may be misleading to the future pet owners and may lead to faulty husbandry. Animals on reserve were often kept in different housing systems than those in the pet shop. Sick animals were usually treated or killed by the pet shop owners. The killing methods varied between the various species.","926":"Methicillin resistance has emerged in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from cats in Switzerland. Three cats suffering from urinary tract infections were infected with methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP). Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the resistance profile showed that the isolates displayed resistance to all beta-lactams and cephalosporins (blaZ, mecA), fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines [tet(K)], macrolides, lincosamides and streprogramins B [erm(B)], chloramphenicol (catpC221), trimethoprim [dfr(G)] and the aminoglycosides gentamicin [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia], kanamycin and neomycin [aph(3')-III] and streptomycin [ant(6)-Ia]. They also harbor the leukocidin gene lukS-I. MRSP represents a new challenge for antibiotic therapy and this zoonotic bacteria may rapidly spread to animals and humans.","927":"The goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy of calcium chloride, sodium phosphate or a combination of these two substances administered orally immediately postpartum for the prevention of parturient paresis in cows. Thirty-two cows that had had parturient paresis at the previous calving, and in which serum biochemistry had shown hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia, were used in the study. The cows were transferred to the Department of Farm Animals, University of Zurich, five days before their expected due dates. On a randomized trial, the cows were given calcium chloride, sodium phosphate, both substances or no treatment (controls) via a stomach tube immediately postpartum and 12 hours later. The cows were monitored for 96 hours during which time blood was collected on a regular basis for the determination of total calcium, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium concentrations. Of the 32 cows treated, 19 (59%) had parturient paresis and 13 (41%) did not. The incidence of parturient paresis did not differ significantly among the groups although there was a tendency for a lower incidence in cows treated with both calcium chloride and sodium phosphate. The various treatments had no apparent effect on serum calcium concentration. The concentration of inorganic phosphorus increased significantly in cows treated with sodium phosphate compared with the controls. The results of this study showed that cows treated with both calcium chloride and sodium phosphate orally tended to have a lower incidence of parturient paresis. Further investigation into multiple administrations of oral calcium chloride and sodium phosphate, started before parturition, for the prevention of parturient paresis is required.","928":"In a herd of dairy sheep several losses occurred due to a respiratory syndrome in combination with progressive wasting. Clinical and pathomorphological diagnostics of 3 sheep revealed the presence of cancerous masses in the nasal cavities. These neoplasms were identified as adenocarcinomas originating from the nasal mucosa. Etiologically, they were attributed to JRSV (Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus) by detection of capsid protein 24 in western blot. The significance of the disease in Switzerland is discussed, also in the context of lung adenomatosis.","929":"Sheep and goat husbandry has always played an important role in swiss agriculture, but in recent years these animals are increasingly appreciated as hobby pets. This opens new diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives for veterinary surgeons, notably in the determination of hematological and clinical biochemical parameters. For the current methods used there are no reference range values available for adult sheep and goats kept under swiss conditions. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine haematological and clinical biochemical parameters in 102 goats and 102 sheep from swiss flocks. Significant differences were found between the two species, especially regarding erythrocyte count, mean erythrocyte volume, hemoglobin content as well as leukocyte count. It is therefore of utmost importance to discriminate between sheep and goats when interpreting laboratory tween findings.","930":"The goal of the present study was to describe the ultrasonographic findings in 22 cattle with traumatic pericarditis. A 5.0 MHz linear transducer or a 5.0 MHz convex transducer was used to examine the thorax, reticulum and liver. There was severe pleural effusion in 17 heifers and severe pericardial effusion in 13 animals. Echogenic deposits and strands of fibrin were seen on the epicardium of 7 animals. Eighteen cattle had signs of traumatic reticuloperitonitis, and 11 had ascites. Because of cardiac insufficiency, 14 cattle had a markedly enlarged liver due to congestion and 15 had dilatation of the caudal vena cava. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic aid for visualisation and characterisation of thoracic and abdominal lesions in cattle with traumatic pericarditis.","931":"Neospora caninum is widely recognized as one of the most important abortifacients in cattle and causes substantial financial losses to bovine livestock production. This study aimed to calculate the losses caused by N. caninum on Swiss dairy farms and to evaluate the efficacy and profitability of the control strategies culling, not breeding replacements and chemotherapy of calves on farm level. Three different farm sizes with high, medium and low herd prevalences were defined. Epidemiological and financial models were used to simulate the effect of control strategies on the prevalence over time and to perform a cost-benefit analysis. The median annual losses on farm level ranged between CHF 3094.- (= Euro 1875; 60 dairy cattle, high prevalence) and CHF 134.- (= Euro 81; 15 dairy cattle, low prevalence). Culling of animals that had any abortion or a N. caninum abortion, or not breeding replacements from such animals, respectively, were neither effective nor profitable. Only the strategy \"not breeding replacements from N. caninum seropositive cows\" on farms with a high prevalence was financially attractive. The strategy \"chemotherapy of calves\" should be re-evaluated as soon as new data regarding the efficacy of treatment and a corresponding protocol have been scientifically validated.","932":"The aim of this paper was to examine the effect of eliminating persistently infected (PI) animals on BVDV infection during transhumance and to identify possible weak points in the prevention of new infection. An initial blood sample (A) was taken from all the animals until one week before the date of trans-humance (n = 190) and examined for virus by means of real-time RT-PCR or antigen-ELISA and for antibodies by means of ELISA. One PI animal was identified and eliminated. On the day of transhumance (B), serology was performed of the blood samples of all animals that had had a negative or unknown antibody status (n = 93) when blood sample A had been examined. At the end of the transhumance season (C) those animals that had tested seronegative in sample B were re-examined for antibodies (n = 65). The case incidence per animal year amounted to 37.1% up to sample A, 41.8% between sample A and sample B (4 seroconversions). Four cases of seroconversion were diagnosed during the transhumance season, which equalled a case incidence of 17.8% per animal year. A season of transhumance free of PI animals failed to completely prevent BVDV infection, but the new infection rate was significantly diminished. The most possible explanation for new infections are abortions of PI-animals.","933":"","934":"The study deals with the situation regarding housing of dogs and cats in Swiss shelters and kennels. In shelters, dogs were mainly held inside a cubicle with a small outside yard. In kennels, housing of dogs took place mainly in inside rooms. Usually two or three dogs were kept together. Cats were held in rooms, with or without outside yards, mainly in groups; no establishment preferred exclusively the housing in cubicles. Shelters received on average 183 dogs and 262 cats each year. Among them, about a third were lost animals while the remaining ones were relinquished. The study highlights some possibilities for improvements and the great diversity of the establishments regarding their size, infrastructure, housing conditions and aims.","935":"In a review based on literature searches animal welfare related characteristics in extreme breed types of small mammals, ornamental birds, reptiles and ornamental fish are summarized.

Efforts are important in particular by breeding organisations to adapt breeding standards and to improve the education of judges and breeders. Furthermore adequate activities to correctly inform animal keepers are important.","939":"Many of the important diseases of sport and pleasure horses are thought to have a genetic component. The majority of these diseases, however, are multifactorial and are influenced not only by genetics, but also by environmental factors. In this review some of the most important multifactorial diseases are described and the current evidence for a genetic background is discussed.","940":"Overall, monogenetic hereditary diseases are less important for the breeding industry than polygenetic diseases because they are relatively rare. For the individual animal, however, these diseases have often a dramatic outcome and many of these diseases presently known are lethal. For several of them the exact pathogenesis is known and DNA-tests are available to confirm the exact diagnosis.","941":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the spermatogenic and Leydig cell activity in stallions with impaired semen quality after treatment with equine somatotropin. Experiments were performed using 18 adult clinically healthy stallions with poor semen quality which did not pass breeding soundness evaluation. The animals were randomly divided into a treatment (n = 9) and a control (n = 9) group. Over a period of 90 days, nine stallions received a daily intramuscular injection of 10 mg recombinant equine somatotropin (EquiGen, BresaGen Limited, Adelaide, Australia) and 9 control animals were injected with the same amount of physiological saline solution. During and until 2 months after treatment, semen characteristics and daily sperm output as well as plasma testosterone concentrations were determined monthly in all stallions. In addition, testosterone concentration measurement after stimulation with hCG was performed in all animals immediately before and at the end of the treatment period as well as 2 months later. Our results demonstrate that equine somatotropin (EquiGen) given daily in a dose of 10 mg per animal during 90 days had no significant effect neither on plasma testosterone concentrations and hCG-induced testosterone release nor on semen quality parameters in adult stallions with poor semen characteristics.","942":"","943":"","944":"","945":"A 13-year-old, female neutered, domestic shorthair indoor cat was referred to our hospital for treatment of multiple meningiomas. A slight generalized ataxia was seen, proprioception was severely decreased on all four limbs, and menace reaction was bilaterally reduced. Pre- and postoperatively MRI examination were performed. Three supratentorial extra-axial lesions were imaged. The fourth mass was localized infratentorial extra-axial overlying the left cerebellar hemisphere. The caudoventral cerebellum had herniated caudally, approximately one cm through the foramen magnum. Cervical syringohydromyelia was found as coincidental finding. Multiple craniotomies, centered over the meningiomas were performed. Postoperative outcome two years after the surgery is excellent. The authors also reviewed the veterinary and human literature about intracranial tumors associated syringohydromyelia. Generally, the treatment of syringohydromyelia should be targeted at the pathological process, which causes the obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid flow, and leads to syringohydromyelia formation.","946":"The aim of this study was to compare the results of an intradermal skin test (IDST) with those of an allergen-specific IgE-ELISA in 210 dogs with atopic dermatitis. All the dogs had a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and underwent an IDST. The sera of all dogs were analysed for allergen-specific IgE by ELISA using the monoclonal antibody D9 against dog IgE. IDST was used as the standard assay. In both methods, the following antigens provided a positive test result: Dermatophagoides farinae, Acarus siro, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, ragweed, mugwort and Lepidoglyphus destructor. ELISA had an overall sensitivity of 82.4% and an overall specificity of 93.8%. The overall accuracy of the ELISA was 91.3%. The evaluated monoclonal D9 ELISA was found to be a reliable tool for the diagnosis of those allergens that cause clinical atopy, and can be recommended for use in dogs when immunotherapy is a therapeutic option.","947":"The objective of this study was to investigate how well cows drink the Propeller calcium drink, and it's effect on blood calcium concentration. Drinking was tested in 120 cows right after calving, before cows drank anything else. 60 cows each were offered 20 liters of Propeller calcium drink or 20 liters of water. Cows drank the Propeller as good as water. 72% of all cows drank all 20 liters, 18% drank on average 8.2 liters and 10% drank less than 1 liter. Blood calcium concentration was studied in 16 cows right after calving. Eight cows each were offered 20 liters of Propeller calcium drink or no calcium drink. Blood calcium significantly increased ten minutes after Propeller intake and stayed significantly elevated for 24 hours. Without calcium drink blood calcium levels decreased significantly. Advantages of the new Propeller calcium drink over calcium gels or boli could be that cows now drink calcium themselves and that the Propeller increases blood calcium concentration rapidly and long lasting.","948":"At the end of the national eradication program for Enzootic Pneumonia (EP) and Porcine Actinobacillosis (APP) in Switzerland (2003), A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 is considered to have been eradicated. There is no current information about the distribution of the other serotypes available. The ApxIV ELISA detects antibodies against all serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae, without cross-reaction with other bacterial species. The aim of this study was to achieve actual data concerning the seroprevalence of A. pleuropneumoniae in breeding-herds and to validate the ApxIV ELISA under field conditions, especially for the diagnosis of latently infected breeding-herds without clinical signs, and to achieve more information about the role of herd book farms for the spread of the infectious agent. A total of 2068 serum samples from 96 pig herds in Switzerland were examinated. Over half of the examinated herd book farms showed positive results in this ELISA. 93% of the breeding herds were positive. On single animal level sensitivity was 96% and specifity 100%. Herd sensitivity ranged between 67% and 99%. Herd specifity was 100%. The results show that the ApxIV ELISA is a valuable tool for the detection of latently infected herds.","949":"","950":"We report the use of a balanced anesthetic technique in a three-year-old, female Huacaya alpaca with an increased anesthetic risk that underwent an extensive dental surgery. Anesthesia was provided with an infusion of midazolam, fentanyl, S-ketamine and low concentrations of isoflurane in oxygen. The mandibular alveolar nerve was desensitized with a lidocaine-bupivacaine combination. The alpaca showed signs of hypoxemia fifteen minutes after anesthesia induction and arterial blood gases confirmed severe venous admixture. Application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6-9 cm H2O improved the arterial oxygenation. Other cardiopulmonary variables remained within the normal range. At the end of surgery, sarmazenil was administered to antagonize the effects of midazolam and emergence from anesthesia was smooth and uneventful. Flunixine meglumine and a transdermal delivery system for fentanyl were administered for post-operative analgesia. This method of balanced anesthesia allowed for an adequate anesthetic plane and a safe recovery, however, special ventilation strategies (PEEP) had to be applied.","951":"Ten miniature breed dogs with atlantoaxial subluxation underwent ventral lag screw stabilisation. The procedure did not include bone graft packing into the atlantoaxial articulation. Four dogs showed continuous improvement after surgery. Three dogs developed complications due to external trauma and postoperative implant failure but improved with conservative therapy. Three patients died or were euthanized in early perioperative or postoperative period. The long-term outcome was good or favourable in all surviving patients. Suspected fibrous tissue proliferation and stabilisation without permanent bone fusion was found to be clinically satisfactory when the atlantoaxial joint has been subjected to limited stress during a long-term monitoring period.","952":"The effects of three dietary selenium (Se) levels (0.15, 0.35 and 0.5 mg\/kg dry matter (dm) and of two Se-compounds (sodium selenite and Se-yeast) on the Se-status, liver function and claw health were studied using 36 fattening bulls in a two-factorial feeding trial that lasted 16 weeks. The claw health was assessed macroscopically and microscopically. Compared to the two control diets containing 0.15 mg Se\/kg dm, the intake of the diets containing 0.35 and 0.50 mg Se\/kg dm significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased the Se-concentration in serum, hair, liver and skeletal muscle. Compared to sodium selenite the intake of Se-yeast resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher Se-concentration in serum, liver and hair. Concerning the claw horn quality, there was no significant difference between the different groups; the animals receiving organic Se tended to have a better histological score (P = 0.06) at the coronary band than the groups fed with sodium selenite. The serum vitamin E level decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing Se-intake, which had no influence (P &gt; 0.1) on growth and liver function parameters. With the exception of the decrease of the serum vitamin E level indicating an oxidative stress caused by a high Se-intake, no negative effects of dietary selenium exceeding recommended levels for 4 months were observed.","953":"Since 2006 bluetongue disease is rapidly spreading across Europe and reached Switzerland in October 2007.

Left grade 4 laryngeal hemiplegia was diagnosed via laryngoscopy, whereas the severity of the hemiplegia was assessed according to the grading system used in horses. The results of clinical, radiographic, sonographic and endoscopic examinations as well as haematological, biochemical and serological analyses did not reveal the cause of the hemiplegia. Treatment with an antibiotic and vitamin B complex resulted in only slight improvement. A postmortem examination four months later revealed no gross lesions in the left laryngeal nerve, larynx and intrinsic laryngeal musculature. Histological examination of the nerve, arytenoid cartilage and intrinsic laryngeal musculature also showed no lesions. Therefore, the cause of the disease in this goat is suspected to be on the cellular or molecular level of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature.","963":"One of the essential tasks of veterinary pathology is the gross and microscopic examination of animals post mortem. Frequently requests are made for the cause of disease or death in the absence of a precise history or an otherwise specific assignment e.g. whether a notifiable disease is involved. The general examination is supplemented by a spectrum of additional examinations depending on the case whereas attempts are made to keep the costs within limits and to answer the client's request with justifiable effort. 36,365 necropsy cases and 9192 organs submitted between 1988 and 2004 were analysed to give indications on the number and type of notifiable diseases that were diagnosed in the course of routine diagnostic procedures. Notifiable animal diseases were discovered in 2918 cases (6.4% of all investigated cases) namely 2426 farm animals (9.1% of all farm animals) and 492 animals of other species (2.6% of all other animal species). These data illustrate the considerable value of pathological-anatomical examinations and compliment the figures from other databases.","964":"Carbofurane, a pesticide from the group of carbamates, has been employed against soil nematodes on a small meadow at the lake of Lugano, Switzerland. On the next morning, the first cases of death involving a total of 19 mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) have been reported. By inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetycholine, carbamates lead to excessive activation of the parasympathicus. In addition, paralysis of skeletal muscles is caused by continued stimulation of neuromuscular junctions. Death may occur by asphyxia. In the present case report, the diagnosis of poisoning could be confirmed by the chemical detection of carbofuran in the stomach, blood, muscle and kidney tissue of the affected mallard ducks.","965":"The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a part of the yet rather unknown diseases and the aetiology remains at the least hypothetical. This syndrome is characterized by a variable hypereosinophilemia as well as a massive infiltration of several organs by mature eosinophils, causing an important tissue damage leading to organ dysfunctions and resulting in the patient death. In this reported case, the acute idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome was diagnosed in a 4-year rottweiler female dog based on an increased eosinophilemia and the infiltration of stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, spleen, ganglions, skin, lungs and bone marrow by mature eosinophiles. The acute development of the disease precluded any therapeutical hope success.","966":"During various surveillance programs more than 3500 cloacal swabs and organ samples from songbirds, waterbirds and poultry have been tested for avian influenza using real time RT-PCR. Switzerland carried out the first wildbird monitoring between autumn 2003 and spring 2005. 1053 samples, mostly from songbirds, were tested. LPAI-strains were found in two cases. A second intensified surveillance program started in October 2005 along with the first ban on free range poultry farming. Until the end of April 2006 2455 cloacal swabs from dead wildbirds have been analysed. By the end of february H5N1 was for the first time detected in Switzerland and by the end of march 32 waterbirds have been found positive for H5N1. 146 poultry flocks with a special permission for free range management proved to be AI negative.","967":"The objectives of the study were to evaluate the low-dose dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) test and the size of the adrenal glands via ultrasonography in cats with diabetes mellitus. Twenty-two cats were enrolled in the study. In 19 cats, suppression of cortisol concentrations below 5.5 nmol\/litre occurred four and eight hours after intravenous administration of dexamethasone (0.1 mg\/kg). In one other cat, the cortisol concentration was also below 5.5 nmol\/litre at eight hours but was 11.0 nmol\/litre at four hours. The results were in agreement with those of healthy cats in a previous study. The cortisol concentrations four and eight hours after administration of dexamethasone did not differ between cats with good glycemic control (n = 8) and those with moderate to poor control (n = 12). The adrenal glands of the diabetic cats were not enlarged compared with those of healthy cats. In two diabetic cats, the LDDS test results were abnormal. One cat had a pituitary adenoma and adrenal glands of normal size as determined by ultrasonography. The size of the adrenal glands of the other cat clearly differed; histological examination of the larger adrenal gland revealed an adrenocortical adenoma. Based on our findings, the results of the LDDS test using 0.1 mg\/kg of dexamethasone are normal in cats with diabetes mellitus independent of the quality of glycemic control. In addition, diabetes mellitus does not lead to a measurable increase in the size of the adrenal glands in cats. Further studies are needed to evaluate if the dexamethasone dosage used in this study is useful to diagnose mild form of hypercortisolism.","968":"","969":"","970":"","971":"Triple pelvic osteotomy has been used in dogs to maintain normal form and anatomical function of the hip in canine hip dysplasia. Pelves subjected to triple pelvic osteotomy undergo several architectural changes of different magnitudes. The aim of this study was to determine the positional changes of the anatomical structure of the pelvis after unilateral triple pelvic osteotomy in five mongrel dogs. Atrophy of the middle gluteal muscle, reduction in tension of the external and internal obturator muscles, compression on the caudal gluteal vein and entrapment of the sciatic nerve at the level of the ilial body were the most remarkable findings in the study. From an anatomical standpoint, it is suggested that the lateral rotation of the acetabulum should be kept minimal to guarantee least alterations in the normal anatomic architecture of the pelvic region.","972":"A descriptive study was carried out in the district of the Lake Geneva between March 1, 2005 and August 31,2006 to assess the incidence and prevalence of canine babesiosis, to genotype the Babesia species occurring, to assess the most frequently clinical signs found and to address the potential of autochthonous transmission. This included a data assessment on the different tick-populations occurring in the area and on the prevalence of Babesia-DNA in these ticks. A total of 56 veterinary practices participated in the study. By blood smear and PCR, Babesia canis canis was found in 12 out of 21 cases with suspected babesiosis. In an additional 13th case, the parasite could only be detected by PCR. All autochthonous cases originated from the Western part of the Lake Geneva region. Clinical signs in affected dogs included inappetence, apathy, anemia, fever, hemoglobinuria and thrombocytopenia. There were no risk factors with regard to age, sex and breed. Most cases were diagnosed during the spring periods of 2005 and 2006 (11 cases) and two cases in autumn 2005, coinciding with the main activity period of Dermacentor reticulatus, the main vector of B. canis canis. A total of 495 ticks were collected on patients by the veterinarians, 473 were identified as Ixodes sp., 7 as Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 15 as Dermacentor reticulatus. While Ixodes sp. was found in the whole study area, D. reticulatus and R. sanguineus occurred only in the Western part till Lausanne. PCR and sequencing yielded B. canis canis positivity in 3 D. reticulatus specimen, these three ticks were collected from two different dogs both suffering from babesiosis. All R. sanguineus were negative by Babesia-PCR. Global warming, ecological changes in the potential habitat of ticks, increasing host- and vector-populations and increasing mobility of dog owners may be responsible for an emergence situation of infection risk for Babesia spp. by time. E.g., Dermacentor reticulatus has become autochtonously prevalent already till Lausanne in the Lake Geneva region, and further surveillance is suggested to tackle this problem.","973":"Integrated herd health management is an effective method to improve animal health as mastitis and fertility disorders in dairy herds. For optimizing the costs and work load for the herd health management, it is necessary to have a data tool that enables a quick and comfortable data handling and provides practicable handouts for extension. The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture in Switzerland (FiBL) has developed such a database-system for the animal health management project \"pro-Q\". Objective of this database is to combine external available and on-farm collected data and to provide routine tools on herd and cow level (incl. udder quarter level) for farmers, veterinarians and advisers. These tools should give a comprehensive overview over the animal health situation of the herd and the single animal level. Furthermore, the database presented in this article, meets the requirements of a multi-user system with remote-access which enables different instances to gain the requested information.","974":"We received 190 reports of suspected adverse events (SARs) following the use of veterinary drugs for the year 2006: 118 declarations for veterinary drugs and 72 declarations following the application of immunolgical medicinal products. Most of the 118 declarations relate to the use of antiparasitic drugs (48%) and every second declaration to drug use in dogs. Other drug classes concerned were, in decreasing order, antiinfectives (20%) and drugs used off-label (12%; other target species or other indication). For the vaccines, most of the reactions occurred in dogs (62%) followed by horses (11%) and cattle (10%). The most frequently reported reactions concerned the use of a vaccine against piroplasmosis. Another 349 requests for information were processed by the Swiss Toxicological Information center.

Forty piglets aged 4 to 7 days were randomly assigned to receive a mixture of ketamine 15 mg kg-1, climazolam 1.5 mg kg-1 and azaperone 1.0 mg kg-1, IN or IM, 10 minutes prior to castration. Physiological parameters were measured. Castration was videotaped for evaluation by 3 independent observers using a scoring system. Reaction and vocalization to the skin incision and cutting of spermatic cord was evaluated and scored (0 = no reaction, 16 = strong reaction). The IN group had a significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) castration score, compared to the IM group. There was an association between castration score and room temperature in the IN group (with temperatures below 18 \"C associated with a higher castration scores (P &lt; 0.001). Heart rate was significantly higher 10 minutes after castration in the IN group (P &lt; 0.05). Respiratory rate was significantly higher in the IM group at time points -5, -1, 10, 20 and 30 (P &lt; 0.05). The IN group was walking significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) faster than the IM group. In conclusion, this combination provides effective anaesthesia for routine castration of newborn piglets when administered IM. IN administration provided shorter recovery times but had significantly higher castration scores.","978":"The goal of this study was to examine the use of an early vaccine for Haemophilus parasuis in three and five week old piglets. In the first field trial, 144 female piglets were divided into four groups. The groups consisted of animals showing no clinical signs of the disease (clinically normal) and a second group displaying clinical signs of the disease (clinically suspect). Half of the animals belonging to both clinical groups were vaccinated. In a second field trial, 240 female piglets, which were clinically normal at the time of housing and originating from the same farm were divided into two groups. Swine from one group were vaccinated, and both groups were regularly weighed and clinically examined until the end of the growing-finishing phase. Vaccinated animals from the first field trial which were clinically weighed on average 0.353 kg more than animals from the nonvaccinated control group at 11th weeks of age. Piglets of the vaccinated clinically suspected group which were 13 weeks of age weighed on average 1.41 kg more than the piglets from the nonvaccinated group. The average clinical scores for both vaccinated groups were lower than those from the nonvaccinated groups. The results from the second field trial showed that the average weight of the vaccinated group was higher by 3.1 kg than those of the control group.Also, a significant difference in weight gain was found beginning in the thirteenth week of age. The percentage of altered animals or animals unfit for growing-finishing was 8.3% in the nonvaccinated group at the end of the rearing phase.

For this purpose 20 dogs of different ages and weight were devided into 2 groups. Ten dogs were assigned to Group R, treated with carprofen, and ten dogs to Group C, which had no treatment. Radiographs of the affected joints were reviewed initially and six months later at the end of the experiment. Blood was taken 8 times from each dog. Four bone markers (Osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP), carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), serum CrossLaps (CTX) as well as 1,25-(OH)2-Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were monitored for 6 months. No significant group effects on bone markers were notied. In Group R a decrease in ICTP concentrations during the first three months and a significant decrease in CTX concentrations in the first two months of the study were observed. The bone formation marker bAP revealed a significant decrease throughout the experiment. Three dogs of Group C and one dog of Group R showed osteoarthritic progression in the radiographs. The significant decrease of CTX indicates that carprofentreatment could have a retarding effect on the progression of osteoarthritis. Radiological findings suggest that carprofen may delay osteophyte formation. The monitoring of focal metabolic processes as in bone of a osteoarthrotic joint is difficult, since the bone mass is very active and metabolic processes may have an influence on the monitoring.","981":"It is well known that, in Switzerland, communal grazing of livestock on alpine pastures plays an important role in the spread of BVD virus. Analogously, we might expect that the communal raising on farms specialising in raising heifers of animals born on different farms would also favour the spread of BVDV. This study investigated whether a persistently infected (PI) breeding heifer kept on this type of farm over a period of 26 months would put the other animals at risk of being infected. The PI-animal was in contact with 75 heifers (here defined as contact animals) on this farm. Thirty-two of the contact animals that were probably pregnant (animals at risk of giving birth to a PI-calf) were moved to 8 different breeding farms (here defined as farms at risk). On these 8 farms, 246 calves were found to be at risk of being infected with BVDV. We examined 78 calves and investigated whether the move of the pregnant animals from their original farm had permitted the virus to spread to these 8 other farms. The contact animals had a seroprevalence of 92% and the animals at risk a seroprevalence of 100%. Only one PI-animal was found on the farms at risk. This BVD infection, however, occurred independently of the PI-breeding animal. Seropositive calves were found only on 2 farms. This study did not provide any proof for a spread of BVDV with the PI-breeding animal as a source; likewise, no persistent infection was proven to exist on the farms at risk. This result is likely to be representative for the endemic situation of BVD in Switzerland. Thus, PI-animals present on heifer raising farms infect calves well before servicing. Hence, no new PI-animals are generated, and the infection becomes self-limiting. When we reconstructed the animal movements between the farms and determined the animals to be examined with the aid of the Swiss national animal traffic database (TVD) we found the data of 37% of the heifers to be incomplete and failed to successfully establish the whereabouts of 3 animals.","982":"Detection of persistent infection with BovineViral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is essential for both epidemiological and clinical reasons. In addition to the classical virological methods such as virus isolation in tissue culture, ELISA and RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry of skin biopsies has become a useful and reliable tool. Assuming that the presence of BVDV antigen in skin structures is restricted to persistent infection, this method could differentiate from transient infection. In order to answer this question, 6 calves were experimentally infected orally with a non-cytopathic genotype 1 BVDV strain belonging to the subtype k.The calves developed fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge, coughing and leucopenia with relative lymphopenia. Immunohistochemistry of skin biopsies taken daily up to day 13-post infection did not reveal any evidence of BVDV infection. BVDV was, however, isolated from blood samples on cell cultures. Anti-NS3-antibody-ELISA and serum neutralization tests showed that all six calves seroconverted. We conclude that in acute BVDV infections, with genotype 1 and the subtypes found in Switzerland (b, e, h and k) viral antigen is not found in epidermal structures of the skin. In contrast, persistently infected animals test positive for BVD viral antigen by immunohistochemistry of the skin.","983":"","984":"This paper reports three clinical cases of needle tract implantation of neoplastic cells on the abdominal and thoracic wall after ultrasound (US) fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB).

To our knowledge, the seeding of pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells after FNAB on the thoracic wall has never been reported in veterinary medicine.","985":null,"986":"In the United States, rumenocentesis has been recommended especially for early diagnosis of subacute rumen acidosis (SARA). The objective of the current study was to evaluate health risks due to the technique ofrumenocentesis and to measure pH in ruminal juice using a commercial indicator paper (Pehanon) and a pH electrode (reference method). After 11 dairy cows underwent rumenocentesis, the clinical status of those animals was evaluated daily, and cows were slaughtered as well as pathologically--anatomically examined on day 7. During the observation period, the following pathological clinical signs were evident: forced inspiration (3 cows), transient episode of hyperthermia (2 cows), increased tension of the abdominal wall (8 cows) and positive foreign body tests (3 cows). One cow had to be culled on day 7 because of severe generalised septic peritonitis spreading from the site of rumenocentesis. At slaughter, hematoma formation in the area of the puncture site was found in 9 out of 10 cows. It was concluded that the severe complications encountered with this technique do not legitimate rumenocentesis as a routine procedure for collection of rumen juice samples in cows under Swiss conditions. The correlation between the pH reference method and the commercial indicator paper was the high (r = 0.926).","987":"Historical records reporting cases of animal anthrax in the canton of Zurich between 1878 and 2005 were analysed on the level of political communities regarding occurrence and number of cases, animals affected, and number of communities affected.

A total of 830 cases of animal anthrax has been recorded in 140 of 171 communities. Occurrence correlated with industrial activities in a community such as companies handling potentially contaminated materials (hides, fur, wool, hair, meat, or bone meal). The influence of wool processing companies (P = 0. 004) and tanneries (P = 0. 032) was significant whereas horse hair processing had no effect.

The hypocalcified bone was so thin that a slight trauma induced the mandibular fracture.","990":"Avian mycobacteriosis is an important disease which affects exotic, wild and domestic birds. The disease is most commonly caused by the ubiquitous soil and water organisms Mycobacterium avium sp. avium and Mycobacterium genavense. Mycobacteriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any pet bird with chronic disease characterized by weight loss, an inflammatory leukogram and abdominal enlargement. Ante mortem diagnosis of avian mycobacteriosis in birds remains difficult. The present case report describes that even in very small species such as a budgerigar the investigating of a biopsy sample is an efficient way to rule out or confirm the disease in cases where other methods fail to be conclusive.","991":"Fluoroquinolones were originally developed for the Gram-negative aerobic spectrum, but the newer generation agents are also highly effective against some Gram-positive pathogens and cause few adverse effects. Owing to these characteristics, fluoroquinolones are often used in first line therapy in small animal practice. However, their widespread use has raised concern over emerging bacterial resistance. In this study we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of two fluoroquinolones, marbofloxacin and enrofloxacin, on field strains isolated from clinical infections between 2002 and 2005. Our data show that most of the isolates are still sensitive to both antimicrobials and marbofloxacin was more effective than enrofloxacin, especially against P. aeruginosa and beta-Streptococci (P &lt; 0.01). beta-Streptococci demonstrated the greatest resistance to the two study drugs.","992":"The goal of this study was to determine whether oral administration of sodium phosphate in conjunction with intravenous calcium is more efficaceous than intravenous calcium alone for the treatment of parturient paresis. Thirty cows with parturient paresis were examined and treated by the same veterinarian. The cows were divided randomly into two groups of 15 cows each. Cows in group A received 500 ml of a 40 per cent calcium borogluconate solution containing 15.65 g calcium gluconate and borogluconate, with a supplement of 6 per cent magnesium hypophosphite (9.85 g magnesium hypophosphite) intravenously over a period of approximately 15 min. Cows in group B received the same treatment as well as 350 g of monobasic sodium phosphate (70 g inorganic phosphate, NaH2PO4 2 H2O, Streuli) dissolved in 0.5 litres of distilled water orally via a stomach tube. After treatment, the heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, superficial body temperature, rumen motility, appetite and defecation of the cows were monitored every hour for eight h. The cows' attempts to rise and their ability to stand were also noted. Initially, the results of clinical examination and serum electrolyte analyses did not differ between the two groups of cows. Within one hour of treatment, stupor was not observed in any of the cows. The general demeanour after treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups. In both groups, the average rectal temperature increased within two hours of the initiation of treatment, from 38.0 +\/- 0.95 degrees C to 38.5 +\/- 0.40 degrees C. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate between the groups. Of the 30 cows, 22 (73.3 per cent) stood within eight hours of treatment (10 cows from group A and 12 cows from group B). The type of treatment did not affect the time required to stand: cows in group A stood within 47.3 +\/- 44 minutes and cows in group B stood within 24.2 +\/- 32 minutes after the start of treatment. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that oral treatment with 350 g of sodium phosphate together with intravenous infusion of calcium in cows with parturient paresis results in an improved outcome, even though all the cows had hypophosphataemia as well as hypocalcaemia.","993":"The results of 382 cytological examinations in dogs and 118 in cats were retrospectively compared with the correlating histological results.The histological diagnosis represented the gold standard. The investigation comprised skin, lymph node and spleen samples. The aim was to estimate the diagnostic value and the limits of cytological examinations in relation to the type of the changes. The cases were grouped in six categories: Corresponding diagnoses were formulated in 201 cases. In lymph node samples, they were reached almost twice as frequently than in skin and spleen samples. Round cell neoplasias (mast cell tumours, canine cutaneous histiocytomas and malignant lymphomas) were most often subclassified. Cytological diagnoses lacking subclassification were reached in 98 cases. The lesions were cytologically less precisely characterized than histologically. Provisional cytological diagnosis or differential diagnosis were formulated in 112 cases. Most commonly, the distinction between neoplastic and non-neoplastic character of a lesion was not possible (especially in mesenchymal spindle-cell proliferations). In 53 cases, the cytological diagnosis could not be established. In 22 cases, the relevant lesion was diagnosed only histologically whereas the cytological picture revealed another, usually secondary tissue reaction. Cytologically incorrect diagnoses were formulated in 14 cases.","994":"Five hundred young horses of the following breeds: Thoroughbred, Silesian, Malopolska, Wielkopolska, Polish Konik, Hutsul, Shetland Pony, Half-bred Anglo-Arabian, Noble Half-bred, Fjord and crosses were cytogenetically investigated. Chromosome preparations obtained after lymphocyte culture were analysed using conventional Giemsa staining and CBG-banding methods. In the case of abnormalities GTG-banding as well as FISH technique were applied. In ten mares different karyotypic abnormalities were diagnosed. One mare showed chromosome chimerism (64,XX\/64,XY), eight had sex chromosomal aneuploidy (one in pure line 63,X and seven in mosaic form 63,X\/64,XX) and one presented autosomal aneuploidy with mosaicism (64,XX\/65,XX,+31). The influence of sex chromosome abnormalities on fertility and the possible utilisation of karyotypic control in any selection programme are discussed.","995":"Behavioural and cortisol responses of lambs were used as indicators of pain and distress to assess short- and long-term effects of bloodless castration methods with and without local anaesthesia. Eighty lambs, aged 2-7 days, were control handled or castrated by crushing- Burdizzo- or rubber ring method with and without local anaesthesia. Either 4 mg\/kg diluted lidocaine, or corresponding volumes of physiologic sodium chloride solution were distributed in both spermatic cords and the scrotal neck. The serum cortisol response was monitored for 48 h, behavioural- and clinical traits over a 3-month period. The crushing castration method was excluded from the study after 10 lambs had been castrated, since this method showed severe local reactions. Local anaesthesia significantly reduced behavioural and cortisol responses after rubber ring castration and tendentially after Burdizzo castration. Prolonged or chronic pain after rubber ring castration with anaesthesia was not evident. If combined with local anaesthesia, both the rubber ring and the Burdizzo method are acceptable methods for castration of lambs up to one week of age.","996":"Behavioural and cortisol responses of calves were used as indicators of pain to assess short- and long-term effects of three bloodless castration methods with and without local anaesthesia. Eighty calves, aged 21 to 28 days, were control handled (20) or castrated by Burdizzo (25), rubber ring (25), or crushing technique (10). Either a total volume of 10 ml of Lidocaine or NaCl was distributed in both spermatic cords and the scrotal neck. The plasma cortisol response was monitored for 72 hours, and behavioural and clinical traits over a three-month period. Castration success was assessed by degree of atrophy and histological tissue examination. The crushing technique cannot be recommended due to incomplete castration success, and the evaluation was stopped after 10 animals. Local anaesthesia reduced the level of indicators of acute pain after Burdizzo and rubber ring technique. It did, however, not result in a totally painless castration. When castration is performed at the age of 3 to 4 weeks, the rubber ring but not the Burdizzo method showed evidence of chronic pain lasting for several weeks.","997":"The objective of this study was to investigate clinical signs indicating hereditary diseases like equine sarcoid, osteochondrosis (OC) and the idiopathic laryngeal hemiplegia (ILH), and to demonstrate relationships between environment, feeding habits and conformation (\"exterieur\" evaluation) of the horses. For this purpose, we analyzed veterinary examinations of 403 stallions at the approvals since 1994 examined 493 three-year-old Swiss Warmblood horses, which were shown at the Swiss-Field-Tests in 2005. With the help of the owners a questionnaire on health, environment and feeding habits of the animals was completed. At the same time, the horses were assessed and graded for their \"exterieur\" (type, conformation, gaits) by judges of the Swiss Sporthorse breeding association. In 11.5% of horses sarcoids were found, 8.7% showed one and 2.8% several tumors. The prevalence of sarcoids in offspring of sires with known sarcoids was not significantly higher than in descendants from stallions without a known history of sarcoids. We found distended joints as a possible symptom of OC in 11.4% of the horses, 3.9% (n = 19) in both tarsal joints. We did not find a relationship between enlarged joints in the offspring and the presence of OC in the sires. Abnormal respiratory noise at work, as a possible sign for ILH, was heard only in 1.2% (n = 6). It is important to note that while we found a high number of sarcoid affected horses compared to other studies, presence of enlarged joints was not very frequent and very few horses showed abnormal respiratory noise. Additionally, we found no correlation between \"exterieur\" marks and the horse's general health.","998":"The objective of this study was to investigate clinical signs indicating diseases with known or suspected hereditary components like equine sarcoid, insect bite hypersensitivity, osteochondrosis, allergic airway diseases, podotrochleosis, prognatism and wind-sucking in the franches-montagnes horse. We performed a clinical examination on 702 three-year-old, privately owned franches-montagnes horses, which were shown at the Swiss-Field-Tests in 2004. With the help of the owners a questionnaire on health, environment and feeding habits of the animals was completed. In 11.9% of the horses, sarcoids were detected, 6.2% carried one tumor and 5.7% had several. The prevalence was higher in chestnuts (16.6%) than in bays (10.1%). The prevalence of sarcoids in offspring from sires with known sarcoids (data from Station-Tests 1994-2005) was not significantly higher than in descendants from stallions without a known history of sarcoids. Clinical signs of insect bite hypersensitivity were only found in six horses (0.9%). In 12.0% hoof abnormalities like brittle horn, ring hoofs or hoof cracks of different degrees were recorded. The angle between hoof base and hoof wall was 56.7 +\/- 0.1 degrees, the average hoof width was 13.7 +\/- 0.3 cm in the front feet. For both of these measures we found no significant difference between left and right feet. With the exception of a high sarcoid prevalence, our results indicate that the franches-montagnes horse is a healthy breed overall.","999":"A weanling foal was diagnosed with proliferative enteropathy caused by Lawsonia intracellularis based on history, clinical findings of depression, anorexia, weight loss, colic, diarrhea, and ventral edema, and a combination of serology and fecal PCR. An epidemiological investigation on the premises revealed that many of the other foals and adult horses were seropositive for L. intracellularis, despite being clinically normal, and identified a dog as a potential carrier and source of infection for the foal. The foal was successfully treated with a combination of azithromycin and rifampin.","1000":"A 2-years old male Labrador retriever dog was presented with intermittent therapy-resistant diarrhoea, accompanied by vomiting, inappetence, apathy, and mild fever. The blood analysis showed an anaemia, neutrophilia, eosinophilia, and increased liver enzymes. Abdominal palpation was slightly painful. X-rays and echography revealed a severely enlarged liver with multiple cavernous structures. Histopathologic examination of liver biopsies showed a severe chronic granulomatous hepatitis with numerous parasitic cysts. Morphology of the cysts was compatible with the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. The dog was only 2-years old at the time of diagnosis. Although alveolar hydatid disease of the liver is rare in dogs, it should be envisaged as a possible differential diagnosis in cases of space-occupying processes in the liver, even in young animals, as the incubation period of this disease in the dog can be considerably shorter than in humans.","1001":"Lesion profiles are considered to be an important tool for the comparison of the various animal and human spongiform encephalopathies and to obtain information upon prion strain variations. Histological and immunohistochemical reactions (PrPsc, GFAP) in 13 brain areas at 4 levels in the brainstem from 135 BSE-positive and 45 BSE-negative cases were retrospectively evaluated. In this retrospective study a lesion profile based on histological features was worked out on the basis of BSE cases originating from Switzerland over a period of ten years. They were confirmed post mortem by histology and immunohistology. Our findings were reviewed in comparison with lesion profiles published in England. No striking differences comparing type and quality of lesions in the relevant areas between the Swiss and the English cases were evident. Moreover, the lesion profiles and the character of the lesions did not differ between animals born before or after the offal feeding ban, which supports the hypothesis that the Swiss epidemic is sustained by the same single, stable strain of the BSE agent, which is probably the same as in the English epidemic. There was a good correlation between PrPsc accumulation and spongiform changes, in particular in those areas which were morphologically most affected. Astrocytosis in BSE was quantified. A significant rise in GFAP-positive cells could be shown comparing the brain stem nuclei of BSE affected with BSE-unaffected cattle, despite considerable variation between the cases and between the nuclei. The observed astrocytosis did correlate with vacuolation of the neuropil and of perikarya as well as with PrPsc accumulation.","1002":"For horses no special tables related to nutrients for Swiss roughage exist. For this reason samples of hay, straw, silage\/haylage and green forage were taken from 46 horse keeping farms in 22 cantons. The samples were judged by sense and following the nutrient--and macromineral--content as well as the content of fructans were analysed. Regarding its quality no sample was totally inadequate for horses. The mean contents of crude protein in Swiss hay for horses were clearly lower than in hay for ruminants and in German hay for horses. The mineral contents (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus) showed a wide range. On average they were also lower than the values provided in tables for ruminants. Except for one sample the silages\/haylages showed a dry matter content of more than 40 %. No nutrient tables for silage or haylage, which are such high in dry matter contents, were found in the literature. The contents offructans in silage\/haylage and green forage also showed a wide range with a maximum of 94 g\/kg DM fructan.","1003":"","1004":"A study carried out on 49 horses showed that it is possible to measure the attention time by operant conditioning. After teaching horses an instrumental task using a signal, we were then able to test their attention time by asking them to prolong it increasingly while setting success and failure criteria. Two tests were performed 3 weeks apart. The 2nd test was feasible without relearning, a proof of memory, and was repeatable, a proof of consistency in the attention time. A significant difference was observed between the 3 age groups. Young horses often performed very well during the 1st test but their attention dropped in the 2nd test while older horses were more stable with respect to attention and even increased it slightly. The study shows that there are individual differences but it was not possible to prove a significant influence of breed, gender and paternal influence. Consequently, learning appears to be one of the most interesting approaches for evaluating the attention of horses and for observing their behaviour.","1005":"During the last 3 years, a total of 144 cats underwent echocardiographic screening at two investigational clinics before being admitted for breeding. The number of cats presented for that purpose has constantly increased. 8.3% of cats were diagnosed as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 6.9% were diagnosed as suspicious. Male cats were more affected than females (9.4% vs 7.7%). In 4.2 of all presented cats, a congenital cardiac malformation was recognised, most often tricuspid valve dysplasia.","1006":"A total of 408 cats with various cardiovascular problems has been presented to two investigational clinics during the last 8 years. The number of yearly examinations has steadily increased during this period. Definitive cardiovascular disease was diagnosed in 287 cats, whereby hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was the most common diagnosis with 67.6%. Congenital cardiovascular malformations were found in 11.8% of the cases. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) was the most frequent anomaly, in contrast to previously published studies. The ECG was found to be relatively non-specific and insensitive for the diagnosis of heart disease: Its usefulness lies in the recognition and diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. The radiographically recognized changes were also non-specific for certain heart diseases. Radiographs of the thorax are especially useful in the evaluation of cardiomegaly, and secondary signs of congestion.","1007":"We received 105 reports of suspected adverse events (SARs) following the use of veterinary drugs for the year 2005. This corresponds to a 35% increase compared to 2004. Practicing veterinarians sent most of these declarations. 73% of these concerned drugs used on companion animals. Antiparasitic drugs approved for topical use were the most frequently represented group with 48%, followed by drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders (11%) and drugs used off-label (14%; other target species or other indication). For the first time 2 declarations concerning the application of permethrin containing spot-on preparations used by mistake on cats were received. An overview of 20 declarations about adverse reactions following application of different vaccines is also presented with emphasis on the problem of fibrosarcoma in cats. We are pleased by the growing interest shown by practicing veterinarians for the vigilance system and hope to further develop this collaboration in the future.","1008":"A three-week-old Holstein Friesian calf and a 20-month-old Jersey heifer were referred to the Department of Farm Animals, University of Zurich, because of coxofemoral luxation. Both animals were moderately lame on the affected hind limb, which was swollen in the hip region and appeared to be adducted and shorter than the contralateral normal hind limb. Radiographs of the affected hips confirmed craniodorsal displacement of the femur. In both animals, traction and open reduction was carried out under general anaesthesia. The joint capsule, which was severely torn, was repaired using suture material or a non absorbable mesh. In the calf, two 4.5-mm screws and washers were placed in the dorsal rim of the acetabulum. Strong non-absorbable suture material of USP 6 in size was placed around each screw and through a pre-drilled hole in the femoral neck and back to the screw in a figure-8 pattern. The sutures were tied and the screws tightened. In the heifer, a non-absorbable mesh was attached to the dorsal acetabular rim using three 4.5-mm cortical screws. The mesh was sutured to the joint capsule at the femoral neck using strong non-absorbable suture material in a simple continuous pattern. Complications were not encountered during the postoperative period. Six months after discharge, both animals were in good general health, although the heifer had mild lameness and muscle atrophy in the operated limb.","1009":"In the present study we established a method for the determination of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in dogs and then used the assay to evaluate the adrenocortical activity in 12 dogs divided into two groups. In group A faecal samples were collected at their domestic setting. In group B, faecal samples were collected at home prior to transport to a boarding kennel, where faecal samples were then collected. In faecal samples most of the steroids were extracted with methanol and determined using a radioimmunoassay with an anti-cortisol antibody. Dogs in group A did not show any statistically significant inter-day variations in the basal levels of faecal corticoid metabolites. Faecal corticoid metabolites in dogs in group B were significantly higher on the first day at the kennel compared to animals kept at home. The peak concentration was found after 24 hours and followed by a slow decline. These results suggest that extraction with methanol and dosage with an anti-cortisol antibody by radioimmunoassay represents a valid approach technique for determination of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites and accurately reflects adrenocortical activity.","1010":"For dairy goats, both the determination of the somatic cell counts (SCC) and the interpretation of these values may be a problem. Several investigations have shown that SCC for goat's milk, even from not infected mammary halves, are often higher than for cows milk. In the three herds examined about 40% of mammary halves and 30% of the goats were infected. However large differences between the three herds could be observed. In most cases, infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) or corynebacteria. The SCC of individual milk samples from goats without any udder infection hardly differed from those of goats with at least one udder half infected with CNS. In 20% and 30% of the cases the SCC was higher than 750'000 cells\/ml, respectively. The relation between California Mastitis Test (CMT) reactions and udder infections was not very close. Over 20% of mammary halves infected with CNS showed negative CMT reactions. On the other hand, 25% of samples from mammary halves without a proven infection reacted positively. The large differences in individual cell counts on herd and animal level indicate that production and breeding systems might be important reasons for the higher SCC. As a consequence, the most common methods for or the control of udder health and udder infections (SCC, California Mastitis Test) are of limited value for goats. Since there was only a weak relation between milk quality properties and SCC, any arguments for the introduction of legal limits below 1 million cells per ml can hardly be found.","1011":"Clinical standards to confirm babesiosis in dogs include the direct identification of the infectious agent in blood smears and serological assays for Babesia canis-specific antibodies. Here, we demonstrate in seven cases (with data on anamnesis, clinics, laboratory diagnostics, and therapeutic outcomes) that a new diagnostic procedure is required. This is the molecular-genetic identification of babesia by real time PCR allowing an unequivocal identification of the infectious agents. Indeed, all seven patients presenting severe clinical symptoms were PCR-positive, but only two of them had specific antibodies and showed babesia in their bloodstream. Six of the dogs appeared to have acquired babesiosis while travelling abroad, and one in the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen.","1012":"Sometimes the name of instruments in veterinary text books and catalogs of medical suppliers points to their origin. Between 1850 and 1950 quite a number of veterinarians in Switzerland invented various instruments. They passed their ideas on or produced and distributed their inventions. The ideas originated from their daily work, such as surgery and treatments in the field of diseases in obstetrics and reproduction, udder diseases and digestive system.","1013":null,"1014":null,"1015":"The history of echinococcosis in Europe includes a period of over 2000 years. Already in antiquity metacestodes (hydatids) of Echinococcus granulosus, the causative agents of Cystic Echinococcosis (CE), were observed in animals and humans. Alveolar Echinococcosis (AE), caused by metacestodes of E. multilocularis, was identified as a disease entity only in the middle of the 19th century. It took about 100 years until it was undoubtedly clarified and accepted that CE and AE are not caused by a single Echinococcus species, but by E. granulosus and E. multilocularis, respectively. In the 20th century significant progress has been achieved in echinococcosis research, including diagnosis, epidemiology, therapy, immunology, molecular biology and other fields. However, CE and AE remain actual problems as in many endemic regions resources and structures are lacking for effective surveillance and control of these zoonoses threatening humans.","1016":"A 24-year old male sulfur-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) was presented with a subacute perforation of the cornea without involvement of the lens. The bird was treated conservatively and the eye remained quiescent up to a second traumatic corneal perforation associated with a lens capsule rupture 15 months later. Due to the second perforating trauma of an already blind eye involving the lens, evisceration of the eye was performed. Two months after surgery the cosmetic result was excellent. Treatment options for perforating ocular traumas in captive birds are discussed in detail.","1017":"In December 2005 three sheep, originating from Canton Tessin, were presented with cerebrospinal nematodosis. The animals had a history of progressive pelvic limb ataxia and recumbency. The most important clinical findings were an abnormal gait (wide stance, pelvic limb paresis) and decreased sensitivity of the pelvic limbs. The general condition was slightly or moderately disturbed, appetite was normal. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed mononuclear cells and eosinophils, suggesting a helminthic infection of the central nervous system. Postmortem findings confirmed the clinical diagnosis in one animal as parts of a nematode were found in the thoracic spinal cord. Even though the nematode could not be identified, infection with Elaphostrongylus cervi seems very likely, as the sheep are in close contact with deer on the pastures and the parasite is known to infect goats in Switzerland. This is the first description of cerebrospinal nematodosis in sheep in Switzerland.","1018":"The aim of this study was the histological and immunohistochemical evaluation and comparison of testicular, bulbourethral and brain tissue in immunized and intact control boars. Fourteen male piglets, aged between 10 and 16 weeks, were vaccinated twice subcutaneously 4 to 5 weeks apart with Improvac, an anti-GnRH vaccine. The pigs were sacrificed 1 to 16 weeks following the second injection. Testicular weight was recorded and various tissue samples were collected and fixed in formalin and Bouin's fixative for histological examination. In addition, 2 boars were immunized five times and slaughtered 60 weeks after the last injection. Histological and immunohistological studies performed on testes and epididymes showed clear signs of atrophy in the immunized animals and a significant reduction in paired testes weight was seen in treated boars. Microscopically, the mean diameter of the seminiferous tubules was markedly reduced. Spermatogonia as well as few spermatocytes were visible between the Sertoli cells and Leydig cells were atrophic. None or only few spermatozoa were detected in the epididymis. The bulbourethral glands of immunocastrated pigs were smaller than in control pigs and showed histological evidence of atrophy. Immunohistological detection of LH and FSH in the pituitary gland of treated and control boars showed no quantifiable difference in the amount of these two gonadotropins and no lesions were visible in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. From our findings it can be concluded that the anti-GnRH vaccine Improvac induces severe atrophy of testes and bulbourethral glands in immunized pigs. This effect appears to be reversible, depending on the immune response of each animal and the time elapsed after the last booster injection.","1019":"Bluetongue (BT) is a vector-borne animal disease of economical importance due to the international trade restrictions likely to be put into place in a country once the infection is discovered. The presence of BT and its vectors in countries adjacent to Switzerland stresses the need of implementing a surveillance system and to raise disease awareness among potential stakeholders. A national survey in Switzerland 2003 indicated freedom of Bluetongue virus (BTV), although a single individual of the main BT vector Culicoides imicola was caught in the canton of Ticino. The survey also demonstrated that potential BT vectors, C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris are locally abundant in Switzerland. Therefore, a new surveillance method based on sentinel herds in high risk areas was implemented in 2004 for the early detection of both an incursion of BT vectors into Switzerland, and potential virus circulation among cattle.","1020":"Bone scintigraphy is a very sensitive diagnostic tool to detect elevated bone metabolism. In cases of fractures and fissure fractures, the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the bone is said to be increased within a few hours after the injury. In this retrospective study, the scintigraphic uptake characteristics at the fracture site of 36 horses with radiographically confirmed fractures or fissure fractures were evaluated. Uptake ratios between the fracture region and adjacent normal bone or soft tissue activity respectively were calculated and compared to different anamnestic and radiographic data. The overall sensitivity of bone scintigraphy was 94.4% (34 positive cases out of 36). In the 36 horses, no correlation between the age of the fracture and the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found. However, there seems to be a lack of sensitivity in early detection of equine pelvic fractures when a standing bone scintigraphy examination protocol is used.","1021":"The objective of the present clinical report was to investigate the short- and long-term outcomes of chronic proximal suspensory desmitis (PSD) treated with Extracorporeal Shockwave Treatment (ESWT). Fifty-two horses with chronic PSD in the forelimb (34 cases) or hindlimb (22 cases) were included in the study. Three horses had lesions in both hindlimbs and one in both forelimbs. The origin of the suspensory ligament was treated every three weeks for a total of three treatments using 2000 impulses applied by a focused ESWT device (Equitron) at an energy flux density of 0.15 mJ\/ mm2. This treatment regime was followed by box rest and a controlled exercise program of 12 weeks duration. The horses were assessed 3, 6, 12, 24 weeks and one year after the first treatment. Of the 34 cases with forelimb PSD, 21 (61.8%) had returned to full work by six months after diagnosis and 19 cases (55.9%) were still in full work one year after ESWT. Of the 22 horses with hindlimb PSD, 9 (40.9%) had returned to full work by six months and 4 (18.2%) were still in full work one year after diagnosis. There was no association (chi-square test) between the outcome and the severity of the initial ultrasonographic and\/or radiographic findings. Compared with the results of other clinical studies, these findings suggest that in horses with PSD of fore- and hindlimb, the prognosis for returning to full work six months after diagnosis can be improved when ESWT and a controlled exercise program are used. However, a high rate of recurrence occurred in the hindlimb despite treatment.","1022":"In Switzerland, the incidence of equine botulism and acute pasture myodystrophy have remarkably increased in the last five years. Equine fodder-borne botulism in Europe is most likely caused by Clostridium botulinum types C and D that produce the toxins BoNT\/C and BoNT\/D. Horses showing signs suggestive of botulism (muscle weakness and tremors, reduced tongue tone, slow chewing, salivation and difficulties swallowing, drooping eyelids, mydriasis), especially patients that have fed on suspect fodder (mostly haylage), must be treated with anti-serum as soon as possible. They also need intensive care, which is often difficult to provide and always expensive in the face of a guarded to poor prognosis. Therefore, prevention (high standards of forage quality and vaccination) is all the more important. Pasture myodystrophy is an acute disease with signs of rhabdomyolysis and lethality rate over 90%. It affects grazing horses under frosty, windy and rainy conditions. Preliminary results indicate that Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium bifermentans producing lethal toxin may play a role in pasture myodystrophy. Our efforts concentrate on developing a new subunit vaccine for equine botulism and understanding the ethiology and pathogenesis of pasture myodystrophy with the goal of improving prevention against these highly fatal diseases that present a significant risk to our horse population.","1023":"Potent anthelmintics were introduced into the Swiss market several decades ago. Despite this, gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), lungworms and the large liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) can successfully inhabit Swiss ruminant farms. This is mainly due to a high reproductive capacity as well as very efficient survival strategies. In addition some species readily develop anthelmintic resistance. GIN-infections in young cattle are under comparatively good control. However, prophylactic measures are compromised where adult stock is also affected due to incomplete development of immune protection. Under these circumstances control measures must include all age groups. This results in fewer helminths in refugia thus may accelerate the development of anthelmintic resistance. This review aims to present a synopsis of the significance of the major helminth infections obtained on pasture by large and small ruminants in Switzerland. Currently available strategies for strategic helminth control are summarized and an outlook is given on new developments which might expand the spectrum of control measures relevant for veterinary practice in the future.","1024":null,"1025":"Thirteen sheep from a milk producing farm in the Canton of Grisons that presented chronic coenurosis were examined and subjected to treatment trials at the veterinary hospital in Zurich. Symptoms were first observed around two months after the import of two dogs from Italy (Abruzza) of which one was infected with Taenia multiceps and Echinococcus granulosus. The most frequently observed clinical symptoms of the sheep were reduced general condition, circling, reduced menace reflex, apathy, unsteady gait and head tilt. Analyses of cerebrospinal fluid revealed an increased leucocyte count in 3 sheep and eosinophilia in 4 sheep. In 4 animals that underwent computertomography, one or more hypodense, definable lesions were found in the brain. In 2 sheep surgical treatment and in 10 animals medical treatment with either Praziquantel (n=8) or Oxfendazol (n=2) was attempted. Only one animal treated with Praziquantel needed not to be euthanized. At necropsy, one or two coenurus cysts could be found either in a side ventricle (n=2), in the cerebellum (n=3) or in the cerebrum (n=7). The locations corresponded with the clinical findings. Despite Praziquantel or Oxfendazol treatment, living protoscoleces could be found in the parasite cysts.","1026":"Neospora caninum represents one of the most frequent abortifaciant organisms worldwide. The parasite is diaplacentally transmitted from the pregnant cow to the fetus, where it normally leads to the delivery of a healthy, however persistently infected calf. Abortion thus is a relative rare event. The transmission of bovine neosporosis occurs in more than 90% of the cases vertically due to the endogenous reactivation of a persistently infected mother. Exogenous infections are therefore responsible for less than 10% of the cases. The question arises about which infection sources may be relevant in this context. In Switzerland, the role of dogs as definitive hosts has been shown to be of low significance in that respect. Recently, discussion focused on the potential of infectious bull semen following natural or artificial insemination. Thus, a few years ago a report documented the detectability of N. caninum-DNA in the semen of naturally infected bulls by nested-PCR. As a consequence, we decided to gain own experience by investigating 5 separate semen specimens per animal, originating from 20 N. caninum-seropositive bulls used for artificial insemination in Switzerland. All probes turned out to be negative by nested PCR. Based upon our laboratory experiences, the potential bull semen-associated Neospora-problem seems not to affect the Swiss bull population, thus there is no evidence to include further respective means of control.","1027":"Lightmicroscopical (LM) and electron microscopi cal (EM) techniques, have had a major influence on the development and direction of cell biology, and particularly also on the investigation of complex host-parasite relationships. Earlier, microscopy has been rather descriptive, but new technical and scientific advances have changed the situation. Microscopy has now become analytical, quantitative and three-dimensional, with greater emphasis on analysis of live cells with fluorescent markers. The new or improved techniques that have become available include immunocytochemistry using immunogold labeling techniques or fluorescent probes, cryopreservation and cryosectioning, in situ hybridization, fluorescent reporters for subcellular localization, micro-analytical methods for elemental distribution, confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and live-imaging. Taken together, these tools are providing both researchers and students with a novel and multidimensional view of the intricate biological processes during parasite development in the host.","1028":"Trichinellosis is an important parasitic zoonosis that is caused by the intracellular nematode Trichinella spp.. Infection of humans occurs through consumption of raw (or undercooked) meat containing infectious larvae. In Europe, meat from pork, horse, and wild boar have been identified as most important sources of Trichinella infections in humans. In Switzerland, both the domestic pig and wild boar population are considered free of Trichinella. Conversely, Swiss foxes, lynxs and recently a wolf were found to be infected, the species identified in these animals was always referred to as Trichinella britovi. Although this species rarely infects pork and, compared to Trichinella spiralis, only causes reduced pathogenic effects in humans, the basic presence of Trichinella in Switzerland cannot be neglegted. This fact has gained increasing importance since the responsible authorities in the European Union (EU) are preparing regulations for the official Trichinella-control in meat in order to improve food safety for consumers. These regulations will be implemented as a consequence of the recent association of east European countries with the EU. This new legislation particularly takes into account, that in the past by far most cases of human trichinellosis in the EU were due to consumption of imported east European meat.Within the framework of the bilateral agreements of Switzerland with the EU, the Swiss veterinary public health authorities will have to comply with the foreseen EU regulations. Although diagnostic methods for the direct demonstation of Trichinella in pork meat are already routine practice in several Swiss abattoirs, the implementation of a meat control program for Trichinella for the entire slaughter pig population of the country would lead to an enormous increase in costs for the administration and will require an increased infrastructure in veterinary services. In order to find a reduced testing format for monitoring Trichinella infections in Swiss pork, an infection risk-oriented survey strategy is currently evaluated. In the present article, this minimized survey strategy is discussed regarding its compatibility with the EU regulations laying down rules for the official control of meat for Trichinella.","1029":"Companion animals are increasingly brought along by their owners to foreign countries. Thus, small animal travel medicine is becoming more important. The field includes both prophylaxis and metaphylaxis against various infectious diseases, as well as their diagnosis and treatment. Dogs returning from Southern Europe, but also from more tropical regions, may be infected with exotic pathogens. In addition, imported pedigree or working dogs, and especially stray dogs imported through welfare organisations, are at high risk. The present overview summarises the clinical and practical aspects of exotic parasitic diseases that may affect such dogs, and the risk of such diseases becoming autochthonously transmitted in Switzerland. Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of these infections will be considered.","1030":"","1031":"Ankyloglossia, commonknown as tongue-tie, is a rare congenital oral anomaly in dogs. A complete attachment of the lingual frenulum to the floor of the oral cavity leads to limited mobility of the tongue including problems during eating and swallowing. In humans ankyloglossia is a common anomaly in newborn infants. In our report a 5-month old Anatolian Shepherd dog was surgically treated and full function of the tongue could be achieved with a horizontal-to-vertical frenuloplasty.","1032":"A heifer with developmental skeletal disorder was presented to the ruminant clinic of the University of Berne. Abnormal long bone growth and a wobbling gait were the main clinical signs. All long bones were examined radiologically, several parameters of body size were measured and the results were compared to the measurements of a healthy control animal. Haematology and blood chemistry were normal. Based on the poor prognosis the animal was slaughtered. The final diagnosis of hyena disease was based on the characteristic growth disturbances in the caudal parts of the body, giving the animal a hyena-like appearance. For the first time a case of hyena disease is reported in Switzerland.","1033":"For genetic counseling this report presents a database of canine hereditary diseases and coat color characteristics, which have been solved on the molecular level. The database facilitates access to appropriate diagnostic laboratories for specific phenotypes. The recent decoding of the dog genome provides ideal conditions for the molecular genetic analysis of hereditary traits and diseases. Therefore the authors would like to encourage veterinary surgeons in particular to report cases to assist the molecular analysis of further phenotypes in future.","1034":"Bromadiolone is an anticoagulant rodenticide that inhibits the reactivation of vitamin K1 by the enzyme vitamin K1-epoxide reductase. The present case report originated from the application of bromadiolone against water voles (Arvicola terrestris) in northeastern Switzerland. At least 40 foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were found dead after the inappropriate use of a bait that contained 0.02 % bromadiolone. Anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning was suspected on the basis of the postmortem examination and subsequently confirmed by the detection ofbromadiolone both in the blood and in samples from thoracic and abdominal fluids.","1035":"The new Swiss ordinance on veterinary drugs poses a new challenge to the veterinarians, specially those working with farm animals. A complete overview about the registered veterinary drugs and immunobiologicals is absolutely necessary to cope with these new tasks: the internet version of the Swiss Veterinary Drug Compendium is a versatile tool to satisfy this needs (http:\/\/www.tierarzneimittel.ch). Due to the frequent updates and powerful search possibilities, this database is a reliable and comprehensive information system regarding Swiss veterinary drugs. We will demonstrate how this system can be used as a valuable help in the case of reconversions of drugs (e.g. use of small animal drugs in farm animals).","1036":"Organic dairy farms (OP; n=60) and conventional dairy farms (integrated production, IP; n=60), matched in size, location, and agricultural zone (altitude), were studied for possible differences in management, feeding, production, reproduction and udder health. OP and IP farms were similar in size (17.7 and 16.9 ha), milk quota (65900 and 70,000 kg\/year), cow number (14 and 15), cow age (5.3 and 5.2 years), housing of cows of the Simmental x Red Holstein or Holstein breeds (87 and 75%; 45 and 60%), but differed significantly with respect to loose housing systems (18 and 7%), outside paddocks (98 and 75%), energy-corrected 305-d milk yield (5,695 and 6,059 kg), milk protein content (31.8 and 32.7 g\/kg), use of bucket milking systems (73 and 33%), observance of regular (12-h) milking intervals (47 and 68%), routine application of the California-Mastitis-Test (10 and 28%), teat dipping after milking (25 and 43%) and blanket dry cow treatments (0 and 45%). Milk somatic cell counts on OP and IP farms (119 000 and 117,000\/mL) and reproduction data were similar and there were no significant differences between OP and IP farms as concerns available feeds, planning and management of feeding. Alternative veterinary treatments were used more often on OP than IP farms (55 and 17%). Main causes for cow replacements on OP and IP farms were fertility disorders (both 45%), age (40 and 42%), sale (30 and 37%) and udder health (35 and 13%). Between OP and IP Swiss dairy farms thus relatively few larger differences were found.","1037":"","1038":"In this study, clinical, parasitological, macroscopical, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed on 19 kids and 11 lambs (30 animals) with neonatal diarrhoea to detect the presence of Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis. Clinically, severe dehydration, yellowish-green to brown coloured diarrhoea and death were observed. Mortality rates were 10-30% in the examined flocks. The most common agent was C. parvum diagnosed in 20 animals as a single causative agent, whereas G. intestinalis was found in 5 of 30 animals. These two protozoa were detected together in 4 animals upon faeces examination. Fifteen of 24 cases of C. parvum and 3 of 11 cases of G. intestinalis were also confirmed histopathologically. Following immunohistochemical examination, all cryptosporidiosis cases were confirmed by positive immunostaining of intestinal sections. Two additional Giardiosis cases with negative results upon parasitological and histopathological examinations were diagnosed by means of immunohistochemical examination. Coronavirus was detected immunohistochemically in one kid with neonatal enteritis. Following diagnosis, herds were treated with Trimethoprim + Sulfodoxine and multivitamin complexes. Intravenous and intramuscular administrations of these drugs were effective for both treatment and prevention of neonatal diarrhoea in lambs and kids.","1039":"The microbiological meat examination (MFU), consisting of a bacteriological analysis and a testing for antibiotic residues, is one of several additional analyses used for an edibility rating of carcasses made during meat inspection. Reasons for performing a microbiological meat examination and procedures in the laboratory are defined in the Swiss ordinance for meat examination (FUV). The aim of this study was to analyze the data of 313 microbiological meat examinations from calves and 2882 microbiological meat examinations from cows carried out at the Institute for Food Safety and Hygiene during a period of 8 years. Reasons for microbiological meat examinations as reported by the meat inspectors were mainly classified to the category of \"inflammation and necroses\" (FUV, Annex 4, Pt 1.2; calves: 73%, cows: 48%). As declarations of the age of the pathological-anatomical changes (that influences directly the probability of detection of pathogens) were generally missing, it is not surprising that the compliance between a particular pathological-anatomical change and a specific detection of pathogens is poor (calves: 19%, cows: 18% of all MFU). About 18% (calves) and 45% (cows) of the reasons for microbiological meat examinations did not correspond to one of the reasons mentioned in the ordinance for meat examination. However, according to the data set, some reasons require a microbiological meat examination due to an often-found specific detection of pathogens. Otherwise, a remarkable number of reasons mentioned were missing the link to bacteriological etiology. Moreover, 14% (calf) and 7% (cow) of microbiological meat examinations with the declaration \"no pretreatment\" as well as 15% (calf) and 11% (cow) of microbiological meat examinations without declaration showed a positive result in the testing for antibiotic residues.","1040":"Switzerland is controlling Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) in cattle (BSE) and small ruminants (scrapie). Since BSE is potentially transmissible to sheep, goats or pigs through feeding of contaminated meat and bone meal, implementation of an active surveillance programme for TSE in these species is discussed. The aim of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data on the prevalence ofTSE and other neurological disorders in these populations. For that purpose, a total of 398 perished and 825 slaughtered adult small ruminants and pigs was examined for the presence of neuropathological changes. None of these animals revealed positive for TSE. However, the investigations demonstrated that perished sheep and goats exhibited a higher prevalence of relevant neuropathological changes when compared with slaughtered animals. From these results, it is concluded that perished small ruminants are probably a risk population for TSE and should be considered as target populations for an active surveillance programme.","1041":"Botulism is an intoxication caused by ingestion of feed or water contaminated with the toxin of Clostridium botulinum. In cattle, intoxication usually results from the ingestion of feed containing preformed type C or D toxin, either in feed which has been contaminated with toxin-containing carcasses or in feed in which there has been primary multiplication of C. botulinum and toxin production. The initial signs of botulism are progressive difficulty in chewing and swallowing, caused by paralysis of the tongue and muscles of mastication. This results in slow prehension and chewing of feed, water and feed falling out of the mouth, excessive salivation and weakness of the tongue. After 1 to 3 days, generalised paralysis occurs followed by death due to respiratory paralysis. Intravenous fluid therapy is the recommended treatment. The administration of antiserum is of limited value in advanced stages and is used mainly as a prophylactic measure in cattle herds in which an outbreak has just started. Active immunization of cattle in high-risk herds is also an option. It is critical that cattle not be fed feed contaminated with soil or carcasses.","1042":"","1043":"Crop disorders are very common in small psittacine birds. Psittacine birds are very curious and like chewing on different materials. Therefore, they are predisposed to ingest foreign material. In the literature only very few cases have been reported. This case report describes the clinical examination, the diagnostic workup and the ingluviotomy in a cockatiel with a bezoar in the crop.","1044":"A five-year-old, neutered male, Bernese Mountain Dog was referred because of a two-week history of hematuria and a one-week history of polydipsia and polyuria. Palpation of the dorsomedial mesogastrium revealed a mass on the left side, which was seen via radiography and ultrasonography to be attached to the left kidney. The left kidney and the attached mass were excised surgically, and the dog had an uneventful recovery. Histological examination of the mass revealed a dense proliferation of non-polymorphic spindle cells, which stained positive for smooth muscle actin via immunohistochemistry. Leiomyoma of the kidney was diagnosed. Postoperatively, there was mild azotaemia, which did not affect the general condition of the dog and was still present 15 months after surgery. Leiomyoma of the kidney is a benign tumor, and hematuria may be the only clinical sign.","1045":"A case of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy in a Magyar Vizsla dame, 7 months of age, is described. The neurological deficits such as movement disorders, hyporeflexia and muscle atrophy, were limited to the front legs. The hypertrophied cervico-thoracal nerve roots could be shown by magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis was additionally based on clinical findings, the relapsing course, the good response to therapy with prednisolone, the results of electrodiagnostic workup and muscle and nerve biopsy.","1046":"The importance of latent zoonoses has increased in recent years in view of foodborne diseases: (i) the \"healthy\" animal repesents a reservoir for specific pathogens; () no pathological-anatomical changes in the carcass and its organs show the presence of these pathogens; and (iii) these pathogens may enter the food chain via hygienic weak points in the slaughtering process. To estimate the risks involved and to take appropriate measures, analysis of the slaughtering process should be complemented by collecting data relating to the carriage of the animals of latent zoonotic pathogens. From October 2004 to June 2005, fecal samples from 630 slaughtered sheep were enriched and then examied by IMS technique and by PCR to assess the prevalence of E. coli O157 (OE). Seven samples (1.1%), distributed throughout the whole examination period, were found to be positive. To assess the potential pathogenicity for humans, E. coli O157 strains were isolated by colony hybridization and further characterized. The isolated strains fermented Sorbitol, showed four different H tys (H7, H12, H38, H48), and were all negative for stx. One O157:H7 strain harbored the gene for intimin (eae) in combination with ehxA, and paa. In consequence, the potential health hazard from sheep meat related to O157 STEC seems current not to be of particular importance in Switzerland. Results emphasize the fact that E. coli O157 are not always STEC but may belong to other pathotypes as nontraditional EPEC.","1047":"A retrospective study to evaluate the genetic predisposition for histiocytic sarcoma in the Swiss population of purebred Bernese mountain dogs identified 51 histologically confirmed cases between 1997 and 2003. Segregation analysis using five major genetic modes was used to evaluate the 51 cases. The general mode yielded the best results suggesting a genetic predisposition for histiocystic sarcoma in this breed. The disease was found in all families analyzed, therefore elimination of the disease through seletive breeding of certain family lines is not possible.","1048":"","1049":"","1050":"In this open clinical trial conducted in 10 veterinary practices, Ginkgo leaf extract was administered as a dietary supplement to 42 elderly dogs (mean age 11.4 years) at a daily dose of 40 mg\/ 10 kg body weight for 8 weeks. The \"severity of the geriatric condition\" in dogs with a history of geriatric behavioural disturbances (mean duration 12 months), was significantly reduced after 8 weeks of treatment (P = 0.0002). The positive effect was already apparent after 4 weeks. Thirty-six % of the dogs were completely free of clinical signs at study end. Overall efficacy of treatment as judged by the investigator was good or very good in 79% of the dogs. Five of six clinical sign scores (disorientation, sleep\/activity changes, behavioural changes, general behaviour and general physical condition\/vitality) also showed a significant decrease over the treatment period. In conclusion, these findings provide promising results that could increase the quality of life in the elderly dog and, as a consequence, that of the pet owner. The Ginkgo leaf extract appears to be an efficacious agent that provides a safe dietary supplement for the elderly dog with age-related behavioural disturbances.","1051":"In Chad, during a study on tuberculosis in humans and cattle, 52 non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains were isolated. By means of INNO-LiPA, PRA-hsp65 amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA, NTM species of 25\/52 isolates were identified. M. fortuitum complex (8) was the most frequent species, followed by M. nonchromogenicum (4) and M. avium complex (4). PRA method could identify M. fortuitum 3rd variant among isolates derived from cattle specimens. This finding could confirm the existence of farcy in the Chadian cattle population as M. fortuitum 3rd variant and putitative pathogen M. farcinogenes can't be distinguished by the methods used in this study. Half of the NTM isolates could not be specified and we considered them as contaminants from the environment.","1052":"We present epidemiological data from Bavaria that indicates that animals of the Brown Swiss (BS) cattle breed might be more susceptible to BSE than animals from other breeds, both in terms of disease prevalence and length of the incubation period. BS animals were disproportionately represented among the BSE cases (BS represented about 9% of the susceptible population but 27% of actual cases). BS were slaughtered at a higher age (5.8 years vs. 5.0 years for other breeds), and there is a higher prevalence of feeding proprietary feeds to BS calves than calves from other breeds. There was no difference in the recorded feeding practice of BSE-positive animals from BS or other breeds. These results would lead to expect a higher prevalence of BSE in the BS population, with BS BSE animals being of equal age or older than BSE animals from other breeds. In contrast, median age at BSE detection was significantly lower in BS animals than in other breeds (61.4 vs. 68.8 months). There was no difference in the identification categories of BSE between BS animals and animals of other breeds that could explain this difference in age. BS cattle are reported to have more octapeptid repeats in the prion protein gene than other breeds, which could account for shorter incubation periods and higher susceptibility. These observations suggest that BS animals and their tissues should be used in further studies into genetic determinants of BSE susceptibility in cattle.","1053":"In fall 2004, a survey of a representative sample of 1185 Swiss suckler beef farmers was carried out by questionnaire (return rate 51.9%). 32.7% of the respondents castrated their calves without the help of a veterinarian, 37.8% mandated a veterinarian to carry out the castrations and 29.4% did not castrate their bull calves at all. On average, 8 calves were castrated per farm and year at an average age of 7 days when the castration was carried out by a farmer or 34 days when the castration was carried out by a veterinarian. Almost all farmers castrated their calves with the rubber ring, and a majority considered no other method as feasible. 73.9% of the veterinarians used the Burdizzo technique, 14.9% applied rubber rings, and 11.2% performed a surgical procedure. 22.6% of the farmers and 85.4% of the veterinarians used sedation; local anaesthesia was performed in 32.1% of the castrations carried out by farmers and in 84.5% of the castrations carried out by veterinarians. 65.7% of the farmers were concerned by the change of the Swiss Animal Protection Ordinance (2001), when pain relief became mandatory. 47.6% of these farmers changed their castration routine: 53.1% now mandated a veterinarian, 33.0% used sedation or local anaesthesia and 8.9% abandoned castration of their calves. 59.8% of the farmers intended to participate in a future course for laymen, to study and train the technique of local anaesthesia for castration. Castration of their calves is for many suckler beef farmers an inevitable husbandry procedure. The political goal, that all calves shall be castrated with local anaesthesia can only be reached when livestock owners are informed about the distress caused by the castration and convinced of the benefit of the local anaesthesia. Veterinarians are important information carriers in this process. The implementation also produces work, be it the more complex castration procedure or the education of the farmers who want to carry out the local anaesthesia themselves.","1054":"The quality of husbandry of Franches-Montagnes horses (FM) in Switzerland is evaluated on the basis of an investigation carried out in 2002 by the Swiss FM breeding federation. Questionnaires were sent to 3500 of its members and the results include data from 968 breeding enterprises, housing a total of 3965 FM: 46.1% were breeding mares (61.0% with foal at foot), 26.5% young stock, 1.3% stallions and 26.0% non breeding stock (74.6% of which were pleasure horses and 25.4% working horses). 57.6% of the FM were housed in individual boxes with or without permanent outdoor access, 25.4% were hold in groups with or without permanent outdoor access, the remaining 17.0% were kept in standing stalls. 95.0% of the FM had at least visual contact with other equines and 99.2% had sufficient light in their stable. 88.1% were stabled on long stalk straw, while only 4.3% were bedded on other materials other than straw. The average time spent at pasture per horse and per week ranged from 96.5 +\/- 51.6 hours in summer to 27.2 +\/- 26.7 hours in winter. On average, a FM is used for 8.3 +\/- 6.5 hours per week. Horses with an paddock at their disposal spend an average of 39.8 +\/- 45.9 hours there per week.","1055":"The socio-economic structure of the breeding farms of Franches-Montagnes horses (FM) in Switzerland is evaluated on the basis of an investigation carried out in 2002 by the Swiss FM breeding federation. Questionnaires were sent to 3500 of its members and the results include data from 968 breeding enterprises, housing a total of 3965 FM. The quality of the husbandry of FM varies according to factors such as the altitude and the geographical situation of the farms and studs. Socio-economic parameters, such as the role of FM in the business, their use (breeding, driving, riding) and the age and level of professional education of the owners may also have an effect on standards of husbandry. The results show that the owners for whom FM represent a source of income more frequently keep their horses in standing stalls, but give them more time to exercise at liberty than the horses belonging to amateur breeders. Younger and better educated breeders are more likely to house their animals in groups.","1056":"The U.C. Davis Large Animal Lift (LAL) is a lightweight sling developed to help lift horses in clinical and rescue situations. Here we report on its first use in 16 recumbent horses with neurologic, muscular and musculoskeletal disorders. For each horse, history, sedation, ease and time of LAL application and hoisting, standing ability, LAL tolerance and outcome were recorded. The LAL was easily and safely applied in all horses in less than five minutes and the procedure was well tolerated with minimal to no sedation. While 10 horses were able to stand in the LAL after being hoisted, 6 horses were unable to stand and were eventually euthanized due to the inability to regain weight bearing function. The LAL has shown to be a useful devise to evaluate the standing ability of recumbent horses and can be used alone or in combination with the Anderson Sling Support Devise to allow standing support of horses with a variety of debilitating problems.","1057":"Piroplasms are tick-transmitted blood parasites belonging to the genera Babesia and Theileria. In western and southern Switzerland, B. divergens, a small Babesia species, has been known for a long time as a parasite of cattle. Recent investigations have revealed the autochthonous occurrence of this parasite also in central and eastern Switzerland. On the occasion of an outbreak of anaplasmosis in the canton of Grisons, however, B. bigemina, a large Babesia species, and Theileria of the buffeli\/sergenti\/orientalis species complex were for the first time identified; the epidemiology of these two piroplasms in Switzerland remains unknown until now. The recent identification by genetic analyses of B. divergens in wild ruminants contradicts the hitherto postulated strict host specificity of this Babesia species for cattle. B. divergens as well as the closely related Babesia spp. genotype EU1 have in single cases also been identified in splenectomized humans. The rodent babesia B. microti which causes a human infection that is considered an \"emerging tick-borne disease\" in the U.S.A., is widespread in rodent populations in Switzerland, but seems to be of minor relevance as zoonotic pathogen here. Reasons for this could be differences in virulence of the parasites or in the transmission by the respective tick-vectors on the two continents.","1058":"Two feline hemotropic mycoplasma spp. (aka hemoplasma) have previously been recognized. We recently discovered a third novel species in a cat with hemolytic anemia, designated 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis', which is closely related to rodent haemoplasmas. This novel species induced anemia after experimental transmission to two SPF cats. Three quantitative real-time PCR assays were newly designed and applied to an epidemiological study surveying the Swiss pet cat population. Blood samples from 713 healthy and ill cats were analyzed. Up to 104 parameters per cat (detailed questionnaire, case history, laboratory parameters and retroviral infections) were evaluated. 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' infection was more prevalent (8.5%) than Mycoplasma haemofelis (0.5%) and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' (1%). Hemoplasma infections were associated with male gender, outdoor access, and old age, but not with disease or anemia. Infections were more frequently found in the South and West of Switzerland. Several hemoplasma infected cats, some acutely infected, others co-infected with FIV or FeLV, showed hemolytic anemia indicating that additional factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.","1059":"About 80% of diabetic cats suffer from type 2 diabetes which is characterized by reduced insulin secretion from beta-cells and by insulin resistance. As in humans cats experienced a change in life habits and eating conditions over the last years leading to a tremendous increase in the prevalence of obesity. In both species obesity is one of the major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. Treatment should be initiated immediately after diagnosis. In Zurich, therapy consists of application of an intermediate-acting insulin and dietary management. In the latter the use of diets with reduced carbohydrate content seems to be of utmost importance. We recently found that the percentage of cats with a transient course of diabetes increases from previous 25% to 50-70% when a diet with strongly reduced carbohydrate content is fed.","1060":"The goal of the present study was to evaluate a calcium dose that was higher than the conventional dose for treatment of parturient paresis in cows. Thirty cows with parturient paresis received 1000 ml of 40 per cent calcium borogluconate solution supplemented with 6 per cent magnesium hypophosphite. Cows in group A received 200 ml of the solution intravenously over a 10-minute period, and the remaining 800 ml via a slow intravenous drip over a six-hour period. Cows in group B received 500 ml of the solution intravenously over a 20-minute period, and the remaining 500 ml via a slow intravenous drip over a six-hour period. Afterwards, the cows were monitored continuously and examined every hour for eight hours. Samples of blood were collected from all the cows before treatment and at 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480 minutes and 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment. The concentrations of total calcium, ionised calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium were determined. Cows that did not stand within 12 hours of treatment received one or more additional treatments. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate between the two groups. Of the 30 cows, 14 (47 per cent) rised after one treatment and 15 others (50 per cent) were cured after two or more treatments. One cow did not respond to repeated treatments and was euthanased four days after the start of treatment. The results of electrolyte analyses before treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups. In 27 (90 per cent) cows, the concentrations of calcium and inorganic phosphorus were lower than normal and in 3 (10 per cent) cows, only the concentration of inorganic phosphorus was lower than normal. The concentration of total calcium increased markedly ten minutes after the start of treatment in both groups, and at eight hours, the mean concentration of calcium was within the normal range. At 24 and 48 hours, the mean concentration of calcium was below normal, but at 72 hours it was again within the normal range. The concentration of inorganic phosphorus increased slowly in both groups, although it was not within the normal range at eight hours. In both groups, it achieved normal values at 24, 48 and 72 hours. The mean electrolyte concentrations did not differ significantly at any measuring point between cows that stood within eight hours of treatment and those that did not. Our results indicate that increasing the dose of calcium administered does not improve the recovery rate of cows with parturient paresis.","1061":"Lameness in horses due to pain originating from the proximal metacarpal\/metatarsal region remains a diagnostic challenge. In cases of obvious lameness the pain can be localised to this region by diagnostic anaesthesia. Because a variety of disorders can cause lameness in this region different imaging modalities including radiography, ultrasonography and scintigraphy should be used to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Even though a precise anatomic-pathologic diagnosis can still be an enigma, because not only bone and joints, but also soft tissue structures including the proximal suspensory ligament, its origin at the proximal metacarpus\/ metatarsus, its fascia, the superficial fascia, as well as the intermetacarpal\/metatarsal ligaments, the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon and both digital flexor tendons may be involved. Magnet resonance tomography (MRT) shows a high diagnostic sensitivity in imaging soft tissue structures and bone. In horses MRT is still at the beginning. The MRT appearance of the proximal metacarpal\/metatarsal region has not yet been evaluated in detail and there are only few anatomic studies of the origin of the suspensory ligament in horses. The first experiences showed, that more gross and histologic examinations are necessary to fully interpret MRT-images and to differentiate pathologic alterations from clinically not relevant variations.","1062":"Good cooperation between farrier, veterinarian and horse owner is an important prerequisite for optimal support of the horse with regards to shoeing and hoof health. The introduction of a joint educational aid aims to improve the level of education of both veterinarians and farriers. The interactive, multimedia approach represents an innovative new dimension in instruction techniques, predominantly provided through images and videos. The contents of the new teaching aid will focus on detailed anatomy of the foot and distal limb, as well as currently accepted shoeing practices and techniques and pathologic conditions of the hoof and foot.","1063":"In the past few years marked changes in the field of farriery have been noted. In addition to the classical farrier, many new occupations concerned with hoof care have emerged, such as hoof trimmer, hoof technician, hoof orthopedist and hoof naturopath. Furthermore, a tremendous number of hoof protection systems have been developed, with an ever-increasing application to horses. However, regulations regarding alternative shoeing methods are insufficient and it is not clear, who governs the quality of the work of the individuals involved. Thus, a neutral authority composed of farriers and veterinarians should be formed to develop guidelines for the education of individuals involved with hoof care and for the distribution of various farriery products.","1064":"To correctly shoe a horse requires the farriers to have a good working knowledge of postural anomalies and movement patterns, as well as of the different concepts of horseshoeing and to be able to apply the appropriate technique to every individual horse they shoe. The correct technique for specific problem cases is frequently a subject of debate amongst specialists and many theories would benefit from objective gait analyses. The case study presented examines the influence of different shoeing conditions on selected gait analysis parameters. The measurements were conducted on a Warmblood mare: (A) shod with long toes, (B) properly trimmed without shoes, (C) conventionally shod with rolled toes and finally (D) shod using the 4-point technique. Data on force-, time- and distance parameters were recorded using an instrumented treadmill. First contact and breakover of the hooves were documented using high-speed videography. A long toe resulted in a prolongation of the breakover time and, therefore, in a prolongation of the second half of the stance phase. Additionally, the prolonged stance duration associated with an unaltered force impulse, led to decreased force peaks. It was possible to objectively record differences between the trimmed, unshod foot, the shod long-toe and the shod rolled toe configurations. The differences between the rolled toe and the 4 point shoe however, were minimal. Gait analysis is a technique well suited for objective evaluation of different shoeing techniques under standardised conditions.","1065":"Fifty-four horses with hoof cracks were referred to the Equine Hospital of the University of Zurich, for treatment. The horses were admitted because of lameness or other symptoms caused by the cracks. Deep or complicated quarter cracks were the most common type of cracks diagnosed. Poor conformation and abnormal hoof shape were the most important causes of hoof crack development, whereas injury to the coronary band was a less frequently encountered cause. Effective treatment of this problem includes corrective shoeing, removing horn from the weight-bearing surface as well as from the crack with a Dremel tool and immobilization of the borders of the crack. However, even with such a therapy, the recurrence rate of hoof cracks was with 20% very high.","1066":"","1067":null,"1068":null,"1069":null,"1070":"Albert Anker broke with the old tradition to become a veterinarian and studied to be a painter at Paris. He lived from 1831-1910 and is one of the best known painters of Switzerland. His work consists of rough outlines, drawings, watercolours and numerous oil paintings (more than 800) in all fields of painting. In particularAlbert Anker gained great esteem with his numerous portraits and interpretations of the rural daily life (genre painting). Rarely pictorial representations of animals are to be found on his paintings in opposite to people. Especially these animals don't feature the fidelity of the details which is so typically for Albert Anker. Three examples demonstrate this lack and in what it consist of. An attempt will be made to explain the cause of this phenomenon.","1071":"This article describes the application of the helicoidal tomography for the study of mediastinal and pulmonal affections by small animals. The global presentation is completed by clinical cases that show the interest in this technic. A thymoma, a chronic pleuresia due to thorns and a mediastinal cranio-dorsal neoplasia provoking only lameness signs will be presentated in details.","1072":"The electrocardiographic effects of dobutamine stress testing (10 to 40 microg\/kg\/minute) were investigated in five conscious healthy dogs. We studied the changes in the duration and amplitude of P wave, PR interval, duration of QRS complex, R wave amplitude, QT interval, and heart rate. Development of arrhythmias and ST segment abnormalities were also recorded. It was observed that dobutamine significantly affects atrioventricular-nodal conduction and total electrical systole time at higher infusion rates. Only a single episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia was observed, which was promptly restored to sinus rhythm shortly after dobutamine infusion was discontinued. No ST segment abnormalities were detected. Dobutamine stress testing was concluded to play a role in some ECG parameters at higher infusion rates.","1073":"In summer 2003, a study was performed in thirty Swiss petting zoos with the objective to determine the prevalence of zoonotic agents, and to describe hygiene measures implemented to reduce the risk of human infection. Fecal samples from different animal species were collected from the floor of pens to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., verocytotoxin producing E. coli\/ VTEC and Francisella tularensis. A questionnaire on hygiene measures, number of animals per species, housing system, care procedures and feeding was administered to every petting zoo to estimate exposure of visitors to zoonotic microorganisms. In total, 423 fecal samples were examined. Of these samples, 41 were positive for Campylobacter spp., which were mainly isolates from pigs and poultry (35% positive samples from each species). In pigs, 50% of the positive samples (6 samples) were typed as C. jejuni. The others were typed as C. coli (3) and C lan' (3), respectively. Five poultry isolates were typed as C. jejuni, and two as C. coli. Two samples were positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella typhimurium was isolated from a goat, the other isolate could not be identified by serotyping. Neither Francisella tularensis nor verocytotoxin producing E. coli\/ VTEC were found. The low prevalence of zoonotic microorganisms in Swiss petting zoos could be attributed to the cleanness of enclosures and animals, low stocking rates and good animal care. However, there is room for improvement concerning visitors' information on hygiene and hand washing. Furthermore, a strict separation between picnic - areas and animals should be enforced.","1074":"A retrospective analysis of the reproductive parameters was conducted in 15 dairy farms using a herd health monitoring system between 1995 and 1998. Five of these farms have used this monitoring process for many years (group 1) while 10 of them only initiated the process in 1996 (group 2). It was the aim of this study to evaluate the economic gain of the farms in each group due to the herd health monitoring program throughout the three year study period, by using Value Based Management (VBM), a model from the economic sciences. The mean calving to conception interval decreased from 93.3 to 84.0 days and from 104.9 to 86.7 days throughout the study period in groups 1 (P&gt;0.05) and 2 (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. The mean percentage of cows with calving to conception intervals below 115 days varied between 68.2% and 82.0% in group 1, while there was an increase form 65.2% to 78.6% in group 2 (P&lt;0.05). There were no apparent trends in the reproductive culling rate throughout the study period (P&gt;0.05), and the majority fell below 10%. Likewise, the first service conception rate varied between 52.7% and 56.6% and between 41.2% and 50.0%, in group 1 and 2, respectively. The number of services per conception varied between 1.6 and 1.8 and between 1.8 and 1.9, in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The number of days between calving and first service varied between 62.7 and 64.8 days in group 1, while it decreased significantly from 69.2 to 59.2 in group 2 (P&lt;0.05). The time between first service and conception decreased from 30.6 to 22.0 days, and from 35.7 to 28.0 days in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Although there was an apparent increase of the detection rate of oestrus from 57.8% to 68.2% throughout the study period in group 1, it was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). In group 2, however, the oestrus detection rate increased significantly from 53.0% to 69.9% (P &lt; 0.05). The percent of detected oestrus within 42 days post partum increased from 33.1% to 38.1%, and from 24.1% to 40.9% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). By 1998, four out of five farms in group 1, and five out of the eight farms where information was avail- year study period of CHF 25.- to CHF 609.- per cow and year. The calving to conception interval and the reproductive culling rate were the two most important parameters to determine the reproductive performance of the herd and the economic benefit of the herd health monitoring program. These findings support the implementation of a herd health monitoring program.","1075":"","1076":"Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a rare, but potentially severe zoonotic disease caused by Echinococcus (E.) multilocularis. Recent findings indicated an increasing importance of AE for non-human primates living in regions endemic for E. multilocularis. The death of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and a lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) due to AE raised concern about the incidence of this parasite in the Basle Zoo. Consequently, a project was initiated to investigate the prevalence amongst an affected group of cynomolgus monkeys, as well as in foxes and mice. Three out of 46 monkeys were seropositive for E. multilocularis antigen. In two of these monkeys and in another three animals, which were seronegative, structures compatible with metacestodal cysts were observed using ultrasonography. Seven out of 35 free roaming foxes caught at the zoo were positive for an intestinal E. multilocularis copro-antigen ELISA, four of them shed taeniid eggs simultaneously. No lesions compatible with AE were present in 50 necropsied mice from the zoo area. These results indicate that the fox population is a potential source to introduce E. multilocularis and may thus represent a risk for the zoo animals.","1077":"Results from the elbow dysplasia screening program in Bernese Mountain Dogs of Germany were analysed in respect to its relevance for genetic evaluation and breeding. In total 2677 gradings were used. The grading was performed radiographically according to the recommendations of the International Elbow Working Group (IEWG). 75.8% of the dogs were free from visible dysplastic signs, 10.8%, 6.8% and 5.5% were classified to be of Grade 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 1.1% were classified as a borderline case between ED-free and Grade 1. A slight reduction of ED could be observed over years. Males had a 3.1 higher rate of dysplasia than females. Treating ED as a numerical trait, coded proportional to the severity of clinical relevant signs, gave a heritability estimation of 0.188 and a maternal effect of 0.07. From different mating combinations it was found, that ED average was higher in the progeny if one mate was affected but there was no increase in the prevalence with increasing grade of ED in the affected mates. About 10% more affected dogs could be observed, if one mate is affected. Heritability for dichotomic coding the trait was found to be 0.20. From these results can be suggested, that the differentiation in various grades of ED to describe the clinical relevance for the specific dog is helpfull, however, from a breeders point of view, dogs with ED should be treated equally for genetic evaluation.","1078":"For future clinical use as synthetic bone replacement, an injectable brushite-(chronOS-Inject) and hydroxylapatite-(Biobon) cement were compared in a drill hole model in 10 sheep over time at 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 24 weeks. Results were compared regarding their practical use, biocompatibiliy, resorption mechanism and subsequent new bone formation. The cements were filled into drill holes (psi 8 x 13mm) of the proximal and distal humerus, and femur and the samples evaluated macroscopically, radiologically and microscopically including histomorphometrical quantification of percentages of new bone, fibrous tissue and remnants of cements. The cement area decreased continuously from 2 to 24 weeks with chronOS-Inject, as well as the area of granules. Inversely, the subsequent new bone formation increased from 2-24 weeks accordingly. With Biobon the cement area decreased slower between 2 and 24 weeks, and the new bone formation was less. Both cements were well integrated into the bone in long bones. chronOS-Inject demonstrated good biocompatibility and was almost completely replaced through bone within 24 weeks. Biobon was resorbed considerably slower and initially a slight inflammatory reaction including bone resorption was observed within the adjacent host bone.","1079":"This study concerns the vestigial metacarpal and metatarsal bones, so called splint bones. The soft tissues, which stabilize the splint bones were carefully examined. The palmar metacarpal\/plantar metatarsal fascia, the metacarpal\/metatarsal interosseous ligaments and the fibres, which exit distally from the splint bone, were examined in depth. Cadaveric distal limbs were collected from 5 slaughtered or euthanized horses. The legs were examined both, microscopically and macroscopically. The palmar metacarpal\/plantar metatarsal fascia is a very stable structure, which connects the splint bone with its environment. The connection between splint and McIII\/MtIII, established through the metacarpal\/ metatarsal interosseous ligaments, showed impressive differences between specimens examined. Macroscopic examination of the soft tissue in the distal region showed a band structure, which originates from the distal end of the splint bone and extends in dorsal and distal direction towards the proximal sesamoid bone.","1080":"Astrocytomas represent the most common cerebral tumors in humans and in animals, and the fibrillary cytological subtype is the most frequently observed. In this report and for the first time, a thalamic astrocytoma is described in a chamois showing depressed mentation, pleurothotonus and circling to the right side.","1081":"In spring 2005, the outbreak of contagious abortion caused by Salmonella Abortusovis in 6 sheep flocks in Switzerland led to considerable economic losses. The Swiss small ruminant health service (BGK) evaluated this case. The aim was to identify the source of the epidemic in order to avoid further spread of infection and to evaluate the possibility of using vaccination. Moreover, a strategy for prevention of future outbreaks was developed. This article aims to increase disease awareness of food animal practitioners for Salmonella Abortusovis abortion in sheep.","1082":"Monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in Swiss sheep and goats is based on the examination of animals from different sources. In this study, frequencies and proportions of the different diagnoses were compared between routinely submitted sheep and goats, notified scrapie suspects as well as fallen stock. Meningitis\/ encephalitis cases were significantly more frequent (OR = 2.2) in the scrapie suspect group when compared to the routine submissions. Metabolic-toxic encephalopathy was seen more frequently within the fallen stock. Rare neurological diagnoses were more frequent among scrapie suspects and routine submissions when compared to fallen stock. Listeriosis was diagnosed equally frequent among the scrapie suspects and routine submissions but less frequent in fallen stock. Scrapie prevalence among the fallen stock and the routine submissions was 0 (zero), with 95% certainty that prevalence is &lt; 1%. The examined animals are representative for most of the Swiss regions with considerable sheep and goat production. Continuation of the detailed neuropathological examination of small ruminants from these three groups, substituted by actively testing a sufficiently large sample of fallen stock and possibly also healthy-slaughtered adult sheep and goats for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies would ensure a good surveillance within the small ruminant population.","1083":"Small ruminants infected with scrapie show a large range of often unspecific clinical symptoms. The most-often described signs, locomotion, sensibility and behavioural disorders and emaciation, rarely occur together, and cases have been described in which only one of those signs was detectable.Thus, formulating a well-circumscribed definition of a clinical suspect case is difficult. Most animals with CNS-effecting diseases such as listeriosis, polioencephalomacia, cerebrospinal nematidiasis and enterotoxemia will, in a thorough neurological examination, show at least some scrapie-like symptoms. Among the 22 neurological field cases examined in this study, a goat with cerebral gliomatosis and hair lice showed the closest similarity to clinical scrapie. The unilateral deficiency of the cerebral nerves has potential as an clinical exclusion criterion for scrapie. However, the laboratory confirmation--or exclusion--of scrapie remains important. It thus needs to be realized that a consistent and thorough examination of neurologically diseased small ruminants (including fallen stock) is the backbone of a good surveillance system for these diseases. This should be a motivation for submitting adult sheep and goats for neuropathological examination.","1084":"An overview about various observed phenomena, assumptions, and relations concerning the development of uterine torsion in cattle is presented. Furthermore, contradictory observations and old ideas are relativated and more accurate interpretations are given. It is known that the fetus himself is moving what is considered a reason for a torsion of the uterus. Intrauterine movements of the fetus are physiologic, and therefore other factors for uterine torsions are likely to be involved. A very plausible explanation for the selective occurrence of uterine torsion in cattle seems to be decreased amniotic fluid in relation to the size of fetus and uterus, because other influences can also be observed in all or at least in a high number of other animals. Destabilizing factors concerning the uterus (tonus decreased, uterus outside bursa supraomentalis) increase the possibility of developing a torsio uteri but are not compelling for the torsio uteri.","1085":"The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in strongyles was investigated in 440 horses on 90 farms in Switzerland. The egg hatch assay suggested that benzimidazole (BZ)-resistance was present in 40 of 82 farms (49%). Faecal egg count reduction after pyrantel-treatment was above 96% in 14 of 15 farms. In the remaining farm the efficacy was only 80%. Ivermectin efficacy was investigated on 5 farms and the efficacy was recorded at 98-100%. Faecal cultures undertaken after treatment revealed almost exclusively larvae of the family Cyathostominae. Data about management practices, pasture hygiene and anthelmintic usage were obtained with a questionnaire. Horses were treated on average 3.5 times per year. In 75% of the farms BZ were a component of the seasonal treatment schedule. Only the use of BZ had a significant correlation with the presence of BZ-resistance (P &lt; 0.01). Recommendations for the control of equine strongyles should include measures that minimize the risk of resistance developing against remaining effective anthelmintics.","1086":"Small strongyles (cyathostomes) that are resistant against anthelmintics have become a major problem in equine medicine in the recent years. In many European countries benzimidazole-resistant cyathostomes are widespread and are now present in well over 50% of equine populations investigated. In contrast, resistance against ivermectin has not been reported despite its widespread use in the recent years. Optimising the frequency of treatments based on quantitative faecal monitoring is of great importance to preserve remaining anthelmintic efficacy.","1087":"Enzootic pneumonia (EP) of pigs, caused by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has been a notifiable disease in Switzerland since May 2003. The diagnosis of EP has been based on multiple methods, including clinical, bacteriological and epidemiological findings as well as pathological examination of lungs (mosaic diagnosis). With the recent development of a real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay with 2 target sequences a new detection method for M. hyopneumoniae became available. This assay was tested for its applicability to nasal swab material from live animals. Pigs from 74 herds (average 10 pigs per herd) were tested. Using the mosaic diagnosis, 22 herds were classified as EP positive and 52 as EP negative. From the 730 collected swab samples we were able to demonstrate that the rtPCR test was 100% specific. In cases of cough the sensitivity on herd level of the rtPCR is 100%. On single animal level and in herds without cough the sensitivity was lower. In such cases, only a positive result would be proof for an infection with M. hyopneumoniae. Our study shows that the rtPCR on nasal swabs from live pigs allows a fast and accurate diagnosis in cases of suspected EP.","1088":"This work describes the symptoms of actinomycosis (Actinomyces bovis) in several Llamas in a herd raised in Switzerland as well as their therapy. In 5 Llamas a hematological and chemical blood examination was made where low calcium, partially low iron and copper levels were found. Various reasons are discussed which influence the bone metabolism and lead to a higher susceptibility of bone infection.","1089":"Feces from 15 adult llamas were collected in 4 herds and the exact diet was determined, either of the group or of individual animals, to examine apparent digestibility. A questionnaire was submitted to the animal owners. The questionnaire included questions about the animals in the herd (number, age, gender, origin), management methods, pastures, watering and feeding facilities for the animals, hay supplementation, composition of the ration and fodder additives used. Analysis of the feed revealed an average apparent digestibility for dry matter of 81+\/-4%, for the organic matter 77+\/-7%, for crude protein 69+\/-10%, for nitrogen-free extract 83+\/-5%, for calcium 60+\/-17%, for phosphorus 54+\/-11% and 81+\/-9% for crude fiber. All feed components seem to be digested similarly to domestic ruminants whereas the apparent digestibility of crude fiber was high, which indicates that the digesting system seems to be more effective.","1090":"In order to establish reference values for blood parameters of South American camelids in Switzerland, 273 blood samples were collected from 141 llamas and 132 alpacas. These animals were classified in three categories (young animals &lt; six months, adult females and males). Forty-one parameters were measured (red blood cell count, white blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites and enzymes). Significant differences between llamas and alpacas were evident for 26 parameters. This study also showed that differences between young animals, females and males must be taken into consideration. A comparison of blood values with the results of fecal analysis for parasite eggs showed that an infestation with Dicrocoelium dendriticum was associated with elevated activity of two liver enzymes (GLDH and gamma-GT) in the serum. In contrast, no differences were found in the results of blood analyses between animals shedding eggs of gastrointestinal strongyles or not.","1091":"At the beginning of 2000, a population of 1622 South American camelids in 257 herds was living in Switzerland. The origin of the animals, their age, the management systems, their feeding habits, their use as well as the observed medical conditions and the indications for treatment were assessed with a questionnaire. Results of this study show that 60% of the South American camelid population in Switzerland consisted of llamas (999 animals) and 40% of alpacas (623), and that females younger than 4 years of age made up the majority of the animals. South American camelids were predominantly kept for hobby, breeding or trekking. The most frequent health problems were related to the digestive tract, the skin, the eyes and the metabolism. Veterinarians were consulted for deworming, vaccinations, castrations or obstetric interventions. The parasitological examination of 204 fecal samples showed that llamas and alpacas were infested with the same endoparasites as ruminants (i.e. nematodes, trematodes and protozoas).","1092":"The dwarf rabbit often suffers from dental malocclusion, particularly on the level of the incisors. A too short maxillary jawbone in these brachycephalic animals is the cause. The treatment of first intention consists in reducing the overgrowth using a diamond bur, but like the problem repeats quickly, an alternative consists in extracting the 6 incisors.","1093":"We received 62 reports of suspected adverse events (SARs) for the year 2004. Their number and repartition according to affected animals and active substances were comparable with the previous year. The distributors or manufacturers submitted most of the declarations, but the proportion submitted by practicing veterinarians is slowly growing. 72% of the declarations dealt with adverse reactions in small animals (cats and dogs), followed by cattle and horses. Antiparasitics, anti-inflammatory drugs and immunologicals were the most frequently mentioned therapeutic classes, which are listed here according to the international ATCvet classification. A report from abroad about a fatality following injection of an antibiotic preparation for cattle prompted Swissmedic to review the security of this medication also sold on the Swiss market. It was decided to modify the package insert to warn about the danger of inadvertent self-injection in humans, to reduce the risk of similar accidents in Switzerland. We hope that the pharmacovigilance system will enjoy an increasing awareness by the practicing veterinarians.","1094":"A cross-sectional study was conducted at two large abattoirs in the winter 2003\/04 to determine the prevalence of gastric lesions in Swiss finishing pigs. The stomachs of 1897 pigs from 107 slaughter groups were examined for macroscopic epithelial lesion of the pars proventricularis. Severe hyperceratosis, erosion, ulceration and constriction at the transition between oesophagus and stomach were described as gastric lesions. Lesions were observed in 36% of all animals, with slaughter group prevalence ranging from 0% to 94%. Ulceration or constriction was present in four percent of the examined pigs. Associations between gastric lesions, farm management data, and data obtained at ante and post mortem examinations conducted at the slaughterhouse were analysed. A significantly higher prevalence of gastric lesions was found in pigs originating from conventional housing systems compared to pigs raised on farms with 'animal-friendly' housing systems providing straw bedding and outdoor exercise to pigs. In addition, significantly higher prevalence was observed in pigs originating from herds with clinical signs of tail biting and peritarsitis.","1095":"The risk of injury to veterinarians treating horses is high, particularly when performing painful procedures. The present retrospective study investigated this risk, including the frequency and severity of kick injuries, by submitting questionnaires to 700 veterinary practitioners in Switzerland. Evaluation of 216 completed questionnaires revealed that the frequency of kick injuries was affected by the professional experience of the veterinarian, veterinarians being an owner of a horse, the season, the type of procedure, the percentage of equine patients in the practice population, the treatment location (stall, pasture) and chemical restraint of the patient. Severe injuries incurred by veterinarians in recent years were few in number and the result of a number of unfortunate circumstances, which included hurried procedures due to time restraints and unforeseen events that frightened the patient. The risk factors derived from the full statistical model are the percentage of equine patients in the practice population, the treatment location, the type of procedure and chemical restraint of the patient. Using this information, it should be feasible to reduce the risk of injuries. Sedation of horses undergoing painful procedures, choosing a safe treatment location and caution on the part of the veterinarian are advised to reduce the number of injuries.","1096":"","1097":"Although Acinetobacter lwoffii is generally considered an ubiquitous and opportunistic bacterium, this germ has been isolated from the pulmonary and abdominal air sac swabs obtained from a Lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis), which died of a severe respiratory disease. Bacteriological tests (phenotypic and genotypic) led to the identification of A. lwoffii in pure culture. All the other parrots in the breeding centre were treated orally with oxytetracycline for 14 days and 3 months later no bird showed any signs of respiratory symptoms.","1098":null,"1099":"The owners of 54 cattle herds with bovine fasciolosis, as a livestock problem in Switzerland, were surveyed on their farm, on their education and knowledge on Fasciola hepatica. The aim of the survey was to assess the awareness of the farmers concerning this economically important parasitosis. The analysis of the questionnaires revealed that 72.2% of the farmers were unaware of the fasciolosis in their animals. The knowledge of 51 out of 54 (94.4%) respondents was classified as low to moderate, only four farmers (7.4%) had knowledge of control strategies in addition to the parasite cycle. The knowledge on fasciolosis did not correlate with farm data or year of graduation from school for agriculture. Furthermore, the results were compared to the answers of 33 farmers whose animals were not infected with Fasciola hepatica. Of this group of respondents 12.1% believed that their cattle suffered from fasciolosis.","1100":"The prevalence of cryptosporidia, rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and Escherichia coli F5 (K99) in dairy calves with diarrhea and in healthy calves was established in a limited area served by a veterinary practice. Immuno-chromatographic rapid tests (FASTest Strips) were applied in the field and their results were compared to the ones obtained with standard methods (modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, antigen-ELISA and cultivation). In 78% of the calves with diarrhea (n=46) and in 29% of the healthy calves (n=14), one or two agents were isolated. Of the diseased calves, 43% excreted cryptosporidia and in 46% rotavirus was isolated. Bovine corona virus and Escherichia coli F5 (K99) seemed to be of minor importance in the investigated population. Compared to the modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain or the antigen-ELISA, the FASTest Strips CRYPTO and ROTA were of very high diagnostic specificity of 100% each and their diagnostic sensitivity was 75% and 57%, respectively. Due to the low number of cases, the results of the FASTest Strips BCV and E.coli-K99 could not be interpreted. Although the diagnostic sensitivity of the FASTest Strips CRYPTO and ROTA--evaluated with standard methods--was not very high, their use in calves with acute diarrhea is recommended.","1101":"","1102":"Four weeks after the introduction of a new ration, a herd of sheep in the Swiss midland area was affected by depression, anorexia, decreased milk production, anemia, hemoglobinuria and frequent recumbency. Seventeen ewes died within a few days. A diagnosis of chronic copper poisoning was based on the results of feed analysis, histopathological findings and the toxicological examination of liver tissue. The remaining sheep were treated with oral ammonium molybdate and sodium sulfate, which together provide an inexpensive alternative to the chelator D-penicillamine.This combination not only prevents further copper intake, but also supports its elimination from the hepatocellular storage compartments. Serum copper levels have been determined to monitor the mobilization of copper following this antidote therapy.","1103":"A 10-year-old Haflinger gelding was presented with severe generalized chronic dermatitis characterized by scales, crusts and widespread alopecia with a partially diffuse and partially circumscribed pattern. Pemphigus foliaceus was diagnosed based on history, clinical signs and histological examination of skin biopsies. Typical histological findings were subcorneal pustules with accumulations of intact neutrophil granulocytes and acantholytic keratinocytes. The gelding was treated with glucocorticoids and gold salts. The skin lesions resolved completely after 8 weeks of treatment. No recurrence was observed within 1 year.","1104":"Feline dermatophytosis is a superficial skin infection characterized by the invasion of cornified tissues such as hair and nails. This infection is nearly always caused by Microsporum canis. Infected animals release infective spores in the environment which will then contaminate other animals or humans. Infected animals usually develop immunity so the infection will spontaneously disappear after a few weeks to months. Long haired and immunocom-promised cats do not have the same ability to acquire resistance and spontaneous recovery does usually not occur. The treatment of such an infection will require topical and systemic treatment of all contaminated and in-contact cats. The use of desinfectants such as bleach or enilconazole has been proven effective to destroy the spores in the environment. In addition, the efficacy of topical and systemic treatments with azole derivates or allylamines has also been demonstrated in several studies. On the contrary, dermatophyte vaccination has never been proven effective in well controlled studies. Regular follow-up and fungal cultures are mandatory to ensure succesfull treatment.","1105":"In this study it was investigated whether the \"Einsiedler\" warmblood horse, a historically old horse population from central Switzerland (Abbey of Einsiedeln), is distinguishable from micellaneous horse breeds, using molecular genetic techniques. The breeding history of Einsiedler horses is characterised by systematic line breeding through the dams. Therefore, two Einsiedler dam lines (N = 28), going back to the middle of the 19th century according to pedigree entries, were the focus of the survey. Random samples of diverse warmblood horse populations, but also samples from more distinct types of horse breeds, served as comparison populations (N = 52). Variation in the mitochondrial genome appeared to be only partially informative to demarcate the studied horses, as horses of distinct breeds may share identical mtDNA sequence fragments. Both dam lines revealed haplotypes commonly found in Iberian horse breeds. This is to take as an indication on the genetic origin of Einsiedler horses. Furthermore, the Klima dam line held a homologous mtDNA sequence fragment with E. ferus przewalskii. Therefore, this seems to be a phylogenetically old haplotype. The analysis of microsatellite loci revealed that horses from the two Einsiedler dam lines were in fact distinguishable from more distinct types of horses, but not from closely related European warmblood horse breeds and English thoroughbred.","1106":"","1107":"","1108":"","1109":"The authors reviewed pelvic radiographs of 891 dogs in a retrospective study, to determine the incidence of Unilateral Canine Hip Dysplasia (UCHD).

Comparing dogs affected uni- and bilaterally, results show a maximum of 37.6% with UCHD in dogs less than 12 month old, 22.8% in dogs between 12-24 months of age, 25.5% in dogs between 25-72 months and 14.1% in dogs older than 73 months.","1110":"Dogs with food hypersensitivity usually develop chronic pruritic dermatoses virtually indistinguishable from atopic dermatitis. These reactions are often called food allergy but the pathogenesis is poorly characterized. Several studies have addressed the incidence of canine adverse reactions to food but the outcomes were conflicting. The gold standard for the diagnosis of such a condition is the restricted dietary trial and the subsequent provocation challenge. Some attempts have been made to develop serological tests but none of these tests accurately predicted canine food sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of food hypersensitivity dermatitis and to evaluate a newly developed serological test for the diagnosis of food allergy in dogs. Only 9% of 55 dogs with dermatological signs compatible with food hypersensitivity or atopic dermatitis have been diagnosed as food hypersensitive dogs. The repeatability of the serological test has shown to be insufficient.","1111":"In a double sense, the ovine gamma herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV-2) is a virus in sheep's skin. Not only is it present world wide in all sheep breeds but also it causes malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in cattle pigs, elk, and bison. OvHV-2 cannot be propagated in cell culture. Therefore, new results from OvHV-2 research are based on molecular techniques and may be summarized as follows. OvHV-2 is transmitted by respiratory routes as well as by sexual intercourse. Lambs are infected within the first few months of life. Leucocytes, primarily latently infected lymphocytes, are responsible for disseminating the virus over the entire organism. On rare occasions, virus particles could be visualized by electron microscopy in explanted lymphocyte cultures. Structural antigens were detected by immunohistology in M-cells of diseased rabbits. Immunologically and cell biologically active genes have been detected on the viral genome.The products arising from those are thought to fine balance, the number of latently infected cells in sheep and to keep them alive without causing harm. Thus, it seems that this balance has been found through co-evolution, favoring both virus and natural host. In contrast, other host species that were exclude from the process of co-evolution, are bound to fall from MCF.","1112":"","1113":"In the last decades phytopharmaceuticals have stabilized their significance in human medicine. The aim of this study was to obtain information about the present situation of phytomedicine in three German-speaking countries. For that purpose questionnaires were sent via internet to 2675 veterinarians in Austria, Germany and Switzerland and the collected 189 answers were statistically evaluated. As shown in this paper, there is an increasing interest in veterinary phytotherapy. Presently three-quarters of the veterinarians are using phytoproducts in clinical practice. Herbal medicinal products are only seldom used in eye and ear infections as well as in endo- and ectoparasitoses but more often in diseases of the liver, joints, kidneys, heart and skin. Generally, phytodrugs are more frequently applied in chronic diseases as well as secondary medication, whereas the time of treatment usually exceeds one month. Basic advantages of medicinal phytoproducts have been shown to be the low side effects and the acceptance of the pet-owners and the only disadventage has been reported to be the lack of information. This study clearly shows the upward trend in using herbal drugs by veterinarians but the results also point to the lack of scientific knowledge about phytotherapeuticals in animal health.","1114":null,"1115":"Angiostrongylus vasorum is endemic in foxes an other carnivores in the South and south East of France, Denmark and Great Britain. The reddish nematode is present in the Arteria pulmonalis and the right side of the heart and causes respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. From 1999 to 2004, A. vasorum was diagnosed in 5 dogs from northern Switzerland, in 1 dog from southern Germany and in 3 dogs from south Ticino. Clinical signs in the affected dogs varied and ranged from cough, tachypnoea and dyspnoea to neurological symptoms in 2 of the dogs. Four dogs died and in 3 of the 4 dogs adults and larvae were found after digestion of formalin-fixed tissue. Diagnosis in the other 5 dogs was achieved by detecting the larvae coproscopically. Based on anamnestic data, these 9 dogs are probably autochthonous cases.","1116":"In a Swiss dairy farm (canton of Geneva) consisting of 73 animals 8 abortions were observed within 2 weeks. Serological and molecular biological analyses (PCR) on aborting dams, and abortion materials, respectively, revealed that the protozoan parasite Neospora caninum was the causative agent. Besides the 8 aborting animals, 12 other non-aborting heifers were found to be serologically positive for this parasite. All positive sera were further tested in an avidity-ELISA to elucidate the recency of infection. All seropositive animals but one showed low avidities at the time the abortion storm started. This indicated at a recent N. caninum-infection within the herd. Thus, the animals most probably were exposed to N. caninum-oocysts (e.g. by dog feces-contaminated forage) and the resulting abortion storm was due to an exogenous (formerly known as \"horizontal\") parasite transmission into a naive herd. This is the first documented record of such an event in Switzerland.","1117":"","1118":"","1119":"The history of Prion diseases goes further back than it appears at first sight.

This is an uncommon but potentially fatal complication especially when minimal monitoring of the patient leads to late recognition of the condition. The most typical symptoms are decreased thoracic excursions and tidal volume, absence of gas flow through the endotracheal tube, change in the capnographic waves morphology and increased airway pressures. In both cases desaturation of haemoglobin (measured by pulse oximetry) occurred in-between 6 and 8 minutes after cuff herniation. All signs normalised following partial deflation of the cuff. Careful management of cuff pressures especially when nitrous oxide is used, awareness of the condition and monitoring of the patient can prevent fatal consequences.","1125":"Toxoplasma gondii is an ubiquitous parasite with a prevalence variable from country to country. In Morocco very few studies were devoted to this prevalence. To fill this gap we were interested to study the epidemiology of this parasite and to know the level of carriage by the different vectors which are the sources of contamination in humans. The study was done by directly detecting the cysts in the cerebral tissue of the 50 sheep killed and destined for consumption. The results of this preliminary study show that 30% of the cases carry the cysts of T. gondii. To confirm this result and verify the virulence, cerebral specimens were inoculated into mice. These findings are encouraging to complete this study with serological tests and to look for the parasite in cows and goats of this region.","1126":"The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of fixed effects on somatic cell score (SCS) in Swiss dairy production. Monthly milk recording results were investigated against the background of changing housing conditions from tie-stall barns to loose housing systems. Zone, housing system and calving age within lactation number had a significant effect on SCS, as well as the covariables milk yield per day, fat and protein percentage and days in milk. Highest SCS was observed in cows of valley situated farms. Concerning housing system, best values were recorded in tie-stall barns (2.53). SCS was 0.08 higher during the changing period (2.61), and 0.12 higher in loose housing systems (2.65). SCS increased continuously with lactation number, but the differences between the age classes within lactation number were not significant. The lactation curves for SCS resembled inverted milk yield curves and were different between the first lactation on the one hand and higher lactations on the other hand.","1127":"One task of the field physiology of nutrition is the monitoring of the quality of feedstuffs. Rations may consequently be prepared with unadulterated components. This review uses the example of contamination with the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 and shows how these two unwanted substances reach the end host via the food chain and how their untoward effects are expressed in animals and humans. The extent of the contamination with artificial radioactivity is followed with periodical measurements according to the program of the Division for Radiological Protection of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The interpretation of the measurements and the directives of this division are designed to protect primarily human health, but also that of animals.","1128":"","1129":"","1130":"A 4-year old pygmy goat with chronic paraparesis of the hindlimbs was referred to the Ruminant Clinic of the University of Berne. The causative lesion was localized to the thoracolumbar spinal cord after a thorough clinical examination. Because a radiographic examination of the spine had not been diagnostic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. A mass compressing the spinal cord in the region of L2-L5 was detected. The goat was euthanized and autopsied, which allowed for the definitive diagnosis of lymphosarcoma. In addition to the changes in the lumbar area, further neoplastic masses were detected in the region of the thoracic vertebrae, near the thoracic aperture, on the lungs and on the pericardium. However, these processes had not yet caused clinical signs. MRI investigation allowed for the ante mortem diagnosis of an infiltrative mass in the spinal canal of this goat.","1131":"The purpose of this study was to describe the findings and therapy in 4 cows and 1 heifer with mummified fetus. All animals were admitted at the clinic after several unsuccessful therapies with prostaglandin F2alpha and local uterine infusions. All animals were in good condition. In case 1, diagnosis of mummified fetus could not be confirmed after manual rectal palpation and ultrasonography whereas cases 2, 4, 5 all had mummified fetus. In case 3, the fetus was in maceration. Initial therapy consisted of administration of prostaglandin F2alpha and prostaglandin E2 followed by repeated administration of prostaglandin E2. Mummies (length from apex to rump 13-32 cm) could be taken out within 3 to 6 days per vias naturales in cases 2, 4, 5 and in case 3, bones (maximal length 4 cm) could be unhinged. The structure in the uterus of case 1 could not be mobilised and was consequently removed under sight control using colpotomy followed by hysterotomy. Animals 2, 3, 4 and 5 were pregnant on the occasion of telephone inquiry. On the basis of our results, we recommend the conservative medical therapy with PGE2 for cases of mummified fetus. Colpotomy and hysterotomy are reserved as therapy feasible if the use of prostaglandin E2 is not successful.","1132":"Radiography of the equine hoof is often used to obtain a diagnosis. Quantitative interpretation, especially for research purposes requires high quality and accuracy of radiographs. The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate a radiographic technique for the lateromedial (LM) and the dorsopalmar (DP) view of the equine hoof. Ten radiographs for each view from one cadaver limb and from both front feet in a standing horse were taken in order to assess repeatability of the radiographic technique. The method requires easy to use adjustable and portable equipment and strictly defined external radio opaque markers on the hoof capsule. The digitalised radiographs were processed and analysed with the software package Metron PX, measuring 13 parameters in the LM view and 10 parameters in the DP view, respectively. Results show that with few exceptions measurements of these parameters revealed a coefficient of variation that was smaller than 0.05. It was concluded that this easy to use standardised radiographic technique ensures excellent accuracy and repeatability for both the LM and DP view. Hence, this method provides an adequate tool for quantitative assessment of the equine hoof, inter- and intraindividually.","1133":"Pharmacovigilance is a system concerned with the acquisition, evaluation and classification of informations about suspected adverse drug reactions (SADR). Such a system was developed in Switzerland under the supervision of Swissmedic after the introduction of the federal law on therapeutic products on January 1st 2002. By sending declarations about SADRs, veterinary practitioners play a central role in this scheme. The reports are processed according to international standards (ABON) and provide useful hints to enhance the safety of drug usage by both patients and owners. The system acquired 58 reports in its first complete year of operation (2003). Analysis of these reveals that trends observed in foreign countries are also applicable to Switzerland: most of the reports concerned the use of antiparasitic or antibiotic drugs in small animals. The first year also revealed a high percentage of declarations coming from the pharmaceutical companies and the authors would therefore like to encourage practitioners to take a more active part in this scheme.","1134":"","1135":"In a Bearded Collie with acute weakness, hematemesis, melena, painful abdomen and pale mucous membranes a hematocrit of 13% and panhypoproteinemia were found. This combination of findings was the manifestation of severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite intensive laboratory and imaging investigations no systemic or local cause could be identified. After repeated client interrogation it was found that the dog had been receiving a food supplement for equines. It was further detected that this supplement besides a shell extract also contained willow (Salicaceae) and meadowsweet (Filipendula, Spiraea ulmaria) which contain salicin.Thus, the administration of this supplement was considered a possible cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Even though measurement of toxic metabolites in the blood was not obtained and a cause-and-effect relationship not definitively proven, on principle it must be taken into consideration that any natural and so-called harmless agent supposed to have a positive effect may be associated with adverse effects in a predisposed individual.","1136":"In a retrospective analysis, infections of swine herds with Enzootic Pneumonia (EP), occurring after the regional eradication programme had been completed, were evaluated and described according to epidemiological criteria. The aim of this study was to obtain interim results about status, progress and trends of the area-wide eradication in Switzerland over all regions involved in the programme. The population comprised pig farms with eradication of EP completed by the end of 2002. Incidence of EP infection was calculated for the years 2000-2003. Seasonal effects, influences from production-type, herd size, and pig density in the surrounding area on incidences of EP outbreaks were investigated. In 2000-2002, annual incidences were steadily decreasing from 3.1% to 2.0%, and they showed great regional variation. In 2003, contrary to the long-term trend, a minor increase of overall incidence from 2.0% to 2.1% was observed while the incidence for breeding-only farms continued to recede. Possible explanations for this are discussed. Previous observations on EP infections accumulating in the cold season could not be confirmed. Large farms, finishing farms, and farms located in densely populated pig areas as well as farms being part of multisite production rings had a higher risk of infection. In spite of occurrence of EP outbreaks in eradicated areas, the current status of the area-wide eradication is promising, and a further decline in incidence of EP infection can be expected in the future.","1137":"Postweaning wasting is a major worldwide problem in pig production, particularly with respect to the disease termed postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In addition to wasting, PMWS symptoms include respiratory distress, diarrhoea, pallor and occasional cases of jaundice. The causative agent is porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). The objective of the present study was to determine the significance of PMWS and similar conditions in Switzerland. A total of 72 weaned piglets from 26 farms showing wasting were examined for the presence of PCV-2 by immunohistochemical and histological analysis and 57 piglets from 21 farms were examined serologically. Possible causes for wasting other than PCV-2 were investigated by macroscopic, histological and bacteriological methods. PCV-2 antigen was identified immunohistochemically in the lymphatic organs in 11 of these 72 piglets. However, only 4 animals showed histological changes typical of PMWS. PCV-2 antibodies were found in 70% of the piglets. Piglets with wasting syndrome not associated with PCV-2 infection suffered from conditions including porcine proliferative enteropathy, gastric ulcers, polyserositis and polyarthritis. The most frequent condition was chronic enteritis not associated to circovirus infection. The results from the serological analyses indicate a wide distribution of PCV-2 in the Swiss pig population. However, confirmed cases of PMWS were rare in the investigated piglets.","1138":"In summer of 2002, a case of severe clinical bovine anaplasmosis caused great losses in a dairy farm of an animal trader in Grisons. This article outlines the general approach of an outbreak investigation considering the case of anaplasmosis as an example. The goals of such investigations are to identify and eliminate the source of a disease outbreak in order to avoid additional cases. In addition, recommendations should be developed for preventing or limiting the magnitude of similar outbreaks in the future. In the outbreak presented, the causative agents were probably brought into the dairy farm by animal trade. Due to the large herd size, a missing quarantine for new animals and the coinfection with several pathogens, this case led to a high number of fatalities. The investigations of this outbreak demonstrated the importance of an universal and consistent identification of individual animals for the reconstruction of their movements. The veterinary practitioner should be reminded to act cautiously when facing strange clinical cases and to also consider \"exotic diseases\" as a possible cause.","1139":"A mammary gland tumour (MGT) was clinically diagnosed in 136 dogs. Histologically 71% were malignant and 29% benign. Intrathoracic metastatic disease was noted or suspected radiographically in 13.5% of the dogs with malignant and in 2.5% of the dogs with benign MGT. Six dogs with malignant MGT were necropsied, 5 had pulmonary metastases but only 1 had radiographic signs of intrathoracic metastatic disease. We conclude that radiographs are not very sensitive for detection of early intrathoracic metastatic disease of MGT.","1140":"To document the frequency of the different acquired cardiac diseases in the referring area of the University of Zurich, records of 474 dogs were retrospectively analysed. Most common were valvular diseases, predominantly atrioventricular valve endocardiosis (49.4%), myocardial diseases, predominantly dilated cardiomyopathy (21.1%), pericardial effusion (12.4%), mainly due to neoplasia or idiopathic pericarditis, and cardiac neoplasia without pericardial effusion (7.0%). Rare to very rare diagnoses were dirofilariosis (2.5%), endocarditis (1.1%, only 2 of these valvular), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (0.6%) and infectious pericarditis (0.4%). Arrhythmias were found in 145 dogs, mainly tachyarrhythmias, and most commonly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Relevant concomitant diseases were tracheobronchial collapse and hyperadrenocorticism in dogs with mitral endocardiosis. Knowing prevalence and causes of the various cardiac and the complicating non-cardiac diseases with clinical similarities is important for formulating diagnosis and differential diagnosis.","1141":"The antibiotic resistance pattern of respiratory tract pathogens isolated of different animal species suffering from respiratory tract diseases has been investigated by antibiograms performed by agar diffusion test. The results show that the resistance situation in Switzerland is favourable compared with studies from other countries. However, high resistance rates were found in certain species: 61% of Streptococcus spp. were resistant to erythromycin and 44% to tetracycline, 59% of Bordetella bronchiseptica were resistant to ampicillin and 50% of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica were multiresistant to tetracycline, ampicillin and streptomycine. The gram negative isolates were widely resistant to streptomycine.","1142":"Faecal samples from 186 dairy cows representing ten commercial dairy herds with sporadic clinical paratuberculosis (group A), and from 100 dairy cows from herds without a history of paratuberculosis (group B) were cultured for Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Two different decontamination methods, a NaOH\/oxalic acid method and treatment with 0.75% hexadecylpyridinium chloride (HPC) were performed prior to inoculation of Loewenstein-Jensen agar slants with and without mycobactin. Cultures were incubated for 16 weeks. Acid-fast staining bacteria were identified as MAP on the basis of mycobactin dependency and by PCR-RFLP analysis of the IS 1311-insertion element of M. avium. MAP was grown from 15 out of 186 group A animals (8.1%) whereas faecal culture for MAP was consistently negative in group B. The growth rate of MAP was significantly higher (8.1% vs. 1.6%) and the contamination rate of cultures was significantly lower (17.6% vs. 21.5%) in faecal samples decontaminated with NaOH\/oxalic acid than with HPC-treated faecal samples (p&lt;0.01, McNemar's test). Atypical mycobacteria which were grown from 46.8% of NaOH\/oxalic acid treated specimens were not obtained from any of the HPC-treated samples. A commercial ELISA with MAP-lipoarabinomannan as the antigen was used to detect MAP-antibodies in unabsorbed sera from all animals. The percentage of ELISA-positive cows was 16.8%. Overall agreement between antibody detection and MAP-positive faecal culture was 15.4%.","1143":"Between January 1997 and December 2000 blood glucose concentrations were measured in 2278 sick cats at the time of their initial presentation at the hospital. In 827 cats (36%) hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;8 mmol\/l) was documented, 1388 cats (61%) had normal blood glucose levels, 63 cats (3%) were hypoglycemic. In 674 of 827 cats (81.5%) no further investigations were performed and the veterinarian judged the hyperglycemia to be stress related. In 153 of the 827 cats (18.5%) blood glucose measurements were repeated and\/or serum fructosamine concentrations evaluated. In 106 cats (69%) stress hyperglycemia and in 47 (31%) diabetes mellitus was then diagnosed. Blood glucose concentrations in cats with stress hyperglycemia were between 8.1 and 60.4 mmol\/l (Median 10.3), in cats with diabetes mellitus between 8.5 and 70.0 (Median 27.7). Blood glucose concentrations in cats with diabetes mellitus were significantly higher than in cats with stress hyperglycemia. Cats with stress hyperglycemia suffered from a variety of different diseases, the most frequently encountered were surgical problems, neoplasia, heart diseases, upper and lower urinary tract diseases. Blood glucose concentrations in cats with heart diseases and in cats with neoplasia was higher than in cats with other disorders, however, the difference was not significant. Cats with diabetes mellitus were significantly more frequent male castrated than cats with stress hyperglycemia. Cats with stress hyperglycemia were significantly older than cats with normoglycemia.","1144":"The differentiation of acute (ARF) from chronic (CRF) renal failure is important for therapeutic and prognostic reasons and should be established as soon as possible. In practice this differentiation is often based on history, physical examination and laboratory results. In this retrospective study the diagnostic accuracy of parameters to differentiate ARF from CRF was tested in 19 dogs with ARF and 49 dogs with CRF. The diagnostic accuracy of body condition was 65%, of the hematocrit 78%, of serum potassium levels 28%, of total CO2 48%, of urinary casts 77%, of glucosuria 90% and of the urine protein-to-urine creatinine ratio 43%. Of all the parameters evaluated only glucosuria revealed an acceptable discriminating quality with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 89%. A limitation of this factor is, that glucosuria depends on the cause of ARF. The single parameters tested are not very useful and the diagnosis of ARF or CRF is based on a combination of parameters from history, physical examination, laboratory results and diagnostic imaging. If a diagnosis can't be established immediately, treatment for ARF is recommended. With an immediate, aggressive treatment the possibility of total recovery from ARF is increased.","1145":"In human medicine positron emission tomography (PET) is a modern diagnostic imaging method. In the present paper we outline the physical principles of PET and give an overview over the main clinic fields where PET is being used, such as neurology, cardiology and oncology. Moreover, we present a current project in veterinary medicine (in collaboration with the Paul Scherrer Institute and the University Hospital Zurich), where a hypoxia tracer is applied to dogs and cats suffering from spontaneous tumors. Finally new developments in the field of PET were discussed.","1146":"Pacemaker implantation in veterinary practice is still not well known and remains uncommon. However, this technique is the only possible way to cure animals suffering from symptomatic bradycardia whose state does not improve with a medical treatment. In most cases, the use of pacemakers in veterinary medicine leads to the disappearance of the clinical and electrocardiographic signs. This retrospective study concerning the last 30 years draws up an evaluation of the improvements, advantages and drawbacks of this method. Moreover, this study allows the understanding of the evolution of pacemakers' use in veterinary cardiology.","1147":"Echocardiography in ophidians shows several particularities, directly due to the anatomical features of their cardiovascular system: two aortic arches (instead of one in mammals), one single ventricle (instead of two), two cranial venae cavae (instead of one), and also one supplementary tubular cavity called sinus venosus, which proceeds into the right atrium at the sino-atrial opening. Ultrasound examination using a ventral and an intercostal approach allows a good visualisation of these cardiac structures in short and long axis. The main purpose of this technique is to establish the ante-mortem diagnosis of heart diseases, such as endocarditis and myocarditis.","1148":"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a recent ultrasound technique using an endoscopic transducer to image the heart from within the esophagus. TEE avoids the anatomical structures that may affect the quality of the conventional transthoracic echocardiography. The quality of cardiovascular images obtained with TEE is therefore superior to transthoracic views. The potential indications of TEE in veterinary medicine include analysis of specific abnormalities (thrombosis, aneurism, cardiac tumors), cardiac monitoring during anesthesia or catheterization, and evaluation of cardiovascular surgical procedures.","1149":"Three cats with spasticity on one leg or on all four limbs were presented between 1996 and 1998 at the Department of clinical veterinary medicine, Section of neurology, Vetsuisse-Faculty of Bern. The presumptive diagnosis was tetanus. A focal form was present in two cases and generalised tetanus in one cat. All cats had a history of injury at the affected legs respectively at the neck. The first clinical signs were seen between two days and three weeks after injury. The bacteriologic examination of serous fluid from the site of injury revealed an infection with Clostridium. EMG in one cat during anaesthesia showed motor united potentials (MUPs) on the spastic leg. All patients received antibiotics (Penicillin, respectively Amoxicillin\/Clavulanic acid and Metronidazol). Supportive aid were initially sedation, wound revision and in one cat nutrition through oesophageal sonde. In a second phase physiotherapy was performed. All three animals were significantly better after a couple of weeks, two cats were without symptoms after eight and five weeks respectively.","1150":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of various centrifugation methods on sperm loss and quality of frozen-thawed semen. From at a total of 8 Warmblood stallions of the National Stud Farm in Avenches, 3 ejaculates each were collected and seminal plasma was removed using 3 different centrifugation regimes. In method I (reference method) centrifugation occurred by a speed of 600 x g during 10 minutes. In method II 1000 x g was used during 2 minutes while in method III centrifugation was performed by 2000 x g during 2 minutes. After centrifugation 90%, of the supernatant was removed and sperm loss calculated. After resuspension of the pellet with freezing medium, functional membrane integrity was evaluated by HOS-test and motility determined. In frozen-thawed semen motility, viability as well as functional membrane integrity (HOS-test) and acrosome status using chlortetracyclinassay (CTA) were assessed. Our results demonstrate that mean sperm loss (I, 1.9%; II, 8.7%; III, 3.7%) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) different between the three centrifugation regimes. Regarding semen quality of frozen-thawed semen, HOS in method III (52.1%) was significantly lower than in methods I (55.5%) and II (55.3%). Evaluation of the acrosome status by CTA showed that more than 70% of sperm cells were capacitated and 25% capacitated and acrosome reacted. From our results we conclude that sperm loss and functional membrane integrity (HOS-test) in frozen-thawed semen were significantly influenced by the centrifugation regime. Therefore, stallion semen should be centrifuged at 600 x g during 10 minutes before freezing in order to obtain low sperm loss and a good quality of frozen-thawed semen.","1151":"Five cats with large, distal extremity abrasion wounds were treated with an autogenous, full-thickness, mesh skin graft. Survival of the mesh grafts in all five cats was considered between 90 and 100%. Successful grafting requires asepsis, an adequately prepared recipient bed consisting of healthy granulation tissue, proper harvesting and preparation of the graft, meticulous surgical technique and strict postoperative care. Factors that are essential for the survival of skin grafts include good contact between the graft and the recipient bed, normal tension on the sutured graft, strict immobilization after grafting and prevention of accumulation of blood or serum under the graft. Meshing the graft provides more graft flexibility over uneven surfaces and allows adequate drainage. In contrast to previous proposals, the authors recommend no bandage change before the fourth day after grafting. Full-thickness mesh skin grafting can be used to successfully treat large distal skin wounds in cats.","1152":"A retrospective study was done on 14 cats and 36 dogs diagnosed with right atrioventricular valve malformations (RAVM), either tricuspid dysplasia (n = 38) or Ebstein's anomaly (n = 12). Comparison with a large reference population including 85 250 animals allowed an epidemiologic analysis of these RAVM, demonstrating that Labrador, Boxer and Chartreux cats had a 35, 7 and 11-fold higher risk respectively to be affected by one of these heart diseases than other breeds, without sexual predisposition. In 93% of cases, cardiac auscultation revealed a heart murmur, whose grade was not significantly correlated with the echographic stages of the valvular disease. The echocardiographic examination confirmed the frequent association between RAVM and other congenital anomalies, particularly mitral dysplasia, in 84% and 20% of tricuspid dysplasia and Ebstein anomaly respectively. Last, the prognosis of RAVM was worsened by atrial fibrillation and right-sided heart failure.","1153":"","1154":"","1155":"A 18-month-old female Bernese Mountain Dog with chronic pain at jumping, extension of the right hind leg and paresis of the tail was referred to the Neurological Service of the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Zurich. Upon radiological examination a mineralised fragment at the dorsal aspect of the endplate of S1 was detected. The diagnosis of Osteochondrosis dissecans was confirmed by linear and computed tomography as well as histologic examination of the fragment, which was surgically removed. Preoperative imaging allowed a minimal surgical approach using a unilateral, modified dorsal laminectomy. Outcome was evaluated by neurological reevaluation and a CT scan performed 6 months after surgery.","1156":"Dog Registration data from three Cantons, patient data of 13 veterinary practices and registrations in the Swiss Dog Pedigree Book were collected, analysed and compared to results of a commercial household survey, to assess demographic characteristics of dog population in Switzerland. The proportion of \"pure-bred\" dogs was different depending on how the term was used, varying from 24% regarding registrations in the Swiss Dog Pedigree Book, to 75% regarding dogs with only one breed recorded in Veterinarian's patient-history-management systems. Most popular breeds were dogs called \"German Shepherd\/Shepherd\", followed by the Labrador and Golden Retriever. Comparison of different data sources suggested regional differences in popularity of breeds. The average life expectancy was estimated on 10.5 and 11 years. Sex distribution was equal. One third of all male dogs and half of the female dogs were neutered. Regardless sex, neutering was more common in cross-bred dogs than in \"pure-bred\" dogs (OR = 1.9). Some bias in all sources had to be considered and there was a major concern regarding definition of breeds. However, the study was able to add different parameters out of different sources to a homogenous picture of demographic data of dog population in Switzerland.","1157":"For this investigation 50 Brown Swiss cows from 21 different farms were used. Twenty-five peripartal overconditioned cows (back fat thickness &gt; 38 mm) were compared with 25 peripartal not overconditioned animals (back fat thickness &lt; 38 mm). On days 20, 30 and 40 post partum the ovaries were examined sonographically and 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 days after calving plasma concentrations of progesterone and 17-beta estradiol were determined. In peripartal overconditioned animals 12 ovarian cysts were found while only one cyst was present in not overconditioned cows (P &lt; 0.05). At first examination all ovarian cysts were classified by ultrasound as follicle theca cysts (progesterone &lt; 0.5 ng\/ml plasma). Follow examinations resulted in 3 cysts which persisted as theca cysts while 8 cysts became luteinized and 2 cysts completely regressed. There was no indication of increased plasma progesterone and\/or estradiol concentrations in overconditioned cows with higher fat deposit before of ovarian cysts had occurred.","1158":"To determine whether measurement of canine thyrotropin (cTSH) would aid in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, serum samples of 65 dogs with clinical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism were evaluated. Diagnosis was confirmed in 26 dogs and excluded in 39 dogs based on TSH-stimulation testing. Total thyroxine (T4) was significantly lower and cTSH significantly higher in hypothyroid dogs compared to euthyroid dogs. Canine TSH was above (&gt; 0.6 ng\/ml) in 15 (57.7%) and below the upper limit of the reference range in 11 (42.3%) of the hypothyroid dogs. All of the euthyroid dogs had a cTSH &lt; 0.6 ng\/ml. In all dogs with a cTSH above the upper limit of the reference range hypothyroidism could be confirmed. Therefore, our results show that measurement of cTSH has an excellent specificity (100%) and is a valuable tool in confirming canine hypothyroidism. However, due to the low sensitivity of cTSH assays (60%), it can not be recommended to exclude the disease.","1159":"The aim of this investigation was to describe the normal ultrasonic appearance of the intestinal loops of calves at different stages of their adolescence and at various intervals after suckling and to determine reliable reference values. Therefore the abdomen of 20 clinically healthy calves have been examined with a 5 MHz sector probe on the right and left flank of each animal and the exact position, the largest diameter, the thickness of the walls, the peristaltic activity and the appearance of the contents of each part of the intestines described. Most often, the pars cranialis duodeni could be seen ventral of the right costal arch as well as in the right flank, with younger calves it also showed in the left flank sometimes. The position could be changed considerably depending on the period elapsed since the last suckling time. The duodenum descendens and the duodenum ascendens could be traced in the right flank. The thickness of the wall was found to measure between 2 and 3 mm throughout the whole duodenum. The examination of the jejunum and the ileum was basically done in the right flank. In cases where the rumen was not yet fully developed visualization was also possible in the left flank. Most often these parts were seen in cross-section displaying permanent peristaltic activity. With the younger calves the large intestine could equally be traced in both flanks. In older animals it could be recognized as voluminous hollow organ filled with gas, or in case of the colon ascendens as garlandshape. In the jejunum and ileum as well as in the large intestine the thickness of the wall measured between 1 and 2 mm. Each part of the intestine showed an increase in diameter as the calves grew older. The peristaltic activity increased during two hours after suckling and during this time the echoing level of the contents was lower.","1160":"Borna Disease (BD) is a mostly fatal disease of horses and sheep endemic in central Europe. Antibodies to Borna disease virus (BDV) have been described in sheep and other species living in BD non-endemic areas. Meaningful clinical BDV serology is hampered by difficulties in defining serological cut-offs, which require the investigation of populations from endemic areas. Here we studied BD serology in sheep from endemic and non-endemic areas of similar geography in Switzerland. Antibodies to BDV antigens were detected by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) only in sera from 3 of 6 sheep with autopsy confirmed BD. One serum was positive by IFA but not by ELISA, while 2 sera were negative in both assays, indicating that not all diseased animals develop BDV specific antibodies. Six % of clinically healthy animals (6\/106) from an endemic area and 2% from a non-endemic area (4\/192) had serum antibody to either BDV p40 or p24 as detected by ELISA. None of the animals showed a cellular immune response to BDV p40. In some healthy sheep from the endemic area, serum antibody titers to BDV p24 antigen remained elevated over several months without onset of disease symptoms. Infections with either BDV or related viruses may thus occur at low frequency in sheep from non-endemic areas leading to the production of antibodies to BDV antigens. We further propose viral strain differences or environmental factor(s) may determine the clinical outcome.","1161":"","1162":"A 15-month-old, spayed female, Bernese mountain dog was presented to the Institute of Small Animal Surgery at the University of Zurich because of chronic left forelimb lameness. The referring veterinarian diagnosed pain in the left shoulder region and had treated the dog with systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and restricted exercise for a two-week period. The follow-up examination revealed only minimal improvement and therefore, the dog was referred for further diagnostic evaluation. Chronic bicipital tenosynovitis and tendinitis of the infraspinatus muscle was diagnosed based on survey radiographs, arthrography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and synovial fluid cytology. The dog underwent three sessions of extracorporeal shockwave therapy and substantial clinical improvement was observed. On follow-up examinations, only mild left forelimb lameness was evident following exercise, and changes in the intertubercular groove and at the supraglenoid tuberosity appeared less active on radiographs and CT. However, six months following treatment, mild degenerative joint disease was apparent.","1163":"Because cases of poisoning are observed rarely, veterinary practitioners have only limited knowledge of clinical toxicology and may face considerable problems in handling toxicological emergencies. In this report, we describe a novel decision support system for the management of poisonings in companion animals that provides rapid access to the current knowledge of clinical toxicology. For that purpose, relevant reports from the peer-reviewed literature were evaluated and organised according to the requirements of a structured database. The information provided for each toxic substance includes a summary of its chemical and physical properties, sources, commercial uses or natural occurrences, toxicokinetic data, mechanisms of action, threshold doses, clinical symptoms with brief case reports, sampling and analytical results, post-mortem findings, differential diagnoses, therapeutic guidelines and references to the literature. This decision support system has been programmed with two user-friendly search functions: a search tool that allows to choose clinical symptoms, and another function that serves to find a substance using its chemical name, the class of compounds to wich it belongs, a possible source or one of its main applications. CliniTox can be accessed directly via our webserver (http:\/\/www.clinitox.ch).","1164":"30 warmblood horses were examined before and after sedation with 20 micrograms\/kg BW detomidine, to determine changes of cardiac function parameters, using B-mode, M-mode and Doppler echocardiography. 15 horses showed a heart murmur, but no clinical signs of cardiac heart failure, 15 horses had neither a heart murmur nor other signs of cardiac disease. After sedation with detomidine we could recognise a significant increase of end-diastolic left atrium diameter, an increase of end-systolic left ventricular diameter and aortic root diameter. The end-systolic thickness of papillary muscle and interventricular septum showed a decrease. Fractional shortening and amplitude of left ventricular wall motion was decreased after sedation. The mitral valve echogram revealed a presystolic valve closure and an inflection in the Ac slope (B-notch) in xy horses before sedation. Both increased after sedation with detomidine. Doppler echocardiography showed a decrease of blood flow velocity and velocity time integral (VTI) in the left and right ventricular outflow tract after sedation. Regurgitant flow signals were intensified following sedation in xy horses, especially at the mitral valve.","1165":null,"1166":"","1167":"","1168":"The horse was domesticated by a people in Central Asia. However, it is not known where and who invented horse shoeing, an invention that increased the possibilities for using horses. The word \"horseshoe\" was first mentioned in a document from 826 p.c. Up to now an archaeologist couldn't date an excavated horseshoe. I succeeded now to establish a chronology for horseshoes found in Switzerland. The first realisation is that in the course of more than thousand years of horse shoeing history three basic forms followed each other. Moreover, the existing horseshoes can be allocated to periodical types, each in use for approximately a quarter of a century.","1169":"","1170":"The biography and family history of Samuel Vollmar author of \"Chirurgie der Hausthiere\" (1830) was discovered while researching the manuscript. The family history extends from the end of the 18th century to the present and reflects a small part of the developmental history of the veterinary profession. The manuscript is based on multiple sources. It remains unknown whether the manuscript was written at the veterinary school in Zurich or Bern.","1171":"","1172":"","1173":"","1174":"A nine-year-old intact male Drathaar was evaluated for syncope and extreme weakness, and was found to have a third degree atrioventricular (AV) block. As there were no biochemic, serologic, organic (thoracic radiographs, abdominal echography, standard and tissue Doppler echocardiographies) and histologic (interventricular septum biopsy) anomalies, the dog was treated with a permanently implanted cardiac pacemaker.","1175":"An open multi-centre veterinary clinical trial, comparing conditions before and after treatment with a herbal dietary supplement consisting of a natural resin extract of Boswellia serrata, was conducted by 10 practicing veterinarians in Switzerland. This traditional plant-based supplement is known for its anti-rheumatic and anti-inflammatory properties. 29 dogs with manifestations of chronic joint and spinal disease were enrolled. Osteoarthritis and degenerative conditions were confirmed radiologically in 25 of 29 cases. The resin extract (BSB108, product of Bogar AG) was administered with the regular food at a dose of 400 mg\/10 kg body weight once daily for 6 weeks. Already after two weeks of treatment, an overall efficacy of the dietary supplement was evident in 71% of 24 eligible dogs. A statistically significant reduction of severity and resolution of typical clinical signs in individual animals, such as intermittent lameness, local pain and stiff gait, were reported after 6 weeks. Effects of external factors that aggravate lameness, such as \"lameness when moving\" and \"lameness after a long rest\" diminished gradually. In 5 dogs, reversible brief episodes of diarrhea and flatulence occurred, but only once was a relationship to the study preparation suspected. Because quality and stability of the resin extract were ensured, these data suggest that a standardized preparation can be recommended as a herbal dietary supplement providing symptomatic support in canine osteoarthritic disease.","1176":"Sheep scab, which is caused by the mite Psoroptes ovis, is a notifiable disease in Switzerland. In the framework of an epidemiological study in the canton of Schwyz, a sheep scab outbreak on 2 adjacent alpine pastures with 62 flocks (1770 sheep) was followed up clinically, parasitologically and serologically. No mass treatment of the flocks with organophosphates or avermectins had been undertaken before the flocks were taken up to the alpine pastures, but they were treated according to their serological status. Supervised treatment of seropositive judged flocks (at least one seropositive or at least 2 serologically equivocal animals per flock) with Doramectin was undertaken, whilst seronegative judged flocks remained untreated. Sheep returned from the summer pastures in early September 2001 and within three months scab infestation was diagnosed in 53 flocks (85.5%). These infested flocks were scattered all over the canton. Furthermore, the transfer of sheep from 6 infested flocks resulted in the transmission of the disease to 10 new flocks. Infested flocks were kept in quarantine and sanitized. The complexity of the traditional use of shared alpine pastures and the intense, uncontrolled trading with animals render the control of sheep scab difficult.","1177":"","1178":"","1179":"This case report describes the treatment of demodicosis (Demodex caprae) in 2 goats.

One goat was administered 0.67 mg\/kg Ivermectin orally once weekly for 12 weeks, the other goat was treated with 0.5 mg\/kg Eprinomectin pour-on. The treatment led to an entire healing without any scar formation or depigmentations of the skin.","1180":"Results of scientific studies are obtained by analysing of the present knowledge of a current problem and a corresponding new experimental set-up. Under ideal conditions the data of the new study agree with the deduced working hypothesis. This general consideration is true for the well established correlation between K content and growth rates of plants. At low K concentrations (up to 3% of dry matter) K causes a linear increase of growth and finally a saturation. This positive effect of K on growth rates of plants is accompanied by some side effects. There is no doubt that a high intake of K is involved in the pathogenesis of grass tetany and of milk fever. The present publication gives some information about this correlation and discusses the discrepancy between the intention of a scientific study and possible \"side effects\", which cannot be predicted in many cases.","1181":"100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), 100 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 100 strains of Streptococcus spp. and 100 strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), isolated from bovine mastitis milk samples between November 2002 and April 2003, were tested for their sensitivity to various antibiotics by means of the agar diffusion method. The antibiotics were chosen on the basis of their licenses for intramammary application in Switzerland (www.vetpharm.unizh.ch). 91% of the S. aureus strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. Only 9% of the strains were resistant to Penicillin G and 7% to Ampicillin. 53% of the CNS strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. 31% exhibited resistance to Penicillin G, 26% to Ampicillin, 16% to Cloxacillin and 14% to Lincomycin. 30% of the Streptococcus spp. strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. 4% were resistant to Penicillin G, 4% to Amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid, 1% to Cefoperazone, 2% to Cefquinome, 35% to Neomycin, 22% to Gentamicin, 61% to Kanamy-cin and 11% to Lincomycin. 43% of the strains showed multiple resistance. 79% of the E. coli strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. 20% exhibited resistance to Ampicillin, 9% to Neomycin and 10% to Kanamycin. A comparison of the own results with data of other authors in Switzerland shows no important changes in the resistance situation during the last 20 years. With the exception of two strains (Streptococcus spp.), all tested isolates were sensible against Cefquinome.","1182":"The recent outbreak of anaplasmosis in a Swiss cattle herd triggered a discussion of the risk of vector-borne diseases in animals and humans in relation to climate changes and other factors. This overview presents the Swiss Tropical Institute's (STI) activities on vector-borne diseases (malaria, trypanosomosis, and leishmaniosis in humans and tick-borne diseases in livestock), describes the possible risks for humans and animals in Switzerland, and discusses options for action in the domains of public health, livestock production and companion animals. Switzerland is increasingly confronted with vector-borne diseases in humans and animals, but this is mainly due to an increase in imported cases. The emergence of a disease in one sector (human or veterinary medicine) may predict future trends in the other. A stronger intersectoral collaboration between public health and veterinary institutions at the federal and cantonal level is needed.","1183":"Generation of blood glucose curves is essential to monitor glycemic control in dogs and cats with diabetes mellitus. Up till now blood collection and blood glucose measurements could only be performed in a hospital. However, glucose concentrations measured in a hospital environment can markedly differ from concentrations measured at home, due to reduced appetite, different activity level and stressful handling. At the Clinic of Small Animal Internal Medicine, University of Zurich, a new method to collect capillary blood from the ear and to measure blood glucose by means of a portable glucose meter has been developed. This method enables owners of diabetic dogs or cats to determine blood glucose concentrations and generate blood glucose curves at home. Three cases demonstrate, how much blood glucose concentrations at home may differ from those in the hospital and how home monitoring can help to establish diabetic control in dogs and cats.","1184":"In a time period of 6 years, 158 congenital cardiac defects were diagnosed in 146 dogs at the Clinic for Small Animal Medicine University of Zurich. In respect to all dogs with cardiac disease, these were 23.5% of the cases. Most common defects were subaortic stenosis (SAS, 31.5%), pulmonic stenosis (PS, 23.3%), ventricular septal defect (VSD, 14.4%), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, 13.7%) and tricuspid dysplasia (TD, 7.5%). Complex defects were found in 8.2% of the dogs. Although single dogs per breed were affected by various defects, some breed-related tendencies could be observed. We found PS more numerously in boxers and Jack Russell Terriers whereas SAS, VSD and TD were also found in breeds reported to be predisposed. Congenital cardiac defects are an important clinical entity, and knowledge of prevalence is helpful when considering the differential diagnosis and for making a tentative diagnosis in an individual case.","1185":"In the last decade, the organic agriculture in Switzerland has been substantially increased due to the interest of consumer and financial incentives of the federation. Ruminants take directly or indirectly the largest part from grassland used within the organic managed surfaces. As the contacts between veterinary practice and organic agriculture has increased, the potential for veterinary activity in this area has developed considerably. The organic agriculture guidelines stipulate that all the preventive measures should be taken in feeding, keeping and breeding to insure animal health safety. This requires veterinary services for herd management. The organic status of a farm affects veterinary practice also in the form of alternative therapy\/drugs administration and measures like dehorning and tail-docking. An important point in organic managed herds requests that treatment of animals should depend on alternative medical preparations or procedures based on veterinarian's experience and also on the therapeutic effect on the animal species concerned as well as on the disease. However, there are no restrictions on the veterinarian to use registered drugs as long as no alternative therapy, according to experience and possible success, is available to treat the animals. The prophylactic administration of allopathic veterinary drugs is not permissible. Further features in organic farms regarding the use of drugs are the keeping of withholding\/withdrawal time, the documentation and the treatment frequency tolerated by organic marketing. Despite the above measures, the animal health has a priority regardless of its organic status. Although management of organic farms represent a unique responsibility, there are still obvious deficits in the education of veterinary practitioners for this new situation. However, in the future the extension of veterinary activity to include the alternative medical therapy should be regarded for the practitioner as a challenge and an opportunity at the same time.","1186":"The mammalian gastrointestinal tract is a complex consisting of the intestinal epithelial cells, the mucosal immune cells and the endogenous microflora. Since a couple of years, probiotics are used in animal production to improve performance. But there are only few results available on the immune modulating effects of pro- and prebiotics in human and veterinary medicine. Recent studies are promising that pro- and prebiotics can be used as an alternative to conventional therapy with immune suppressive drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or dietary hypersensitivity. Yet further randomized and placebo-controlled studies are needed to clarify these mechanisms in vivo.","1187":"","1188":"An 8 year old, intact female, Old English Sheepdog was presented with lethargy and chronic weight loss of one year duration. The dog suffered from recurrent fever and a mild peripheral lymphadenopathy. Mild thrombocytopenia, monoclonal hyperglobulinemia and positive Ehrlichia canis antibody titer were indicative of Ehrlichiosis. The patient developed proteinuria and renal failure, which suggested the presence of glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemical staining of renal biopsy specimen demonstrated AA amyloidosis. Chronic ehrlichiosis was suspected to be the cause of the dog's renal amyloidosis.","1189":"The present study gives an overview about the knowledge and the diagnostic possibilities of the proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in fishes. This disease is responsible for economically significant losses in farmed fish and severe reductions in wild fish populations in Europe and North America. PKD is affecting mainly salmonid species. In Swiss rivers the proliferative kidney disease pictures the highest percentage of diseases among brown trouts. The main symptom of PKD is a massive proliferation of the interstitial kidney tissue which named the disease. Other unspecific symptoms are anemia, ascites, exophthalmus and apathy. The causative agent of the disease is Tetracapsula bryosalmonae (Myxozoa). Many aspects of the life cycle of this parasite remain unclear so far but it is known that the appearance of this parasite is linked to the presence of a range of freshwater bryozoans. PKD appears mostly in summer during high water temperatures (&gt; or = 15 degrees C) and can lead to high mortality rates. A diagnosis can be made by using light-microscopic, lectinimmunhistochemical as well as molecular biological methods. Before we can develop successful management strategies the knowledge gaps in understanding the disease cycle and the exact pathogenesis of PKD need to be closed.","1190":"Aosta Valley is the only region of Italy free of reported human cases of dirofilariosis due to Dirofilaria repens. Nonetheless, the retrospective analysis of five locally acquired D. repens infections in dogs, seems to indicate that an animal reservoir exist in the area. A feline case imported from Camargue, France, is also described. The most common dermatological signs were erythema, alopecia, crusting, papulae and nodules. All patients had lesional pruritus and dogs were affected by concurrent babesiosis. Eradication of the underlying condition, followed by a therapy with the specific adulticide and microfilaricide drugs led to a complete recovery of microfilaraemia. Increased pet travel and ecological changes are extending the ranges of vector borne, parasitic and zoonotic diseases. This fact pose a unique diagnostic challenge for the veterinarian, since the index of suspicion may be absent outside endemic areas.","1191":"During eight years, in 17 cattle a septic arthritis of the shoulder or hip joint was diagnosed at the Veterinary Surgery Department, University of Munich. The diagnosis was based on the results of the synoviocentesis and confirmed by ultrasound and radiographic examination. The average number of leucocytes in the synovia was 65,137\/microliter (median 43.344\/microliter), with 97% neutrophils (median 96%). Of the 17 animals, 13 were treated. In two patients arthrotomy, and in 11 repeated joint lavage was performed. As a lavage solution, 500 to 1000 ml of Ringer's solution, with 800 to 1600 mg Gentamicin added, was used. Four animals were not treated because of advanced radiographic changes (1), purulent arthritis and phlegmon (1) or economic reasons (2). Ten patients could be cured long-term (follow up time 10.5 months on average, median 6.5 months), three remained lame and were slaughtered. As a conclusion, septic arthritis of the shoulder or the hip joint in cattle has a good prognosis when diagnosed and treated early.","1192":"A 5-month-old female Rottweiler was referred because of a 5-week diarrhea and a sudden onset of a cardiac murmur auscultated by its veterinarian. Definitive diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was based on ultrasonographic visualization of vegetative cardiac lesions and positive cultures of Enterococcus faecalis in blood and urine. Complicating findings were suppurative nephritis and renal infarction. Despite intensive supportive care, the endocarditis and clinical condition deteriorated and the dog had to be euthanized.","1193":"The clinical, echocardiographical and pathomorphological findings of cows with either cardiomyopathy, endocarditis valvularis thromboticans and pericarditis traumatica are described. Based on these examples the use of echocardiography for improved diagnosis is presented.","1194":"Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) is a recent ultrasound technique allowing quantification of regional myocardial function by measurement of myocardial velocities throughout the cardiac cycle. The physical principle of TDI is based on the ability of ultrasound machines to selectively display the low velocity--high amplitude Doppler signals from the myocardial walls. Three TDI modes may be used: the pulsed wave mode, the 2D color mode and the color M-mode. Several studies have already shown that TDI is a more sensitive and specific technique than conventional Doppler echocardiography for detecting moderate myocardial alterations in different settings such as hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, ischemia and heart transplant disorders. TDI might therefore be used as an accurate technique for screening cardiomyopathies, and could also represent in the next future a useful tool for evaluating the efficacy of early cardiac therapeutic interventions.","1195":"The therapeutic possibilities in veterinary cardiology have developed rapidly in the past few years. Whereas until recently cardiac intervention in dogs could only be performed by thoracotomy, new minimally invasive techniques are adopted. Procedures like balloondilatation of pulmonic stenosis, coil embolisation of patent ductus arteriosus, pacemaker implantation in symptomatic bradyarrhyhtmia, and palliative balloon pericardiotomy are becoming more and more established. These alternative interventional methods are attractive, because no postsurgical pain and no complications potentially associated with thoracotomy ensue. The knowledge of such new treatment modalities and particularly the indications for an intervention are prerequisites to apply them optimally and broadly.","1196":"This report describes the case of a 15-month-old alpaca stallion with an open fracture of metatarsus (MT) III\/IV that occurred during transportation. Despite of a guarded prognosis, the animal was operated on request of the owner. The surgical intervention consisted of meticulous lavage and curettage of the wound and affected bone, precise fracture reduction, internal fixation with a 12-hole broad 3.5 mm DCP and implantation of a gentamicin impregnated collagen sponge. Primary wound healing was evident and the implant was removed at 3 months after the initial intervention. At 14 months after surgery, the stallion did not show any signs of lameness and was used for service.","1197":"Three American Staffordshire Terriers were presented with gait abnormalities and loss of balance at the age of 4.5 (female) and 6 years (2 males). The onset varied between 3 and 5 years of age and the clinical signs were slowly progressive. The neurological examination revealed symmetrical generalized cerebellar ataxia with hypermetria, stiffness, and loss of balance with no evidence of paresis. The menace reflex was decreased in one dog and absent in another. A positional nystagmus was found in two dogs. The dogs were euthanized and a histopathological examination of each brain was performed. Pathological changes were confined to the cerebellum. The main finding was loss of Purkinje cells, as well as depletion of granular cell bodies and shrinkage of the granular and molecular cell layer. These findings are consistent with cerebellar cortical abiotrophy. A genetic basis is supposed, but the mode of inheritance is not determined yet. In contrast to some spinocerebellar ataxias in humans, the cause of Purkinje cell degeneration in cerebellar cortical abiotrophy of dogs is not known.","1198":"Fever is not considered a typical clinical sign in animals with portosystemic vascular anomalies (PSVA). In a time period of 8 years, PSVA was diagnosed in 23 cases (20 dogs, 3 cats) at the Animal Hospital of the University of Zurich. Of these, recurrent fever was the only, the predominant or an early sign in 5 animals. Fever and associated unspecific clinical signs like lethargy, inappetence, and reluctance to move were present for weeks to months before the final diagnosis of PSVA was made. It was the lack of typical and well-known signs of PSVA that obscured and delayed the diagnosis. Therefore, PSVA should be included in the differential diagnosis of animals with fever of unknown origin (FUO).","1199":"In Switzerland between 35,000 and 50,000 farm calves per year are fed rations containing concentrated whey. If the ration is balanced, whey has no adverse effects on health and growth rates of calves. Feeding whey to farm animals makes ecological and economical sense and constitutes a sound management for the disposal of milk by-products. The described case consisted of 53 calves of which 7 (13.2%) died within the feedlot-period. Based on clinical and management findings, salt-intoxication was diagnosed because of deprivation of free access to water. When large amounts of hypertonic feed containing low quality whey are fed to calves, their health is adversely affected. Therefore, article 16 of the Swiss Animal Protection Regulation should be changed.","1200":"","1201":"","1202":"This work describes findings in a fattened calf, which were seen in a routine slaughter. The most important findings by the meat inspector were diffuse, black spots between 2 and 70 mm in diameter. This hyperpigmentation was observed on the entire carcass as well as on the outside and inside of all internal organs. Removal of the spinal cord produced black colored liquor. Subsequent microbiological examination of the meat resulted in sterile findings. The muscle pH was 5.8. On histological examination many macrophages containing melanin were found in the lung and liver. Based on these findings the diagnosis of Melanosis maculosa was made.","1203":"The aims of this project were to determine mortality rate and aetiology of losses in suckling rabbits during the first 14 days of life. Post-mortem examinations were done on 1096 siblings from 8 conventional farms. Mortality rates varied from 0 to 17.0%. Main death causes were non-infectious and included stillbirth (13.9%), weakness due to reduced birth weight (3.0%), starvation (11.6%), runting (11.6%), cannibalism (0.5%) and scattering (7.9%). The last four causes mainly attributed to insufficient nursing by the doe. Only 21.8% of the losses were of infectious aetiology.","1204":"In 31 healthy cats urine samples were taken to determine the cortisol\/creatinine ratio (UCC) during hospitalisation and at home. The UCC of the samples, which had been taken in the clinic, was significantly higher (0-19 x 10(-6), Median 3 x 10(-6)) than the one of the samples taken at home (0-4 x 10(-6), Median 1 x 10(-6)). The parameter was neither influenced by the cat's age, sex or the fact that the cat stayed inside or outside, nor by the degree of visible agitation. Assay validation achieved good results regarding precision and accuracy of the measuring of cortisol and creatinine in the urine. The study shows that stress--caused by the visit to the veterinarian--can provoke a significant increase of UCC. Therefore, the parameter should be determined only from urine samples taken at home. Furthermore, it is important to notice that cortisol metabolites are measured in varying degree with the different assays. Therefore, it is inevitable that each laboratory generates its own reference values.","1205":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging disease, which was first recognized in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. In the meantime, SARS has been recognized in patients on all five continents. A novel coronavirus, which is not related to the hitherto known coronaviruses, has been proven to be associated with the disease. Our genomic analyses strongly suggest that the new SARS-coronavirus did not emerge through mutation or recombination and that it has probably been transmitted from a so far not identified animal species to humans. Therefore, it is most likely that SARS virus is a zoonotic agent. A broad body of knowledge originating from research in veterinary medicine indicates that development of vaccines against the SARS-coronavirus may be problematic. The potential danger of such vaccines should not be neglected during the process of vaccine development.","1206":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a GnRH-vaccine in the ram lamb. Experiments were performed using 20 male lambs, randomly divided into a test (GnRH-immunization) and control group (physiological NaCl-solution). At a body weight of 20 kg (age 2-3 months) and three weeks later, all animals of the test group received 2 ml of Improvac (CSL Limited, Parkville, Victoria, Australia). The body weight as well as the blood testosterone concentration were measured weekly for 16 weeks. Thereafter, blood samples for testosterone analysis were taken monthly in immunized lams only. After the booster injection testicular growth was suppressed and plasma testosterone remained at low values &lt; 0.1 ng\/ml for at least 12 weeks. The mean corresponding testosterone concentrations for the control lambs ranged between 0.1 and 0.9 ng\/ml plasma. An increase of testosterone was observed in 8 of 10 immunized animals between 3 to 7 months after the booster dose. The control lambs showed a tendency for better growth rate than vaccinated animals, but the difference was not significant. Our results demonstrate that in prepubertal ram lambs two immunizations with Improvac, three weeks apart, can suppress testosterone secretion and testicular growth at least for three months after the booster injection. For a suppression of reproductive function longer than three months after the second vaccination, a third immunization is needed at this time or when testicular growth is beginning.","1207":"Since September 2001, castration of male calves in Switzerland is not allowed without anesthesia. The use of rubber rings for this purpose is forbidden. It was the goal of this study to describe the effect of a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, administered additionally to sedation and local anesthesia, in clamp-castrated (Burdizzo) calves of 110 to 160 kg of body weight. Plasma fibrinogen concentration, white blood cell count, serum cortisol concentration, scrotal swelling, concentrate intake and weight gain were evaluated. A positive effect after administration of a NSAID was obvious for the serum cortisol concentration, the concentrate intake within the first 3 days after castration and scrotal swelling.","1208":"According to the Swiss Federal law on animal protection and welfare, painful manipulations in animals have to be performed by a veterinarian under local or general anaesthesia, except for some specifically listed surgical interventions (article 65 of the by-law on animal protection). On September 1, 2001, castration of calves and lambs has been deleted from this list of exceptions. Since then, several pressure groups have requested these interventions to be delegated to the producers for economical reasons. The current article describes the results of a web-based survey on this subject, conducted among the members of the Swiss Association of ruminant practitioners (SARP). Two separate questionnaires--one focused on calves and one on lambs--were made available to the members of the SARP for a duration of 3 months as pdf-files on the homepage of the SARP (www.svwasmr.ch). On December 31, 2002, the deadline for submission of the completed questionnaires, the membership of the SARP was constituted of 360 practicing veterinarians. The response rate was 25%. Close to a hundred percents of the responding veterinarians expressed the expectation that the SARP publish guidelines on the castration of calves and lambs. An overwhelming majority refused the delegation of castrations to the producers, and further stated that they were not ready to accept any responsibility for interventions performed by the producers. However, a third of the responding veterinarians judged the expected workload for the castration of lambs to presumably exceed their current capacity. It is concluded from the results of this survey that the board of the SARP should urgently elaborate, discuss, and propose novel and innovative concepts to solve the issue of castration of calves and lambs.","1209":"Surgical interventions in cattle are frequently performed under local analgesia. Local analgesia may be carried out in the standing animal without or with slight sedation or with the animal in recumbency after deep sedation. Injection of local analgesics is less time consuming than induction and maintenance of general analgesia and is, therefore, frequently used in private veterinary practice. Precise anatomical knowledge of the nerve supply to the area to be operated is a prerequisite for the successful introduction of a local analgesia. The goal of the present review is to summarize nerve supply and indications for surgery in the area of the head, male genital tract, teat and the claws of the hind limb of cattle.","1210":"A special staining technique for the middle piece of sperms is described in different species (cow, horse, sheep, goat, pig). Staining was performed with frozen or fresh semen. The mitochondria in the middle piece could not always be stained with the same intensity. Using 600-fold magnification, subunits of the middle-piece could be observed, but only on fresh collected and immediately stained sperms. When kept in the refrigerator for more than 3 days, the observed subunits disappeared. A positive correlation between staining intensity and enzyme activity could be indicative for sperm motility and also fertilizing capacity.","1211":"An open multi-centered veterinary clinical trial, comparing conditions before and after treatment with a herbal preparation, containing the powdered root of Echinacea purpurea, was conducted by 6 practicing veterinarians in Switzerland. The plant-based immune stimulant was administered to 41 dogs with manifestations of chronic and seasonal upper respiratory tract infections, including pharyngitis\/tonsillitis, bronchitis and kennel cough. Each animal was at an individual stage of the disease, with various symptoms and different severity scores, at start of treatment. There was no control group. Echinacea powder (1:3) was administered with the food at a dose of 1.0 g\/10 kg body weight once daily for 8 weeks. Overall efficacy showed significant improvement for 92% of 39 dogs after 4 weeks of treatment and this was confirmed after 8 weeks. Significant reductions of severity and resolution of typical clinical symptoms, of clear nasal secretions, enlargement of lymph nodes, dry cough, dyspnea and dry lung sounds, were evident after 4 weeks. Only two adverse effects, not suspected to be attributable to the study drug, were recorded. Because quality and stability of the Echinacea powder were defined, using an analytical standard and purity tests, these data suggest, that the Echinacea preparation can be recommended as a well tolerated alternative treatment of canine upper respiratory tract infections.","1212":"The most commonly encountered chronic enteropathies in dogs are inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), food allergies, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Recent research in the field of immunopathogenesis of IBD and food allergy in human beings have made available new therapeutic options with immunomodulatory drugs. However, the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of canine IBD and food allergy have not been elucidated so far. Further studies focusing on the immunological dysregulation in the mucosa as well as clinical trials with new therapeutic modalities are needed to improve our knowledge and approach to these chronic diseases in dogs.","1213":"Extrahepatic biliary tract rupture only rarely occur secondary to blunt or sharp trauma to the abdomen. Clinical symptoms result from chemical peritonitis and are unspecific. Recognition most often is delayed from several days to weeks, when patients suffer from ascites, icterus, dehydration and apathy. Surgical therapy depends of the site of laceration. In the present case, a dog with bile peritonitis was presented two weeks after being hit by a car. Explorative celiotomy revealed a rupture of the common bile duct. A cholecystojejunostomy was performed.","1214":"On the basis of meat inspection in an abattoir in the eastern part of Switzerland, the incidence of liverflukes in cattle was recorded weekly during one year. The prevalence was compared with surveys from the seventies and nineties. The average incidence of Dicrocoelium dendriticum infection did not change. Although the prevalence of Fasciola hepatica apparently slightly decreased, an actual decrease of liverflukes could not be demonstrated.","1215":"The goal of this study was to describe the findings in four cows with non-magnetic reticular foreign bodies composed of copper. The cows were referred to our clinic because of reduced appetite and a marked decrease in milk production. Based on the clinical findings, a tentative diagnosis of traumatic reticuloperitonitis was made in all cows. The reticulum of all cows was then examined ultrasonographically and radiographically. In all cows, radiographs of the reticulum showed wire-shaped foreign bodies, ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, which appeared to have penetrated the reticular wall. Two cows (No. 3, 4) had a magnet in the reticulum close to the foreign body but there was no direct contact between the two. A magnet was administered to cows No. 1 and 2, and radiography of the reticulum was performed for a second time the following day. The magnets were observed in the reticulum; however, they did not contact the foreign bodies. Because all the magnets were correctly placed in the reticulum yet, despite close proximity, did not contact the foreign bodies, the latter were thought to be non-magnetic. Cow No. 1 was slaughtered. Left flank laparoruminotomy was performed in the remaining three cows. In all cows, copper foreign bodies ranging in length from 3.0 to 7.0 cm, were found in the reticulum. They had penetrated the reticular wall and were not attached to magnets. The radiographic findings described in the present study are strongly indicative of a non-magnetic foreign body. Ruminotomy is the treatment of choice but slaughter may also be considered.","1216":"Evaluating the possibility of performing a caesarean section on a cow with dystocia, the economic value of the animal usually plays a central role. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse and to determine possible factors influencing the fertility. In 1998, 1999 and the first half-year of 2000 a total of 207 cows had a caesarean section. 68% of the inseminated cows which gave birth to a living calf became pregnant again, whereas only 46% of the cows with a dead calf were successfully reinseminated. Thus, 59% of all inseminated cows became pregnant, 2.5% of them had an abortion. The occurrence of retained fetal membranes or of endometritis has been shown to have negative effects on fertility. Only 30% of subsequent inseminations were successful in cows which had suffered from endometritis. The probability of being affected by endometritis was twice as high after birth of a dead calf than after a living calf.","1217":"During the years of 1996-2001, hypothyroidism was diagnosed at the clinic for small animal internal medicine, University of Zurich, in 32 dogs. Most of the dogs were large breeds. The most frequent clinical characteristics observed were exercise intolerance, obesity, dermatological, neurological and gastrointestinal signs. Predominant laboratory abnormalities were a low red blood cell count, increased concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides and fructosamin. 29 dogs had a T4 below the reference range (&lt; 1.5 micrograms\/dl), one dog had a T4 at the lower limit thereof (1.6 micrograms\/dl). One dog had a T4 within the reference range (3.4 micrograms\/dl), another had a very high T4 of 206.8 micrograms\/dl; the results of the latter 2 dogs were interpreted as incorrectly increased T4 values due to in vitro interference with T4-autoantibodies. Diagnosis was confirmed in all of the dogs based on TSH-stimulation testing. Endogenous TSH (cTSH) measured parallelly, was elevated in only 60% of the dogs. In about 67% of the dogs, hypothyroidism was associated with thyroglobulin-autoantibodies. Canine hypothyroidism is a rather rare endocrine disorder in Switzerland. The TSH-stimulation test remains the gold standard in confirming the disease; a definitive diagnosis can be challenging for practitioners because bovine TSH, used for the TSH-stimulation test is not licensed for use in dogs. Since assessment of cTSH using current assays shows normal values in a high percentage of hypothyroid dogs, the diagnostic value is only limited. In most of the hypothyroid dogs T4 is decreased, with the presence of autoantibodies to T4, it can be normal or increased.","1218":null,"1219":"The purpose of this paper was to describe the clinical findings in four cattle with abscesses in the cervical vertebrae. In all of the animals there was generalized ataxia and normal behaviour, mentation and cranial nerve function. All animals had marked difficulty rising and had generalized ataxia. The most important haematological and biochemical findings were a mildly increased concentration of plasma protein in all animals and a markedly increased fibrinogen concentration in two animals. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from three animals. The protein content was mildly increased in the CSF samples of two animals. Based on the clinical findings, a tentative diagnosis of central nervous system disease with localisation in the neck region was made in all of the animals. Due to a poor prognosis, all of the animals were slaughtered. Postmortem examination revealed abscesses in the region of C3 to C6, which had resulted in extramedullary compression of the spinal cord. The abscesses varied in diameter from 2 to 8 cm.","1220":"The protozoan parasite Neospora caninum is one of the most important infectious abortion causes in cattle worldwide. In a Swiss case-control-study we investigated 113 abortion problem farms and 113 control farms. It was possible to detect N. caninum in 21% of 242 investigated aborted fetuses by PCR upon brain samples. Eighty-four % of mothers aborting N. caninum positive fetuses were serologically positive for this parasite. The seroprevalence for N. caninum of all aborting mothers was 44%. Within a period of 3 to 12 months 4,505 cattle from the participating farms were investigated serologically at two different time points. Strong fluctuations of the specific antibody concentration could be observed, resulting in a conversion to seronegativity in the second blood sample in 39% of formerly seropositive animals. Eighteen months after the end of the study, 42 case- and 42 controlfarms were questioned about their present abortion-status. Analysis of the questionnaire revealed that 80% of the former abortion problem farms observed an improvement of the situation. However, in 43% of those farms no preventive measures had been taken and no significant differences in hygiene, forage and animal turnover could be observed between case- and control-farms. Additionally, no significant differences were detected concerning risk factors such as the presence of farm dogs and the disposal procedure for placental and fetal material.","1221":"Microdissection of chromosomes and subsequent amplification of the DNA material by PCR allow the development of libraries, region-specific DNA probes or chromosome painting probes. Veterinary medicine will benefit from this method in instances where clarification of numercal or structural chromosome aberrations is needed.","1222":"","1223":"Abortion cases of 144 goats und 86 sheep were investigated etiologically during 2 lambing seasons (1996\/1997, 1997\/1998). Macroscopic inspection of fetus and placenta was completed by histopathology and bacteriological isolation of agents. In addition, immunohistologically the following antigens were labeled in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections: Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Chlamydophila abortus (formerly Chlamydia psittaci serovar 1) and Border Disease Virus. From farms with abortions caused by Chlamydophila abortus specific data were recorded. In 75% of abortion cases in sheep and in 59% of cases in goats an etiologic diagnosis could be substantiated. Chlamydophila abortus is the most commonly involved agent in the etiology of caprine and ovine abortion (sheep 39%, goats 23%), followed by Toxoplasma gondii (sheep 19%, goats 15%) and Coxiella burnetti (sheep 1%, goats 10%). All other agents are of minor importance. An infectious cause of abortion based on histopathologic findings without isolation of agents was observed in sheep (10%) and goats (21%). Malformation occurred in sheep (2%) and goats (3%) and lesions suggestive for Vitamin E\/Selenium deficiency were seen in goats only (2%).","1224":null,"1225":"A case of bovine abortion was for the first time in Switzerland diagnosed by immunohistochemistry PCR (16S rRNA, ompA) and gene sequence analysis to be caused by Chlamydia psittaci. A possible occurence of further cases has to be investigated. Based on the existence of several methods with very different sensitivity and specificity to diagnose chlamydia it is suggested that at least two verified diagnostic tools should be used to diagnose an involvement of chlamydia in bovine abortion.","1226":"On a farm housing cattle and goats an abortion storm occurred affecting 50% of the goats during the lambing season 2000\/2001. In one of three investigated caprine abortions Chlamydophila abortus could be identified as etiology. During this time a pregnant woman (pregnancy week 19\/20) had contact with aborting goats. She developed a severe generalized infection and aborted. The placenta contained Chlamydophila abortus shown by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Aim of the present case report is to alert veterinarians about the potential zoonotic risk of ovine\/caprine abortions.","1227":"","1228":"Palliative radiation therapy may provide significant relief in symptoms in pets with incurable cancer. Therapy is applied over a short period of time, using larger than normal fractional doses. Palliative radiation leads to minimal or no side effects. This case report describes the situation of a miniature poodle that was presented with severe dyschezia as well as fresh blood in the feces. The dog had a large abdominal mass which was diagnosed as lymph-node metastasis of a perianal gland carcinoma. Therapy included palliative radiation as well as chemotherapy. Six months after initial presentation the dog is free of clinical symptoms.","1229":"In a dog presenting with the clinical signs of exercise intolerance and ascites, cardiac tamponade due to suspected idiopathic pericarditis was diagnosed based on thoracic radiographs, electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac ultrasound. Pericardial effusion recurred soon after pericardiocenteses, prescription of colchizine and again after balloon pericardiotomy. After partial pericardectomy by thoracoscopy and after obtaining a histological diagnosis of mesothelioma adjuvant intracavitary chemotherapy using cisplatin was performed. Already one week later the dog developed marked dyspnea due to severe pleural effusion. The dog was maintained at acceptable life quality judged based on playfulness and appetite using repeated pleuro-centeses for an additional two months, when the dog was euthanized due to uncontrollable pleural effusion. Despite extensive treatments life span from initial presentation to euthanasia was only 5 months. Necropsy revealed extensive mesothelioma metastases covering the whole pleura, epicardium and remaining pericardium. Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of (recurrent) pericardial effusion are discussed based on this case.","1230":"In routine mastitis diagnostic S. aureus strains are often identified using DNAse reaction. However, this enzyme activity is not limited only to S. aureus strains. Furthermore, the strength of the DNAse reaction between different strains varies strongly. These factors lead to the fact that the results are often not comparable between laboratories. The aim of these investigations was to validate the DNAse reaction for routine identification of S. aureus in mastitis diagnostic and to set a critical limit for interpretation of DNAse reaction. The results of 189 strains isolated from bovine mastitis milk samples show that colonies with beta delta or delta-haemolysis and DNAse reactions of &gt; or = 2 mm can reliably be identified (sensitivity 91.2%, specificity 96.9%) as S. aureus.","1231":"The Delvo-P-test (Gist-brocades nr, Delft, The Netherlands) is based on biological detection of antibiotics in the milk. According to the procedure of the manufacture the test is suited for bulk milk processing factories. Problems arise when the test is used on milk samples of a single cow. Buffers, cells, bacteria, cell contents, and desinfection without using antibiotics may give false positive and false negative results. An error up to 44.8% was detected on single cow milk samples. The test is well suited for bulk milk, where the processing of milk follows a biological procedure as for cheese. The use on single cow milk samples to prove absence of antibiotics is not recommended.","1232":"For the first time Ovine Herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) was identified in Swiss pigs as the causative agent of Porcine Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF). Diseased animals from two farms were observed to show weakness, anorexia, fever up to 41 degrees C, and neurological symptoms, i.e. ataxia, convulsions and hyperesthesia, erosion on the snout and in the oral and nasal mucosa, as well as multiple skin lesions. Histopathological findings included severe non-purulent inflammation with mononuclear cell infiltration in several organs. Most dominant were meningo-encephalitis, disseminated nephritis as well as purulent catarrhalic bronchopneumonia. The findings were quite reminiscent of the lesions due to MCF in cattle and give therefore substantial proof to use Porcine Malignant Catarrhal Fever as the term for the disease. Identification of the causative agent was done with a quantitative PCR specific for OvHV-2. Different tissues from diseased animals were positive. Furthermore, one animal which had been ill for more than five days tested positive for antibodies against an epitope conserved among MCF viruses. Serum samples from diseased animals reacted negative towards Classical Swine Fever- and Pseudorabies virus antigen. A weakly positive reaction against porcine enterovirus type I argued against the involvement of enteroviruses in the observed disease. Moreover, by means of different conventional PCRs, we detected the newly discovered porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses for the first time in Switzerland and could at the same time exclude their involvement in Porcine Malignant Catarrhal Fever.","1233":"When the first BSE case in Switzerland became public in 1990, it precipitated a chain of events with many diverse consequences. During this time, we continued to gain knowledge, implement new measures, and make practical recommendations in order to attempt to control the disease. This was made possible by the establishment of a huge data base containing information on all cases of BSE that had been diagnosed in Switzerland, as well as by the use of information from experiences in other countries. Analysis of these data allowed the sequence of events to be described temporally and spatially and an epidemiological evaluation to be made. These data also allow predictions to be made regarding the future of BSE in Switzerland, although these predictions must be interpreted cautiously.","1234":"For a long time, BSE was considered a problem of the UK exclusively. Even after the detection of BSE cases in countries outside the UK, the risk of having BSE was categorically denied by many other countries. Only after the introduction of active surveillance did several \"BSE free\" countries detect BSE in their country. However, before the detection of the first cases in several of these countries, a risk assessment (GBR) conducted by the Scientific Steering Committee of the EU showed that a risk could be present. There remain many countries with an unknown BSE risk. In order to minimise import risks from these countries, further risk assessment is needed to evaluate the real BSE distribution worldwide.","1235":"Visual evaluation of the occurrence of BAB (born after ban) cases pointed towards spatial clustering. Therefore a statistical analysis of spatial case clustering was conducted using GIS technology. In the initial analysis, all 376 cases (135 BAB, 241 BBB\/born before ban) diagnosed through mid of March 2001 were investigated using the spatial scan statistic. Two clusters of BBB cases were identified in the western part of Switzerland, and two clusters of BAB cases in the eastern part. Epidemiological investigations performed within the BAB clusters showed an increased pig density in these cluster regions. Pig density is considered an indicator for the probability of contamination of cattle feed with feed containing meat-and-bone meal that is intended for other species (cross-contamination). In an updated cluster analysis including all cases reported until end of June 2002 (data set B), clusters were identified in the same regions as previously. It was shown that the BAB clusters occurred in different time periods. The small scale differences in cluster size and location are discussed, with an emphasis on the implications for following epidemiological investigations.","1236":"The eradication of BSE is proving to be a lengthy task. Undisputedly, it has become one of the highest priority tasks of the Veterinary Services in Europe since the disease first occurred in the mid eighties. However, the effects of the ongoing eradication effort also impair important economic agricultural sectors. Risk analysis has never before been such a critical tool in the decision-making processes for eradication of animal diseases, despite the problem that many risk analyses are being conducted in the face of incomplete knowledge about BSE. In the focus are the measures minimizing the risk for humans (such as the ban on specified risk material) and the measures implemented to prevent the spread of the disease in animals with the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to ruminants. Due to the long incubation period, implementation of insufficient measures may not be noticed for many years. Implementation of drastic measures is needed, if the eradication of the disease is to be pursued purposefully.","1237":"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are dementing diseases and have been known to affect humans for over 90 years. The most common of these is the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), followed by its familial (fCJD) and an iatrogenic (iCJD) form. 1996 a variant of CJD (vCJD) has been described in the UK, of which so far 131 cases have been observed worldwide. Specific biochemical and neuropathological signatures allow to distinguish between vCJD and sCJD and lead to the hypothesis that vCJD is due to transmission of BSE prions to humans. Although promising therapeutical approaches are being investigated, human TSE remain untreatable entities. Thus preventive measures are essential. In Switzerland the population has been exposed to BSE prions, too, but no case of vCJD as described in the UK has been observed until now. Since 2001, however, a so far unexplained increase of sCJD cases is being observed.","1238":"Scrapie has been known to occur in sheep and goats for over 250 years. Sheep and goats can be experimentally infected orally with BSE, however BSE infection can only be distinguished from scrapie using costly and extensive laboratory procedures. An overview of both the current state of knowledge on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) in small ruminants as well as the TSE monitoring and control strategies in place in Switzerland is presented.","1239":"There are several other diseases besides BSE which belong to the group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Although most mammals can be experimentally infected with the agent of these diseases, generally only single representatives of the orders Artiodactyla (cloven-hoofed animals), Carnivora (carnivores) and Primates (humans and monkeys) are naturally infected in the field. An overview of the current state of knowledge on TSE in several species like exotic ruminants, deer, mink and cats is presented. Etiological, clinical, anatomic-pathological and epidemiological aspects are described.","1240":"A method is presented by which a maximal number of BSE-infected cattle that had escaped the filter of clinical examination are identified during ante mortem examination. This approach might prove to be an efficient and cost-effective method for veterinary and non-veterinary meat inspectors to remove infected animals prior to slaughter. In a case-control study, the clinical signs of 224 randomly selected sick slaughtered animals were compared with the clinical signs of 26 sick slaughtered animals in which BSE infection was diagnosed using a rapid test post mortem. In addition, the clinical signs of the sick slaughtered BSE-positive animals were compared with the clinical signs of a group of BSE suspects identified during the same time period and in which BSE infection could be confirmed. As a result of this study a mathematical model was developed to identify BSE suspects. This model contains a total of 7 variables (clinical signs) that proved to be of importance. These signs were aggressive behaviour, grinding of teeth, protruding eyeballs, reduced rumination, inability to stand, overexcitability, and difficulty in standing up. The presented model has a sensitivity of 61.5% (16 out of 26 BSE-positive animals slaughtered while sick were identified) and a specificity of 99.6% when compared to a rapid test conducted post mortem.","1241":"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle is characterised by typical signs and an insidious course. There is gradual weight loss and decreased milk production, and the disease is distinguished by disturbances in behaviour, sensitivity and locomotion. The most common behavioural changes are apprehension and abnormal temperament. The most common changes in sensitivity are hypersensitivity to tactile, auditory and optical stimuli, kicking during milking and excessive licking of the muzzle. The most important disturbances in locomotion include ataxia, falling down and inability to get up. Diagnostic procedures include a thorough clinical and neurological examination followed by a more detailed examination to assess behaviour, locomotion and sensitivity to touch, sound and light stimuli. Other causes of central nervous system disease may be ruled out by a complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis and examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Disturbances in behaviour, locomotion and sensitivity that occur singly, rather than in combination with each other, should be interpreted with caution. However, in cattle with disturbances in two or more of these categories, a tentative diagnosis of BSE can be made, and the veterinary authorities must be notified.","1242":"Histopathological examination of the central nervous system is essential for the confirmation of a TSE diagnosis. Typical lesions are spongiform changes of the grey matter, intraneuronal vacuoles in particular nuclei of the brain stem, gliosis and neuronal degeneration. The nature of the lesions is similar between species. However, the variation in the distribution and severity of the changes is striking. Even more reliable than histopathology is the detection of disease-specific protease-resistant prion protein (PrPSc) using immunohistochemistry. The so-called \"rapid tests\" allow detection of PrPSc in unfixed tissues and are mostly used for the screening of risk populations and slaughtered animals.","1243":"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS) occurring in a variety of species. The causative agent is thought to be composed of an abnormal form of the host encoded prion protein (PrPC), termed PrPSc. The conformational change of PrPC into PrPSc can occur spontaneously, however, it can also be induced by PrPSc. Prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease (vCJD) are most likely caused by peripheral uptake of prions. The process by which prions proceed to the CNS following peripheral uptake is referred to as neuroinvasion. Infection with prions is thought to occur in two phases: After ingestion prions first replicate in lymphatic tissue and then gain access to the CNS via peripheral nerves. Studies looking at the biochemical and clinical characteristics of BSE and vCJD demonstrated that BSE is most likely responsible for vCJD in humans.","1244":"The development of Veterinary Medicine in the Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany and the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) is sketched in highlights. After the collectivization of agriculture (1960) a centralistically controlled national veterinary system was established. It was suited to the requirements of the industrially organized animal production. The successive classification of socialistic veterinary administration was associated with the following matters: the extension of veterinary subject matters, a vertical division of work with the aid of newly created technical veterinary professions, and a penetration of the profession with political guidelines. As the professional level of the veterinary system in the GDR was relatively high the reflection in retrospective needs to be evaluated in a differentiated way considering the textual and social conditions. In spite of centralism and indoctrination the veterinary system remained professionally autonomous with islands of political independence, which sustained the identity of this profession. The latter formed the base for self renewal of the East German veterinary system at the end of the socialistic area 1989\/1990.","1245":"","1246":"","1247":"The knowledge of anthrax as a disease and its importance as a zoonosis in the Greco-Roman world is revealed through a selection of classical texts and mythological sources, taking into account evidence of reworking and reuse of these texts up until the nineteenth century. The numerous names given to the disease throughout history and their linguistic origins will also be examined in this paper. The narrative of the epizoonoses in Noricum in Virgil's Georgics; taken by several to represent a description of an anthrax epidemic, and which had a great influence in written works on veterinary medicine up until the discovery of bacteria, will be given particular attention. The crucial term is \"Sacer Ignis\", synonymous for several different human and animal diseases through time. This term will be analysed in terms of linguistic origin and the changes in meaning it acquired throughout the centuries.","1248":"Pet birds are frequently viewed as difficult patients for anaesthesia. The present paper revises the current anaesthetic procedures for injectable and inhalant anaesthetics. Currently the method of choice for the anaesthesia of pet birds is the isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia. Special emphasis is given to the preanaesthetic preparations. Fasting is shorter for pet birds than for mammals. Anaesthetized birds are at special risk for hypothermia. Methods for the prevention of heat loss are given. The use of analgesics are recommended both for welfare reasons but also because of the possibility to reduce the concentration of inhalation anaesthetics and therefore the amount of possible exposure of personnel to waste gases.","1249":"","1250":"In today's society small rodents and rabbits are increasingly kept as pets. Anaesthesia is necessary for numerous reasons and proves to be a challenge for many veterinarians. Following surgical intervention analgesia is frequently neglected. This article reviews the preparation of small mammals for anaesthesia, the choice of anaesthetics and the possibilities of perioperative care including monitoring, complications, fluid therapy and analgesia.","1251":null,"1252":"","1253":"A six-year-old female Birman cat was referred to our clinic because of chronic progressive changes in behavior. Additionally, generalized vestibular ataxia and psychomotor seizures were noticed. A multifocal lesion in the forebrain as well as brainstem was suspected. Ancillary investigations such as complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis and cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed no significant abnormalities. Electroencephalography showed diffuse changes in the cortical activity. Feline spongiform encephalopathy was confirmed by histological brain examination and positive immunohistochemistry for PrPSc. This is the first time that a case of feline spongiform encephalopathy is diagnosed in Switzerland.","1254":"The copper and zinc contents of 25 rations for adult horses were evaluated. The total amount of copper and zinc daily ingested was obtained by adding the amount of each element contained and added of the commercial feed to the amount contained in ingested hay and oats. The total amount of copper and zinc ingested daily was compared with the official recommendations for the maintenance of an adult horse of 550 kg. The results show that a traditional ration oats\/hay does not contain a sufficient amount of copper and zinc in order to cover their respective requirements. Furthermore, many rations which include commercial feed also do not cover the requirements of these two elements. The importance of these observations is discussed in the light of the eventual need to complete the rations.","1255":"Free trade with animals and animal products requires transparency concerning health information of animal populations. On the basis of the bilateral agreement with the European Union (EU), Switzerland is obliged to document freedom from Aujeszky's disease (AD) in its pig population by conducting surveys on a regular basis. Such a survey was planned for the first time for the year 2001. In this context, it was evaluated whether additional pig diseases should be included in the survey. This article describes the evaluation procedure for the selection of pig diseases integrated in the survey 2001. Additionally, it reports and interprets the results of this survey. All of the 2537 farms and 41,719 blood samples were tested negative. Therefore, it could be documented with a confidence of 99.98% that the AD-prevalence in Switzerland is below 1%.","1256":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of two Swiss animal welfare friendly housing programs, 'regular access to outdoor facilities' (RAUS) and 'improved loose housing systems' (BTS) on health and welfare of dairy cows. During two years, the following indicators of health and welfare were observed on 136 randomly selected dairy farms: injuries around the joints, callosities, lameness, teat injuries, cleanliness, behaviour during lying and rising, body condition score, and incidence of medical treatments. Farms participating in both housing programs (BTS + RAUS) and farms with the program RAUS were compared to traditional farms that did not participate in a program. Housing system and management practice were recorded as additional factors influencing health and welfare of cows. Cows on farms participating in BTS + RAUS had, on average, fewer injuries around the hocks and fewer callosities at the carpal joints than cows in farms which did not participate in a housing program. Lameness was most frequent in cows of farms without housing program, followed by cows in tie stalls with the program RAUS and cows in loose housing systems with BTS + RAUS. There were fewer antibiotic treatments in farms with BTS + RAUS compared to the other farms.","1257":"","1258":"This report describes border disease in a flock of sheep in Switzerland. In April 2001, three ewes in a flock of 41 sheep gave birth to lambs that had generalized tremors and excessively hairy fleece. One of these, a three-week-old female lamb, was referred to our clinic for further diagnostic work-up. The lamb was very nervous, bleated constantly and had generalized muscle tremors, which were more pronounced in the head region. Hind end ataxia was observed, and the lamb was slow to correct its posture when the hind limbs were abducted, adducted or crossed. Blood samples were collected every six weeks to determine antibody titres to pestivirus and for virus isolation via cell culture. A skin biopsy sample was also collected and examined immunohistochemically for pestivirus antigen. Antibody titres in the first tests were suspicious and those of the second were negative. Pestivirus was identified in cell culture, and the skin biopsy sample was positive for pestivirus antigen. Blood samples were collected from all of the ewes and lambs and the buck for virus isolation via cell culture and determination of pestivirus antibody titres. Thirty-one animals were seropositive, six had borderline antibody titres and four were seronegative. Pestivirus was isolated from eight animals, which included the lamb described in this report. Of the virus-positive animals, three were seronegative, three others had borderline titres and two were seropositive. Six of the eight viruses isolated from cell culture were further characterized genetically via retrotranscription and polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the causative agent was border disease virus. This is the first time that border disease virus has been isolated in Switzerland. The lamb referred to our clinic was observed for three months; it was then euthanatised and a postmortem examination was performed. Immunohistochemical examination of numerous organs revealed pestivirus antigen. The source of infection was though to be infected sheep from another flock, which shared a pasture. All antigen-positive animals were slaughtered.","1259":"A population of Baudet du Poitou donkeys was genetically characterized using microsatellites. The results were used to verify the pedigrees and to estimate the genetic variability. It could be confirmed that a equine parentage test kit works well for donkeys and that by using 13 microsatellites more than 99% of wrong pedigree informations would be detected. The genetic variability was comparable to a representative group of Baudet du Poitou donkeys in France.","1260":"Coat color played an important role during domestication and formation of breeds. Livestock breeders often had special preferences for particular color phenotypes because they believed them to be associated with performance or fitness traits. Socio-cultural reasons might have had an influence on color selection as well. Recently genetic tests on DNA level got available to genotype in any individual horse for basic horse coat colors (chestnut, bay, black). In particular, hidden carriers of the recessive chestnut and black allele are recognizable with these tests. A sample of 162 Franches-Montagnes horses from Switzerland was genotyped for the alleles for chestnut and black. The analysis of allele frequencies revealed a high prevalence of the chestnut allele and a low frequency of the black allele in this population. Rare colors are in demand on the market. The statistical analysis of 1369 offspring from five stallions indicate, that darker shades of basic color phenotypes (dark chestnut, dark bay) follow a recessive mode of inheritance in the Franches-Montagnes horse breed.","1261":"Tick-borne zoonotic pathogens are well known in many areas all over the world. Among the tick-borne transmitted diseases in Switzerland, Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, ehrlichiosis caused by various species of Ehrlichia and tick-borne encephalitis caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are the most important zoonotic diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment is necessary to prevent fatal infections and chronic damage to various tissues. Due to the variety of uncharacteristic clinical signs, tick-borne diseases are not easily recognized. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, a record of tick exposure, and direct or indirect detection of the pathogen. Here we discuss briefly the most important tick-borne infections and their diagnosis with emphasis on a new molecular diagnostic tool--the real-time TaqMan PCR--and its importance for the diagnosis of tick-borne pathogens.","1262":"In the Swiss horse population, the prevalence of conspicuous behaviours (behavioural disorders and stable vices) was recorded with a written questionnaire in a representative survey among 1861 horse yards, and the occurrence of the stereotypic behavioural disorders crib-biting, weaving and boxwalking was analysed with emphasis on their association with horse specific (breed, age, sex) and environmental factors (e.g. housing system, nutrition, management and utilisation). 622 horse yards with a total number of 2536 horses answered to the questionnaire, and conspicuous behaviours were described for 418 horses (16.5%). Thereof, the most common stereotypic behavioural disorders with a potential negative impact on animal welfare, crib-biting, weaving, and\/or boxwalking were named for 89 horses (3.5%). Stable vices (e.g. shying, bucking, aggressivity against humans) were noted for 47 horses (1.9%). For 281 horses (11.1%) conspicuous behaviours such as pawing, lip-liking, head shacking, kicking stall were given; these can be categorised as behavioural disorders or as stable vices depending on their intensity and causation. Data analysis data revealed a number of statistically significant associations between genetic factors (breed), housing, management practices, utilisation and the three stereotypies. The strongest influence on the degree of behavioural disorders had the breed as well as the extent of direct social contact with other horses, free movement on pasture, feeding pattern and regular utilisation.","1263":"In a random population of Swiss horses 54% suffered from a subclinical to moderate COPD. Cause of a COPD is a hypersensitivity of the respiratory tract to spores of fungi and thermophil actinomyces. Teeth problems are strongly associated with the type of diet and the feeding regime. Problems of the teeth belong to the most often treated equine diseases by large animal practitioners. Racehorses are the population of horses most often affected by gastric ulcers with an ulcer prevalence between 63 and 90%. In contrast, a much lower prevalence (37%) of stomach ulcers is seen in pleasure horses and the degree of ulceration is less severe. Large amounts of concentrated high-energy feeds, small rations of forage and a low feeding frequency per day as well as the use of spoiled food can contribute to the development of colics.","1264":"Out of a representative sample of 1861 Swiss horse yards, 622 horse keepers (35.2%) with 2536 horses, ponies and donkeys sent back a questionnaire about general farm characteristics, their horse-specific training, horse stock, housing conditions, intraspecific social contacts, feeding, ability to move freely, use of the horses and management. 83.5% of horses were kept individually (thereof 18.3% tethered, 32.3% in a loose box indoors, 28.4% in a loose box outdoors, and 4.5% in a loose box with permanent access to a paddock or an individual pasture), and 16.5% lived in group housing systems. 36% of the horses had daily access to a pasture, 62.8% depending on the weather, and 1.2% never at all. Individually housed horses pastured significantly less than horses kept in groups. The mean use per week was 4.5 hours, depending on breed, type of use and housing system. Only 50% of the horse keepers were trained with respect to horses or farm animals (e.g. professional training graduation, license, military service, veterinarian, farmer). In Switzerland, horses are still housed and fed in a traditional way, despite considerable recent changes in the amount and type of use (65.1% leisure horses, 34.9% sport and working horses); this may result in health and behavioural problems. Therefore, information and education of horsewomen and horsemen should be emphasized in the future. For the transfer of knowledge, veterinarians are of high importance.","1265":"Over 45 million years of evolution the horse developed to a highly specialized animal in anatomy, physiology and behavior. No other animal had influenced the economic and cultural history of men to such extent. Hunting prey since the ice age, domesticated 4000 B.C. and used for thousands of years as unique animal all over the world has attained a new role today as partner in sport, as companion animal and even as cotherapeutic. The well known behavioral demands in use and keeping are still often not fulfilled.","1266":"","1267":"Reference values for the following parameters were established in the cerebrospinal fluid of 27 calves between four and eight weeks of age: specific weight, protein concentration, erythrocyte count, total leucocyte count with cell differentiation, creatin kinase activity, glucose and sodium. If possible, the findings were compared with those of other authors in calves and adult bovines. With 24.3 cells per microliter the 90% quantile of the total leucocyte count was seated significantly above comparable values for adult bovines. Hence, in individual cases markedly higher leucocyte counts can be expected in the cerebrospinal fluid of calves. In agreement with other authors, the protein concentration in calves was lower than in adult bovines. The reference range for creatin kinase activity was increased whereas the one for sodium was only slightly increased compared to earlier investigations in calves and in adult bovines.","1268":"Investigations were performed on shedding of C. perfringens in sows from four different pig farms. In two farms where no outbreaks of necrotizing enteritis had been observed, no strains of C. perfringens producing beta-toxin were detected in the faeces of sows. In contrast, C. perfringens strains producing beta-toxin were detected in sows on both farms suffering outbreaks of acute necrotizing enteritis. Strains of C. perfringens producing beta-toxin were invariably positive for the beta 2-toxin gene. However, strains carrying the beta 2-toxin gene only (i.e. negative for beta-toxin) were present in animals on all farms with roughly similar frequencies (mean 28.2% carriers). Some sows carried C. perfringens strains of both toxin genotypes simultaneously. Whereas these data further support the role of betatoxin as a cause of necrotizing enteritis, the role of beta 2-toxin in intestinal disease of piglets remains unclear. To establish the role of faecal shedding vs. environmental contamination as reservoirs of C. perfringens type C, strains were isolated from teats and feedlot trough swabs (toxin genotype beta\/beta 2), as well as from fodder (genotype beta 2). However, sows carried this pathogen intermittently and in small numbers. This renders an individual, reliable diagnosis of carrier sows very difficult. Ribotyping of 34 C. perfringens isolates of different toxin genotypes showed five distinct profiles. Different toxin genotypes can belong to the same ribotype, and the same toxin genotype can be present in different ribotypes. Thus, even if a majority (79.4%) of strains investigated in a limited geographic region belonged to ribotype 1, ribotyping offered discrimination of strains beyond toxin typing.","1269":"Necrotizing enteritis in piglets is caused by the spore-forming anaerobe Clostridium perfringens type C. The pathology is believed to be due to the production of beta-toxin by the agent and the infection tends to persist in affected herds despite appropriate hygiene measures. During the period 1989 to 2001, 35 outbreaks were observed in 15 herds in a limited geographic region in northwestern Switzerland in the canton of Fribourg. Initial outbreaks of acute disease were followed by chronic manifestations of necrotizing enteritis in eleven herds. Since clinical symptoms in case of chronic necrotizing enteritis and of mixed infections were rather non-specific, diagnosis in all herds was confirmed by gross pathological analysis, intestinal histology and bacteriological culture. After initial evaluation in 135 litters (1500 piglets), metaphylaxis consisted of penicillin for outbreaks of acute disease or of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid pending results of laboratory confirmation. Vaccination with a C. perfringens toxoid vaccine (Gletvax 6, also containing E. coli pilus antigens) together with penicillin chemoprophylaxis was used in 2400 litters (27,000 piglets). In 12 to 17% of litters disease recurred during this combined prophylaxis. Necrotizing enteritis persisted in all affected herds throughout the follow-up period.","1270":"The case of a 11 year-old mix breed dog is being described. It initially presented for watery diarrhea and inappetence. During the diagnostic workup, the dog developed a sustained ventricular tachycardia. Echocardiography showed a mass extending from the wall of the right ventricle which filled up the ventricle almost completely. Histopathologic examination of the mass after euthanasia of the dog revealed a hemangiosarcoma.","1271":"Cryptorchism is an inherited congenital abnormality characterized by the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. Diagnosis can be difficult if the retained testicular tissue cannot be localized during clinical examination and the history of the animal is unknown, or if the animal shows persistent male behaviour despite the history of successful previous castration. The present case report describes the history of a cryptorchid Lama and the techniques of general anesthesia and laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy advocated.","1272":"Localised dermatitis, for example unspecific eczema or skinfold pyoderma, is a very common diagnosis in dogs. Typical and impressive complaints are pruritus, erythema, erosion and oozing surface. With respect to the underlying disease dermatological treatment is indicated, usually based on antimicrobial and antipruriginous active substances, it can include transient glucocorticoids. An effective and safe alternative might be a phytotherapeutic topical preparation containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil exerts both antimicrobial and antipruriginous effects. In an open multicenter study efficacy and safety of a standardized 10% tea tree oil cream applied thinly and twice daily for 4 weeks was tested in 53 dogs with chronic dermatitis, particularly non-specific eczema, allergic dermatitis, interdigital pyoderma, acral lick dermatitis and skinfold pyoderma. Analysis of efficacy assessed by investigating veterinarians showed a good or very good response to treatment for 82% of the dogs, significant at a 5% level (p = 0.05). At the end of the study a strong and significant reduction (p = 0.001) as well as disappearance of major symptoms were observed. Only two adverse events (local reactions) possibly related to tea tree oil occurred during therapy. Consequently the tested study medication (Bogaskin) can be considered an alternative for uncomplicated and localised dermatitis in dogs. Bogaskin might allow reduction of other pharmaceutical products, perhaps even replace standard therapy.","1273":"The lipophilic yeast Malassezia pachydermatis is part of the normal skin flora of most warm-blooded organisms. In a number of surveys it could be demonstrated that this yeast species might be involved in different skin diseases like seborrhoeic dermatitis, especially in dogs and cats. In order to look for an alternative therapeutic agent to the commonly used antimycotic and antiseptic synthetic substances the in vitro activity of Australian tea tree oil, the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia, against several strains of Malassezia pachydermatis was examined. All tested strains showed remarkably high susceptibility to tea tree oil. With these results the excellent antibacterial activity of tea tree oil is extended to a new group of fungal pathogens colonizing mainly mammals' skin. During the last ten years there was an increasing popularity of tea tree oil containing human health care products. The presented data open up new horizons for this essential oil as a promising alternative agent for topical use in veterinary medicine as well.","1274":"A health problem of an animal or a group of animals represents a potential stress situation for the animal keeper. In this article, the transactional stress model, which was developed in social psychology was applied on the animal keeper and shows, how he perceives the influence of animal care. If veterinary help is considered relevant, it may lead to an improved coping, which affects the health of the animal keeper and the animal as well. This viewpoint leads to a cycle, in which cause, success, coping and utility are closely linked together.","1275":"Immune mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in dogs is a severe disease with a high mortality rate. As human immunoglobulin (HIG) was reported to be beneficial for the treatment of IMHA in dogs we examined the influence of HIG on the course of the disease in our dogs with IMHA. Of 22 dogs with primary IMHA 9 dogs received in addition to routine immunosuppressive therapy HIG at a dose of 0.19 to 0.68 g\/kg (median 0.35 g\/kg), 13 dogs did not receive HIG (-HIG group). Both groups were similar in terms of age, weight, the presence of autoagglutination, spherocytosis, positive Coombs' test, icterus and pigmenturia. The lowest hematocrit measured during the disease was significantly lower in the +HIG group compared to the -HIG group and dogs in the +HIG group received significantly more transfusions than those of the -HIG group. This is an indication for more severe disease signs of the +HIG group dogs. Although mortality during hospitalization and the time from hospital admission to release or death was not significantly different between the two groups, we interpret this similar course of the IMHA despite more severe signs of the +HIG group dogs as a potential positive effect of the HIG therapy.","1276":"Crenosoma (C.) vulpis infection was diagnosed in 10 dogs aged between 0.5 and 12 years (median 4 years) during a 4-year period. The predominant clinical sign in all dogs was coughing which lasted from 1 day to &gt; 4 months. Hematological abnormalities included eosinophilia in 5\/9 dogs, basophilia in 3\/9 dogs, and mild monocytosis in 6\/9 dogs. Thoracic radiographs (n = 9) were normal in 1 dog, showed a mild bronchial or interstitial pattern in 4 dogs, and moderate to marked changes (bronchial-interstitial to alveolar) in 4 dogs. Endoscopic findings (n = 9) varied from mild erythematous bronchitis (n = 3) to marked bronchitis with accumulation of large amounts of mucus (n = 2), irregular nodular mucosal surface (n = 2), accumulation of pus (n = 1), and bronchial hemorrhage (n = 1). Adult worms were observed in 2 dogs. Bronchial lavage cytology revealed inflammation with predominance of eosinophils in 7\/10 dogs, eosinophils and neutrophils in 2\/10 dogs, and neutrophils in 1\/10 dogs. C. vulpis larvae were identified in the BAL of 5\/10 dogs. Fecal examinations with the Baermann technique was the most sensitive method and positive in all 10 dogs. C. vulpis infection has to be considered in the differential diagnosis in dogs of all ages presenting with acute or chronic cough.","1277":"The pilot study included serum analysis of ionized calcium, copper, zinc, various hormones and amino acid profiles from dogs affected with panosteitis, as well as protein electrophoresis performed on bone biopsies. Results of these analyses are as follows: ionized calcium, copper, zinc and hormones (parathyroid hormone, IGF-1, T3 and T4) were within reference ranges. Eleven of 23 serum amino acids from panosteitis-affected dogs were found to be significantly increased (P = 0.05). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed on bone biopsies, which were pretreated with SDS, resulted in a double band of 39,000 D molecular weight in all panosteitis-affected dogs. Similar studies in control dogs resulted in a single band in this region. Attempts at amino acid sequencing from the N-terminal of the proteins in this double band region were unsuccessful. A chemical interference at the N-terminal end of these proteins was suspected. The composition of this double band is as yet unknown. The etiology of panosteitis could therefore not be definitively verified. However, it does appear that protein- or amino acid metabolism is affected in dogs with panosteitis.","1278":"","1279":"A proliferative dermatitis similar to the condition generally referred to as strawberry footrot was observed in two Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) from Eastern Alps, Italy. Branching septated filaments and packets of PAS-positive coccoid organisms were observed in histological sections of the affected skin. The actinomycete, Dermatophilus congolensis, was isolated from crusted lesions in one chamois. As wild ruminants are presumed to be a reservoir of infection in the Alpine area, the authors discuss the potential role of chamois in the epidemiology of dermatophilosis.","1280":"Panosteitis, an idiopathic bone disease of young dogs, was investigated in the light of a new, empirically based hypothesis governing its pathogenesis. Extensive clinical observations suggest a close relationship between the incidence of this disease and the commercialization of various protein-rich, high-calorie dog foods. The theory of an \"osseous compartment syndrome\" provides a hypothetical pathogenesis, which corroborates this findings. An excessive accumulation of protein causes intraosseous edema due to its osmotic effects. Because bone is a rigid compartment, this leads to an increase in intramedullary pressure and compression of blood vessels. Subsequent osseous ischemia leads to a deficient metabolic state (decreased oxygenation, inadequate influx of nutritive substances, local acidosis, decreased removal of metabolites, disruption of local biochemical processes, etc.), and a vicious circle is created due to the resulting local inflammation. The disease is aggravated by increased metabolism due to excessive physical activity. Within the context of a pilot study, clinical, radiographic, scintigraphic and thermographic examinations and a therapeutic trial with benzopyron were carried out. In addition, more modern investigative tools, including osteomyelography, magnetic resonance tomography and intraosseous pressure measurements were used to provide objective data concerning the pathogenesis of panosteitis. In most cases, clinical remission was seen within days of monotherapy with the proteolytic substance, benzopyron (Cumartrin). This finding appears to corroborate our hypothesis.","1281":"Since September 1, 2001, castration of male calves and small ruminants in Switzerland is not allowed without anesthesia. The use of rubber rings for that purpose is forbidden. This change of the legislation has been claimed by the Swiss consumers and is aimed to increase the animal welfare. The current paper provides a review of the different techniques of anesthesia and castration that may be advocated in male ruminants. Sedation with xylazine and injection of lidocaine in the area of the base of the scrotum, followed by closed castration with the Burdizzo represents a safe technique for painfree castration of calves and lambs.","1282":"In this study we present mitotic- and meiotic investigations in an anatomical abnormal bovine fetus. The abnormality could be classified as \"schistosoma reflexum\", which was never described in fetuses in the literature. In the mitotical chromosome preparations from fibroblast cultures the examined fetus showed no chromosomal difference in comparison to the standard synaptonemal complexes (SC) which were prepared from the fetus at the age of 92 days post coitum. In the SCs from the abnormal fetus 43.75% of the investigated cells showed abnormalities such as \"loop,\" \"nonhomologue pairing\" and \"multivalency\" in the pairing behavior of the chromosomes. In comparison, less than 5% of the cells in normal embryos showed such abnormalities.","1283":"Two Siberian Huskies were presented because of anorexia, chronic diarrhoea, polydipsia and polyuria. The most significant clinical finding was a severe dehydration. Laboratory results showed severe electrolyte disturbances with sodium: potassium ratios of 13.2 and 15.4, respectively. Hypoadrenocorticism could be excluded in both dogs with an ACTH stimulation test. The plasma aldosterone concentrations before and after stimulation were very high, which might be due to a stimulation by the electrolyte disturbances. The final diagnosis was an infection with the whipworm Trichuris vulpis and secondary pseudohypoadrenocorticism. A life-threatening dehydration syndrome with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis due to intestinal parasitism has been reported in earlier studies. Up till now sodium: potassium ratios less than 14, however, have only been seen in animals with Morbus Addison. The severe hyperkalemia in these dogs might be due to a particular sensitivity in this breed.","1284":"Intracranial astrocytomas are rarely diagnosed in cats. Clinical and pathological aspects of these tumors are more often described in humans and dogs. The classification scheme used in human medicine is of important prognostic value. We have analyzed clinical neurological and pathological findings from 8 cats with intracranial astrocytomas. The animals were 10.1 years old in average and presented with a history of tetraparesis (n = 3), epilepsy (n = 2), loss of balance (n = 3) and dyspnoe (n = 1). The latter cat died immediately after the first presentation while the other animals were euthanized because of a progressive course of the symptoms despite therapy. Even though feline astrocytomas, that we could classify into 4 different types in this study, are clinically and pathologically well correlated with those of other species, a prognostically useful classification has never been established before.","1285":"In a survey which lasted one year and included data of 73 dairy cows with their calves, colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) of 22 primiparous cows and serum IgG of their calves were lower than the corresponding IgG levels of 51 multiparous cows and their calves. Serum IgG concentration was not correlated with diarrhoea incidence. Although there were no seasonal differences in the IgG concentration of colostrum and calf serum, neonatal diarrhoea incidence was higher in calves which were born in winter than in calves which were born in summer (P &lt; 0.01). Thus the high diarrhoea incidence in winter was not a consequence of an insufficient IgG transfer to the calves. The 60 calves of the second study were fed colostrum on the first day of life. From the second to the tenth day 28 experimental calves received milk and 0.5 l of surplus colostrum of the first and second milking twice a day, whereas 32 control calves received milk only twice a day. Two of the 28 experimental and 11 of the 32 control calves suffered from diarrhoea during the first ten days of life (P &lt; 0.05). These results show that the ingestion of surplus colostrum in addition to milk after the first day of life protects the new-born calf against infectious diarrhoea.","1286":"","1287":"","1288":"","1289":"","1290":"The combination of Medetomidine and Butorphanol leads to a sufficient sedation with good analgesia and is thus superior to the application of Medetomidine only. By reducing the dosage of Medetomidine, reduced cardio-respiratory side-effects are to be expected. The comparative application of the two Butorphanol preparations Torbugesic (group T) and Morphasol (group M) did not show any differences concerning effect and tolerance. No statistically significant and clinically relevant differences between the two groups were observed for any of the parameters.","1291":"Teat obstructions cause considerable financial loss in dairy industry. Recently, progress in teat surgery was made by the use of minimal invasive surgical instrumentation. The technique of theloresectoscopy as well as short- and long-term results of this surgical intervention are presented in this study. The clinical reports of 15 dairy cows with distal teat obstructions operated with the theloresectoscope between May 1999 and January 2000 at the clinic for ruminants, Department of clinical veterinary medicine, University of Berne were reviewed. Data collected by telephone conversation with the owners included: somatic cell count and milk flow at machine milking during the lactation of surgery (lactation 1), as well as during the lactation following surgery (lactation 2). Eighty-seven percent of the owners reported normal milk flow during lactation 1 and 93% during lactation 2. Considering the fact that only 46.7% of the cows showed negative results in the California mastitis test (CMT) during lactation 1, many owners reported a high somatic cell count being a disadvantage of this surgical technique. Normal (negative) CMT results during lactation 2, however, were reported by 80% of the owners. Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus explained the high somatic cell count in 2 of 15 cases. In conclusion, theloresectoscopy is a valuable minimal invasive surgical technique that can be fully recommended for treatment of distal teat obstructions in dairy cows.","1292":null,"1293":"","1294":"The goal of this report was to describe the clinical signs and diagnosis of Visna in a seven-year-old East Friesian milk sheep. A striking feature was that the ewe's behaviour changed frequently. At one time, the ewe was somnolent. A few minutes later, the sheep was alert and eating hay. The ewe was thin. It had a slight head tilt and a severe generalised ataxia. Based on the neurological symptoms and chronic weight loss, a tentative diagnosis of visna was made. Serological testing for maedi-visna was positive, and the ewe was euthanised. A postmortem examination was performed, and lung and brain samples were collected aseptically. Cell cultures from these organs were positive for viral enzymatic reverse transcriptase and for maedi-visna RNA.","1295":"Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and goats, which leads to neurological signs and ends with the death of the infected animal. In Switzerland only a few cases were reported since 1982. In 1999, a questionnaire survey was conducted to increase information about neurological diseases in sheep and goat breeding farms. The aim was to estimate the frequency of neurological disorders including Scrapie and to increase the disease awareness of sheep and goat breeders. The main goal of the study was to increase the reporting of suspect cases of Scrapie and its differential diagnoses. Out of a database of all registered farms with at least five breeding sheep or breeding goats a random sample of 4711 was drawn to which anonymous questionnaires were sent. The return rate was 36%. In a parallel study, 150 voluntarily participants were interviewed using the same questionnaire. The results of both parts of the survey coincided. For the years 1997 and 1998, on average 1.0% of the breeding sheep and breeding goats showed neurological signs. 7.7% of the breeders indicated to have observed animals with neurological symptoms in their flock. At the population level, a total of 1954-2336 animals with neurological signs are observed in 691-929 flocks. The minority is reported to the veterinary authorities.","1296":"","1297":null,"1298":"Antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight Swiss laboratories from May 1999 to February 2000. Using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococci, and enterococci. Differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in E. coli and salmonella. Some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. A significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. This includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli. A similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid. Staphylococci from dogs (S. intermedius and S. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. Finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in Switzerland is relatively favorable.","1299":"Rehabilitation is an important part of the treatment of neurological diseases. The primary goal of these methods is an optimal functional restoring of the neuro-muscular system. Massages, thermo-, hydro- and electrotherapy, as well as therapy of movement are different treatment possibilities with their own indication, which are combined in a physiotherapy program. It follows an overview of the different physiotherapeutic methods and their application in some of the most common neurological diseases, as for example intervertebral disc problems or degenerative myelopathy.","1300":"Malocclusion of the canines, which in dogs is frequent and often has a congenital pattern, remains a challenge to treat. Steeply positioned lower jaw canines are corrected by means of a specifically designed orthodontic intervention. The case at hand was characterized by a combination of a slight skeletal distal bite and compensatory distal tilt of the entire premaxilla (retrusion, caudal tilt) with a mesial tilt of the canines in the upper jaw (rostral and anterior tilt). An individual solution was found which resulted in a functional adjustment of both upper and lower jaws. A model cast device which included both appropriately tilted areas and screws to ensure distal adjustment solved the problem.","1301":"To establish the role of Mycoplasma bovis as an agent of respiratory disease in fattening calves, an epidemiologic study was undertaken. A recently validated commercially available ELISA was used to diagnose M. bovis infection by seroconversion in paired sera obtained for each animal at entry in the fattening herd and at follow-up seven weeks later. Management data as well as relevant clinical and epidemiological variables were prospectively recorded. The overall seroconversion rate observed among the 415 calves in 23 fattening herds on 13 farms was 54.7%. Significant risk factors for seroconversion were the mixing of fattening herds of different age groups (risk ratio RR 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 1.96), and the presence of at least one seropositive animal in the fattening herd (RR: 2.02; CI: 1.69 to 2.40). The proportion of clinical episodes of respiratory disease attributable to M. bovis infection was 50.3%. The average weight gain during the observation period was reduced by 7.6% in seroconverting calves and these animals had about 2 times more antibiotics prescribed by a veterinarian than calves remaining negative for M. bovis throughout follow-up (RR 1.83). Maternal antibodies against M. bovis were detected in 39% of newborn calves born from seronegative cows and had a half-life of 20 days, potentially limiting the usefulness of vaccines against M. bovis in this age group.","1302":"Reduced oxygenation activates specific expression of erythropoietin (EPO) and other hypoxia-regulated genes. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Unregulated overexpression of EPO results in a hematocrit value of about 80%; transgenic mice were shown to adapt to this polyglobulia.","1303":"A thirteen-year old spayed female poodle was referred because of atrophy of temporal and masseter muscles on the left and head tilt and episodical circling to the right side. Additionally, decreased facial sensation, absent menace reaction, palpebral and corneal reflexes on the left side, as well as ipsilateral hemiparesis and tongue palsy were noticed. Generalised vestibular ataxia and hypermetria in the front limbs were present. Based on the clinical signs, the presumptive anatomical localization of the lesion was the cerebellopontine angle including parts of the caudal brainstem with involvement of the trigeminal, facial and hypoglossal nerves. Involvement of either flocculonodular lobe or the caudal cerebellar peduncle on the left side causing paradoxical vestibular disease was suspected. On magnetic resonance imaging a large enhancing lesion in the area of the left cerebellopontine angle involving the trigeminal nerve and compressing cerebellum and brainstem was seen. Because of the poor prognosis the dog was euthanized on the owner's request. This space occupying lesion could be identified as a trigeminal neurofibrosarcoma\/schwannoma on post mortem histopathological examination.","1304":"Since a new envelope subgroup (J) of the avian leukosis-sarcomatosis-complex was isolated for the first time from broiler breeders in the United Kingdom in 1989 and was characterized and associated with myeloid leukosis (syn. myelocytomatosis) the emergence of this subgroup was reported from all over the world. Thus the first known case of subgroup J avian leukosis in Switzerland in four imported broiler breeder flocks will be described. A total of 53 broiler breeder birds from four flocks showing reduced performance and increased mortality were submitted for postmortem examination. Approximately 20 blood samples from each flock were monitored serologically for antibodies against avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J). On necropsy myeloid leukosis (ML) was diagnosed in all four flocks. Furthermore the blood samples of three flocks showed significant ELISA-titres for ALV-J.","1305":"Histopathological striated muscle examination is one of the most important and sensitive tests in diagnosis of muscle and\/or nerve diseases. Although muscle biopsy is a relatively easy procedure, it is not frequently performed in small animal practice conditions. Different biopsy techniques have been described in veterinary literature. Punch biopsy of striated muscle appears to be a less invasive and quicker method in comparison with traditional surgical excision technique. Additionally, punch biopsy provide good quality and adequate amount of muscle tissue for diagnostic histopathological evaluation. The aim of this study is to describe striated muscle punch biopsy technique and to encourage use of it under the conditions of small animal practice. The described biopsy method can be specially advantageous in screening of inherited muscle diseases in affected litters or even wider animal population.","1306":"Phytotherapy is based on the use of herbal remedies (phytopharmaceuticals) for therapy and prophylactic measures of illness in humans and animals. Animal owners as well as veterinarians (surgeons) are more and more interested in veterinary phytotherapy. The following review explains fundamentals of veterinary phytotherapy as well as the production, application and possible side-effects of veterinary herbal remedies (veterinary phytopharmaceuticals).","1307":"","1308":"In 32 male dogs colopexy, vasopexy, cystopexy and castration was performed for the treatment of perineal hernia. Recurrence rate in this study is 22%, what is comparable to other studies using different methods. The degree of severity and the number of complications is lower with this technique than with others. Enlargement of the prostate was evident in 59% and bladder retroflexion in 22% of the dogs. A celiotomy allows to recognize, assess, reduce and fix displaced organs which is not possible by using other methods. The aim is to regain the tubular structure of the ampulla recti and to fix prostate and bladder cranioventrally to the pelvic entrance. The castration performed at the same time causes the prostate gland to atrophy within 2-3 weeks, what makes the pelvic entrance even wider and the dogs return to normal defecation.","1309":"In this paper the technique and long-term results for abdominal wall ruptures in the ventral flank are described in 16 cows that underwent surgery between January 1990 and October 1999. Most injuries were caused by a horn of another cow. In three cases the rupture was repaired longer than 6 weeks after traumatic injury. The other defects were treated surgically 6.4 (0-25) days after they occurred. The muscle defects were closed layer by layer with simple continuous sutures (polyglactin 910, 6 metric) under general anesthesia in lateral recumbency and the sutured defect was reinforced with a synthetic mesh (polyester or polyglactin 910) fixed to the outside of the external oblique abdominal muscle. The most frequent postoperative complication was subcutaneous seroma. It was treated successfully by incision and drainage. All patients were released 11.6 +\/- 5.5 (6-23) days after surgery. A telephone survey 53 +\/- 26 (7-106) months after surgery revealed that the patients had an average survival time of 30 (2-104) months, had born one to seven calves without any complications and that only one cow had had an unsatisfactory milk yield. One cow had to be slaughtered 2 months after surgery because of a relapse. Synthetic mesh was used successfully to close the defect in 15 animals. The functional as well as the cosmetic result of the described operation was good to excellent.","1310":"The population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group A, n = 13) and their controls (group B, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group C, n = 90) or without (group D, n = 10) lesions were collected after slaughter. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from calves in group A (46%), followed by Haemophilus somnus (23%), Mannheimia haemolytica (15%), Streptococcus suis and Pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). Only S. suis (22%) and P. multocida (11%) were found in group B. P. multocida was isolated from 32% group C calves, H. somnus from 11%, A. pyogenes from 7.8%, M. haemolytica from 2.2% and S. suis from 1.1%. No specific pathogens were isolated in group D. Prevalence of Mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group A and 37% in group C. Ninety-eight strains were tested for resistAnce to antibiotics. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in M. haemolytica (46%). High percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). Therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of Mycoplasma bovis.","1311":"","1312":"A six-month old bitch presenting a sub-lingual mucocele and hematoma associated with coagulation disorders died four days after the surgical treatment of the mucocele. The necropsy revealed a canine angiostrongylosis, a disease rarely seen in Switzerland. This article summarizes the biology of Angiostrongylus vasorum and describes the lesions and symptoms caused by this cardio-pulmonary helminthosis, as well as its diagnosis and treatment. The connections between angiostrongylosis and coagulation disorders are also discussed.","1313":"The persistent effect of doramectin injectable against gastrointestinal nematodes was investigated in a controlled field study with 70 sheep kept on alpine pastures in Switzerland. After grazing on home pastures for four weeks 50 lambs and 20 ewes were allocated to two equal groups according to age and body weight. At turnout to alpine pasture in June doramectin (0.3 mg\/kg) was administered by intramuscular injection to 25 lambs and 10 ewes (Group D), whereas control sheep (Group K) remained untreated. Animals of both groups were kept on separate pastures (altitude: 1100 m) and were rotated between three paddocks during a total grazing period of 13 weeks. After doramectin treatment faecal examinations of Group D sheep showed a marked reduction of the trichostrongyle egg output which remained close to zero for eight weeks. During this period serum pepsinogen levels did not indicate the presence of a substantial immature worm burden in the abomasal mucosa. In the last five weeks of the alpine grazing period the trichostrongyle egg counts increased markedly in the lambs of Group D. Lambs of the control group developed moderate-to-high Haemonchus-infections, and eight animals of this group had to be treated with anthelmintics. Lambs of Group D had gained significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more weight eight weeks after turnout whereas the mean bodyweight stagnated during the last five weeks of the grazing period. The results indicate, that the single administration of 0.3 mg\/kg doramectin to lambs and ewes provided good protection against severe infections with gastrointestinal nematodes for a period of approximately eight weeks.","1314":"Two useful techniques for the repair of caudal sacral fractures and sacrococcygeal fractures\/luxations are described. Pre- and postoperative clinical, neurological and radiological findings in 16 operated animals (13 cats and 3 dogs) were compared with findings in 17 (13 cats and 4 dogs) conservatively treated animals. In the surgically treated patients follow up findings were characterized by absence of hyperesthesia and a higher number of animals with recovered tail function. The authors suggest the use of these techniques in cases of caudal sacral fractures or sacrococcygeal fractures\/luxations.","1315":"The annular ligament constriction is characterized by a disproportion between the available space and the contents within the fetlock tunnel. The main symptoms are a persisting lameness, distention of the tendon sheath, a typical \"notch\" when the fetlock is viewed from the side and a hyperflexion pain in the fetlock. The surgical treatment consists of the transection of the fetlock annular ligament. The conservative management can be considered as a independent therapy or as a preparation for a subsequent desmotomy. The medical records of 75 horses suffering from fetlock tunnel syndrome presented at the Veterinary Surgery Clinic of the University of Zurich were studied. 39 horses with 41 affected limbs were reexamined clinically and ultrasonographically. 70% of the surgical cases and 82% of the conservatively treated cases were judged to be sound. Altogether it can be said that the surgical case group had a success rate of 62% while the conservatively treated group showed a success rate of 58%.","1316":"Application of a sodium phosphate containing enema caused life-threatening metabolic disorders in a Dachshund and two cats. Clinical signs were characterised by dehydration and various neurological deficits including seizures. Most striking laboratory abnormalities were hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and polycythemia. Despite intensive treatment the dog died, whereas the cats recovered completely. In face of possible severe and potentially fatal metabolic abnormalities sodium phosphate enemas, such as Practo-Clyss, should be used with caution or not at all in cats and small dogs.","1317":"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) was found in three five- and nine-week-old pigs from two feeder pig producer farms. Clinical signs were persistent diarrhea and wasting. The animals showed histomorphologic changes characteristic for \"Postweaning Multisystemic Syndrome\" (PMWS). One animal had the typical basophilic intracytoplasmatic circoviral inclusion bodies in the Peyer's patches of the ileum. Circoviral DNA was detected in the lymphatic organs as well as in the liver. This case report is the first description of PCV 2 in Switzerland.","1318":"In this study, done in the context of normal veterinary practice, the possibilities of using Memoprint have been evaluated. The values of systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and pulse rate (PR) in healthy cats (n = 72) have been determined, as well as the values of SAP, DAP and PR before (n = 26), during (n = 40) and after (n = 16) an anaesthesia for routine surgery. The results show that Memoprint allows a quick, convenient and correct determination of SAP (average: 122.7 mmHg) and DAP (88.5), but an imprecise determination of the PR. The measures are not highly repeatable with conscious cats (SAP: 0.68, DAP: 0.51), unlike that obtained before (0.90, 0.86), during (0.96, 0.90) and after (0.88, 0.58) the anaesthesia, indicating once again the importance of the cats' familiarity and cooperation with the veterinarian. An analysis of the variance of the values of blood pressure shows their direct relationship with age, sex, breed and style of life of the cats and an increase in pressure in those over ten years of age.","1319":"In a retrospective study (1995) cytological diagnoses of 3987 specimen of different origin in the dog were evaluated. Biopsies were performed at the Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion animals at the University of Utrecht or sent in by external practitioners. Biopsies were obtained from different regions including skin\/subcutis, mammary gland, lymph node, external ear canal, kidney, urinary bladder, urethra, prostatic gland, testes, bone, bone marrow, synovia, nose, oral cavity, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchial lavage, lung, spleen, liver, conjunctiva, and retrobulbar region. The majority of biopsies were obtained from skin\/subcutis (n = 1815), lymph node (n = 706), and mammary gland (n = 415). A high percentage of non-diagnostic biopsies were observed with biopsies of lung, mammary gland, cerebrospinal fluid, external ear canal, and oral cavity. The frequencies of diagnoses in the different areas will be presented and the diagnostic indications of cytology are discussed.","1320":null,"1321":"This case report is about a 9-year-old male castrated Persian cat with chronic renal failure. After physical examination and ultrasonography polycystic kidney disease (PKD) was diagnosed. Various aspects of etiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis of PKD are discussed.","1322":"To elucidate the importance of different causes of mortality which could explain the downward trend of the hare populations in Switzerland and for monitoring selected zoonoses, the health and reproductive status of 167 perished brown hares (Lepus europaeus) was assessed. Concerning causes of mortality, traumas were by far the most frequent diagnosis, 80% of the hares dying because of injuries. Animals killed by road traffic were highly represented. Predators (such as dogs, domestic cats, lynx, martens, buzzards, and golden eagles) killed 16% of the analysed animals. In juveniles, predation was significantly more frequent than in adults. Infectious diseases led to death in 15% of the animals, and cases of pasteurellosis, brucellosis, pseudotuberculosis, tularaemia, listeriosis, and toxoplasmosis were diagnosed. In 5% of the hares, the cause of death pertained to other categories or remained unclear. Reproductive performance was judged to be normal, since mean litter size was 2.5 per female and pregnancy rate in March-June was 74%. We conclude that neither a specific infectious disease, for which adult hares are particularly susceptible, nor an insufficient reproductive performance are responsible for the decline of brown hare populations in Switzerland. This phenomenon is rather a cause of a reduced survival rate in leverets.","1323":"Alterations of the integument of fattening pigs were investigated on a total of eleven farms with the following housing systems: \"Krieger\" system, fully slatted floors, partially slatted floors and kennel housing systems. For this purpose, the alterations of the integument of the animals were visually assessed at different times during fattening. In addition, spot investigations were carried out on three farms with deep litter systems. In the non-littered systems, significantly more changes at the limbs were observed than in the littered systems. The least damages occurred in the deep litter system. Similar as with cattle, soft and deformable lying areas seem to be a prerequisite for the prevention of such alterations. With respect to injuries caused by tailbiting, apart from possibilities of activity, other parameters such as air quality and space availability also play an important role.","1324":"Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a usually fatal infectious disease of cattle with global distribution. Based on the recent introduction of a diagnostic PCR assay and a competitive inhibition ELISA (ciELISA) epidemiological data were collected on field cases in Switzerland. Throughout a three-year period, an MCF incidence of 0.6@1000 was observed, with a gradient of cases from Eastern to Western Switzerland. While the cantons Wallis, Vaud and Geneva reported no and the remaining western cantons only reported a few cases, the highest incidence was observed in the cantons Appenzell Innerrhoden, Lucern, Glarus, Grison, St. Gallen, Schwyz, and Thurgau. MCF occurred seasonally and an age-related clustering was also observed. About 50% of all cases and all outbreaks with more than one animal in a single herd occurred between April and June. Animals between six months and two years were strongly over represented. Observations on four surviving cattle showed that the outcome of the disease is not invariably fatal and that these persistently infected cows can produce healthy negative calves. Investigations on the aetiology indicate that the main reservoir for OvHV-2 is in sheep and possibly goats, while cattle do not normally harbor the virus. An OvHV-2 negative sheep herd was raised from lambs, which were reared colostrum-free and in isolation from their mothers. The success rate clearly indicated that vertical intrauterine infection is not the main mode of transmission among sheep. Therefore, horizontal, seasonally occurring transmission of OvHV-2 among sheep has to be assumed.","1325":"","1326":"The clinical findings, results of further investigations and necropsy of a 15-month old heifer with multiple congenital heart defects are presented. The symptoms were caused by a high ventricle septum defect and a hypoplastic, completely dextroponed aorta (DORV). Hematology, radiology and ultrasonography findings, right heart and pulmonary blood pressure, and blood gas measurements, as well as electro- and phonocardiograms are presented. The consequences of the multiple cardiac anomalies for the pulmonary circulation are described.","1327":"The distribution of canine dirofilariosis in Southern Ticino (Switzerland) and in the neighbouring provinces of Varese and Como (Italy) was investigated. Blood samples were collected from 308 dogs which had remained in the local area and were outdoor-housed, older than 1.5 years and had not been treated previously with preventive or microfilaricidal drugs. Microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens were found in 33 (10.7%) and 17 (5.5%) dogs, respectively. Ten more dogs (3.2%) tested positive for circulating antigens. Four infected dogs lived in Southern Ticino: two harboured D. immitis, one D. repens and one had a mixed infection. In addition, 3887 mosquitoes were captured in five sample sites by means of dog-baited traps. Culex pipiens, Aedes geniculatus and Ae. vexans were the most abundant species. Infective stages of D. immitis were observed in local strains of Ae. geniculatus and Cx. pipiens, following engorgement on a microfilaraemic dog and the successive rearing in laboratory conditions. A chemo-prophylactic scheme in four administrations between July and October is recommended for Southern Switzerland.","1328":"A case of poisoning by chronic ingestion of lead in calves with a peracute clinical course is described. The source of lead was a prime coat of white lead on old white painted doors. These doors originated from an institution for aged people and had been used as pen walls for fattening calves. About 12 weeks later five animals died within hours after onset of CNS-symptoms. The post mortem examination of three animals revealed one with multifocal laminar edema and mild vasculitis in the cerebrocortex, one with acid fast intranuclear inclusion bodies in the renal tubular epithelial cells and one without lesions. Liver, kidney and abomasal contents of two animals were analysed for lead content. The concentration was diagnostic for lead poisoning in one case only.","1329":"A total of 74 dairy cows with 105 separate lesions were treated and the healing process was observed for half a year and the results compared with the biochemical data. The mean time for the formation of a closed layer of horn was 25 days for lesions with slight corium alterations, 33 days for moderate and 42 days for severe alterations. Thirty days after the initial treatment 68% of all lesions were completely covered by a solid layer of new horn. The further evaluation of the healing process was based on quality and rate of the new horn formation, recovery from lameness and sensitivity to hooftesters. Using these parameters the healing potential of exposed corium was judged one month after treatment with a scoring system. The 30-day-healing process was considered to be good in 61% and moderate to bad in 39% of the cows. The concentration of glucose, cholesterin, LDH and blood urea was increased in one third of the animals. Phosphorus and magnesium concentrations were lower than the reference values in 30%, and 26% of the animals, respectively. Cows with prolonged healing had higher levels of bilirubin, creatinkinase, LDH, ALT and AST than cows with a good healing process. Concentration of iron, vitamin A and biotin were significantly lower in cows with moderate to bad healing parameters than cows with a good healing potential. From these results it is suggested that biochemical blood parameters and the vitamin status might influence the healing of uncomplicated sole ulcers, respectively.","1330":"This paper describes a 6-year-old Simmental bull with diabetes mellitus. The animal was referred to our clinic because of severe weight loss and chronic indigestion. Clinical examination revealed markedly disturbed general condition, impaired forestomach function and polyuria. There was aciduria, glucosuria and ketonuria. The most important biochemical findings were severe hyperglycemia, markedly increased activities of hepatic enzymes and severe metabolic acidosis. Plasma concentrations of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine were lower than normal, whereas those of glucagon were higher than normal. Based on these findings, a diagnosis (secondary) diabetes mellitus was made. The bull was slaughtered and histological examination revealed mixed cell pancreatitis with severe degeneration of islet cells. Immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas showed that very few insulin-, glucagon-, somatostatin- and pancreatic polypeptide, insulin-like growth factor-I and adrenomedullin-producing islet cells were present.","1331":"Purulent osteomyelitis caused by Arcanobacterium pyogenes was diagnosed in three pigs aged between 3 and 4 months by radiological and pathological findings. Osteomyelitis was localized in metaphysis and\/or epiphysis of limb bones. The prevalence of osteomyelitis in swine seems to be underestimated because inspection of limb bones is not a routine procedure either at slaughter or at necropsy. Osteomyelitis may also have consequences for meat cutting. Osteomyelitis can be controlled by prophylactic procedures.","1332":"60 pigs representing all age groups (suckling pigs, weaner pigs, hogs, gilts and sows; thereof 37 females, 2 males, 21 castrated males) were examined by ultrasound of the liver and by ultrasound guided gallbladder puncture. The visibility of the liver and gallbladder was strongly influenced by the size of the animals. The thickness of the abdominal and thoracic walls in older animals proved to be a highly ultrasound-absorptive medium, which limited the ability to assess the underlying tissue structures. As a result, gallbladder puncture of these animals was possible only with a certain degree of technical difficulty. The gallbladder puncture procedure itself posed little risk to the animal. The primary risk resulted from the general anesthesia required. Autopsy showed no pathological findings due to gallbladder puncture with the exception of minimal, rapidly healing, local infectious processes. The bile proved to be a suitable medium of the detection of mycotoxins and their metabolites. Selective accumulation of these toxins in bile provide a more reliable diagnostic tool than the standard mycotoxicological tests of feed.","1333":"In swine medicine, the determination of hematology and blood chemistry parameters is of primary interest in connection with the detection of herd problems. For the evaluation of laboratory results the availability of reference values is a prerequisite. So far, no reference values of fattening pigs have been available in Switzerland. For this reason, in the present study reference values for hematology and blood chemistry were determined for two bodyweight categories, 40-60 kg (group 1) and 85-110 kg (group 2). Hematocrit, hemoglobin and RBC counts were lower in animals in group 1. The number of segmented neutrophils was markedly higher in group 1. Lymphocyte counts exceeded neutrophil values in both groups. Concentrations of total bilirubin, AST, CK and LDH partly reached very high levels due to hemolysis or contamination of the blood samples with muscle tissue.","1334":"Pig mange was investigated serologically in colostral samples with ELISA using Chekit Sarcoptest. This test has already been using to investigate sera samples from swine in veterinary practice. A total of 684 sow colostral samples were collected from 24 mange free breeding units and 6 units with clinical manifestation of mange infestation. The specificity of the test was more than 99% and the mean seroprevalence 30% (range 6% to 100%). This simple method will allow in the future not only the rapid and certain diagnosis of pig mange but also the screening of pig breeding units after eradication of the disease.","1335":"Sustainable animal production requires a healthy production system including healthy animals producing wholesome products. Epidemiology as a discipline is concerned with the occurrence of disease or disease indicators in populations as well as with factors influencing disease occurrence. By providing this information, epidemiology contributes significantly to the development and maintenance of healthy livestock. This is illustrated with the example of the enzootic pneumonia (EP) eradication programme of Switzerland. A series of observational studies were conducted in order to obtain the necessary knowledge to implement an area-wide EP eradication programme. The issues of economical eradication strategies at the herd level and the risk of re-infections were addressed. Simulation modelling and economical analysis were also applied. These research projects led to the successful start of a national eradication programme. The example of the EP eradication programme illustrates that applied epidemiological research provides critical information for the planning, implementation and evaluation of disease control programmes and is thus a key tool in developing sustainable animal production.","1336":"The purpose of the study was to give an overview over the usefulness of ultrasonographic examination of parathyroid glands in dogs. By means of a 10 MHz high-resolution linear transducer it was possible to visualize parathyroid glands in healthy dogs. There was a positive correlation between body weight and size of the parathyroid glands, additionally the likelihood to detect 4 glands increased with an increase in body weight. Dogs with chronic renal failure had significantly larger parathyroid glands than healthy dogs and dogs with acute renal failure. In dogs with hypercalcemia of malignancy either none or parathyroids which were small in relation to body weight were detected. In contrast visualisation of parathyroid masses in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism was easy due to their increased size and anechoic appearance. In dogs with severe azotemia the ultrasonographic examination of the parathyroid glands is helpful to differentiate between acute and chronic renal failure, in dogs with hypercalcemia to differentiate between hypercalcemia of malignancy and hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism.","1337":"A two year old Swiss Alpine goat was referred to our clinic because of sterility. Ultrasound examination revealed a nonechogenic area cranially to the urinary bladder. As hydrometra was suspected, the goat was treated repeatedly with PGF2 alpha. Success of this therapy, however, was unsatisfactory and estrus was therefore induced by progesterone in combination with eCG and the goat mated. As conception failed and ultrasonography remained unchanged, laparoscopy was performed and a fluid filled structure could be located in the region of the right oviduct. After ovariohysterectomy and histo-pathological examination of the genital organs hydrosalpinx was diagnosed on both sides.","1338":"","1339":"","1340":"","1341":"","1342":"In a total of 94 cows the mean back fat thickness (BFT) on Day 275 of pregnancy and 2 to 3 days after calving (peripartal) as well as between Days 42 and 44 post partum (postpuerperal) has been examined sonographically. Based on their BFT levels all examined cows have been divided into three groups: overconditioned, optimal conditioned and underconditioned cows. Cows which were peripartal overconditioned had more often ovarian cysts (p &lt; 0.05) and were culled more frequently (p &lt; 0.1) because of infertility than peripartal cows which were optimal or underconditioned. Nevertheless, the interval from calving to conception of peripartal cows being in different physical conditions was not significantly different. Postpuerperal cows which were overconditioned had more often ovarian cysts (p &lt; 0.05) and were more frequently (p &lt; 0.05) slaughtered because of infertility than postpuerperal cows which were optimal or underconditioned. Postpuerperal cows which were over- or underconditioned had a significantly longer interval from calving to conception than cows which were optimal conditioned 6 weeks after calving. The correlation coefficient between peripartal and postpuerperal BFT was 0.82 (p &lt; 0.05). The decrease of BFT between the peripartal and postpuerperal timepoint had no significant influence on the frequency of ovarian cysts, the interval from calving to conception and the infertility caused culling rate.","1343":"Most animal-derived food products originate from production chains consisting of a series of well-defined, separate production steps. Undesired events affecting food safety can principally occur at any point within the production chain. The principle of integrated food safety assurance from stable to table has therefore been established. The livestock holding has thus to be understood as a fix element of the production chain, and the producer has to accept a part of the responsibility for food safety. On a farm, food safety can be negatively affected by animal feed (microbiological or toxicological contamination), management (hygiene, stocking density, cleaning and disinfecting), veterinary treatments (use of antibiotics) and recycling of slurry. Most relevant practices can be summarised under the standard of \"good farming practice\". HACCP programmes as they are applied in the processing industries could in principle also be used at the farm level. Influential management steps would need to be identified and controlled. This approach is, however, still in its infancy at present. Using the current monitoring systems, microbiological and toxicological problems in food are difficult to be identified before the end of the production chain. As the cause of a problem can be found at the farm level, traceability of products through the production chain is essential. In Switzerland, traceability of animals is realised using compulsory animal identification and the animal movement database. Using this link, information on the health status of a herd could be made available to the slaughterhouse in order to classify animals into food-safety risk categories. This principle is a key element in the ongoing discussion about visual meat inspection in Europe and elsewhere.","1344":"The risk of zoonotic disease transmission when handling livestock or animal products is substantial. In industrialized countries, the classical zoonotic diseases such as tuberculosis or brucellosis are no longer in the foreground. Latent zoonoses such as salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis can cause serious disease in humans and have become a major public health problem during the past years. Since animals infected with these pathogens show only mild transient disease or no clinical signs at all, new concepts in the entire production line (\"stable to table\") are necessary in order to avoid human infection. Two emerging viruses with zoonotic potential--avian influenza virus and Nipah virus--have been found in Asia in 1997 and 1999. Both diseases had a major impact on disease control and public health in the countries of origin. In order to cope threats from infectious diseases, in particular those of public health relevance, a combined effort among all institutions involved will be necessary. The proposed \"European Center for Infectious Diseases\" and the \"Swiss center for zoonotic diseases\" could be a potential approach in order to achieve this goal.","1345":"The first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Switzerland was diagnosed in November 1990. BSE is--in particular considering its eradication--different from many other livestock diseases. Strict disease control measures were taken from the very beginning by the Swiss authorities in order to protect public as well as animal health. In addition, BSE has stimulated enormous media interest and public concern. The occurrence of the born after the ban (BAB) cases, increasing questions about the zoonotic potential of the disease and trade restrictions against Switzerland led to the \"BSE-crisis\". In 1999, Switzerland internationally took a leading role in the surveillance of BSE by active investigation of targeted risk population.","1346":"This report describes the findings in a four-year-old Toggenburg goat with demodicosis. The skin had multifocal nodules, which were approximately 5 mm in diameter and contained thick yellow exsudate. Microscopic examination of the exsudate revealed numerous Demodex caprae. The goat was clipped and treated topically every five to seven days for a total of 12 treatments with a 1:100 dilution of amitraz (Ectodex, Hoechst Roussel Vet). The treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the number of skin nodules. However, new nodules appeared after treatment was discontinued and complete clinical cure was not achieved.","1347":"Two cats with large pituitary neoplasms (adenoma and adenocarcinoma) were treated with fractionated radiation therapy. Total doses of 40 Gy, respectively 36 Gy, were applied in 10 fractions of 4 Gy, and 3.6 Gy respectively. Side effects were minimal and transient. Anesthesia was well tolerated. Improvement of clinical signs could be observed during radiation therapy in both cats. One cat had a complete, the other a partial tumor response. One cat (suspicion of adenoma) was euthanized 1 3\/4 years after therapy due to unrelated disease. No tumor was found on histopathology, however a small focal necrosis of brain tissue in the irradiated field was observed. The second animal with a pituitary adenocarcinoma was euthanized because of tumor recurrence 1 1\/2 years after therapy. Radiation therapy was effective, despite the low total doses of radiation applied.","1348":"The OK antigens and the fimbriae F4 of E. coli with haemolysis isolated from 113 cases of oedema disease and\/or diarrhoea were identified serologically. The genes for F18 and for enterotoxins LT, STIa and STII as well as Shigatoxin Stx2e were determined by PCR. Fimbrial variants F18ab and F18ac were distinguished by means of indirect immunofluorescence on smears prepared from the intestinal mucosa and from cultures grown under appropriate conditions. Adhesive fimbriae were detected with every case or isolate, respectively, by means of at least one out of the techniques mentioned above. The serogroup O149:K91 with fimbriae F4ac (K88ac) and genes for the enterotoxins LT and STII was most prevalent. Serogroup O139:K12 with fimbriae F18ab and the gene for Stx2e was second, whereas serogroups O141ab and O141ac with fimbriae F18ac and genes for Stx2e, STII and often LT were much less prevalent. The serogroup O147:K89 with fimbriae F18ac, and genes for STIa and STII was detected for the first time in Switzerland.","1349":"Bone metabolism can be monitored in humans and several animal species in vivo by measuring enzymes and other protein products released by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. The biochemical markers of bone formation currently in use include bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and propeptides derived from the N or C terminal ends of the typ I procollagen molecule. The most useful markers of bone resorption are breakdown products of type I collagen. The oldest established method is the measurement of hydroxyproline in urine, which is not specific for bone, because it can be found in all collagen types and is also derived from diets. The measurement of collagen crosslinks, deoxypyridinoline and pyridinoline, is comparatively more specific to monitor bone resorption. Deoxypyridinoline and pyridinoline are used in human medicine for diagnosis and evaluation of bone diseases and in predicting the occurrence of fractures and rates of bone loss. The carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen, which has been used in several animal species, is also a promising bone marker. This article reviews the use of different bone markers in veterinary medicine and the possibilities for diagnosing and preventing bone diseases.","1350":"","1351":"A major problem in camel breeding in East Africa is the high mortality rate of young camel calves. The purpose of this research was to examine the quality of camel colostrum and extent of the calves passive immunization by maternal antibodies. In 31 camel birth on a ranch in Kenya, IgG concentrations in the colostrum and in the serum of the calf during the first three days of life were measured. IgG concentration in the serum of the calf reaches a maximum 24 hours after birth. In 39% of the examined calves, this maximum concentration was below 4 g\/l. In 61% of the calves, an IgG concentration of more than 4 g\/l was reached. No correlation was found between diseased animals and the IgG concentrations in the serum of the calves involved. A minor IgG concentration can be excluded as a reason for calves mortality. The high percentage of insufficient IgG concentration in the serum of the calves therefore must be caused by insufficient intake of colostrum. Future measures in order to decrease calves mortality must therefore try to improve the management of calves, especially the sufficient intake of colostrum.","1352":"Three feeding methods were compared in 36 4- to 6-year-old Franche-Montagne horses during the military school of St-Luzisteig (GR) of Spring 1992. The horses were separated into 3 groups: a group with the traditional oats-hay ration (OH), a group with a pelleted feed and hay ration (PFH), and a group with the complete diet (CD). Feed analyses were performed and food consumption, eating behavior and digestibility were studied. The horses received their daily amount of feed in 3 portions covering the requirements for a medium work: OH = 8 kg hay and 3 kg oats, PFH = 8 kg hay and 3 kg pelleted feed and CD = 10 kg of the complete diet. For the 3 rations, the amount of digestible crude protein for horses was higher than the reference value for the requirement of a 600 kg horse with a medium work. In the 3 diets, the calcium content was higher than the required 32 g per day (g\/d). Not enough sodium (OH: 1.2 g\/d; PFH: 7.3 g\/d; CD: 9.6 g\/d) and too much potassium (OH: 140.3 g\/d; PFH 153.0 g\/d; CD: 167.5 g\/d) were present in the diets, both without consequences for the blood parameters. In 3 meals of 60 minutes, the horses of the group OH, PFH and CD ingested 82%, 89% and 92%, respectively, of the daily ration. The complete diet was ingested more quickly than the hay. The number of mastications per minute was smaller for the complete diet than for the hay. Ingestion times were similar for oats and pelleted feed. However, the number of mastications per minute was smaller for the pelleted feed. The digestibility of nutrients was not influenced by the method of feeding. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the 3 types of ration studied here are adequate for the swiss army horses if sodium is added to the diet. However, despite the fact that both PFH and CD correct excessive supply or deficiencies of nutrients and despite the fact that these two feeding methods offer nutrients in amounts that are closer to the requirements of the horse, the method PFH was introduced in 1994.","1353":"","1354":"Two rare cases of a bovine listeria mastitis and a mould mastitis are being described and discussed.

Three strains from the silage and four strains from quarter milking showed an identical PFGE-pattern.","1355":null,"1356":"Bovine herpes mammillitis was diagnosed in a dairy herd with udder and teat skin lesions. Clinical symptoms seen in 6 cows consisted of round dry areas at the teats as well as large red and painful areas with crust formation at the teats, the teat basis and the udder. Diagnosis was verified by demonstrating numerous virus particles with the typical herpes structure and by BHV-2 serum neutralization test. Prevalence of BHV-2 in the herd was determined by using BHV-2 SNT at 7 occasions during a period of 15 months. The relatively low BHV-2 SNT-titres as well as the seasonal increase of BHV-2 titres and seroprevalence in the month of September were indicative of a chronic and latent BHV-2 infection in the herd.","1357":"Ehrlichiosis is a rickettsial disease of animals and humans caused by various species of Ehrlichia. These obligate intracellular microorganisms infect granulocytes or monocytes of mammalian hosts and are transmitted mostly by ticks. The febrile disease is often undiagnosed and characterized by leukopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is based on clinical findings, tick infestation, direct or indirect detection of the agent, and serology. The role of native and imported ehrlichiae of animals in Switzerland is discussed.","1358":"The article contains personal views on some issues that are frequently addressed in discussions about rabies control, and on some related topics that are often overlooked. The first field applications of oral wildlife rabies immunization in the Swiss Rhone Valley were preceded by many years of international cooperative studies on efficacy and safety. They were significant \"faits accomplis\" that facilitated similar endeavors in other countries. Some aspects of the residual pathogenicity of oral rabies vaccines are discussed. The field efficacy of oral wildlife immunization is the outcome of complex interactions between vaccine and bait attributes, bait distribution procedures, and habitat properties. Significant difficulties hinder the interpretation of field observations on efficacy. Though oral wildlife immunization is not an animal welfare act and not a conservationist achievement, it is an attempt at zoonosis control intended to protect human health and prevent economic losses.","1359":"","1360":"","1361":"Since summer 1989, rabies in Switzerland has been restricted to the Jura Mountains in the north-west of the country. Even there, the last endemic focus disappeared in 1990, but a re-infection in the same year caused a new flare-up of the epizootic. Until 1994, the number of rabies cases increased again to 225. Control measures were intensified with doubled vaccination campaigns, increased bait densities, and additional vaccination campaigns to immunize young foxes at the den. As a consequence, the number of cases dropped to 25 in 1995 and to 6 in 1996. On December 21, 1996, the last endemic case of rabies in Switzerland was registered. After two years of continuing vaccination campaigns and surveillance, Switzerland became officially rabies-free at the beginning of 1999. In the present paper, we analyse the final stage of the epizootic. The re-infection in 1990 was caused by infected foxes immigrating from France, but as the immunization of the fox population in Switzerland was insufficient, the disease became again endemic immediately. The lacking herd immunity was partly a consequence of problems related to the vaccination system and even more of the rapid increase of the fox population.","1362":"Preconditions for successful field application of the idea to orally immunize foxes against rabies were a) the development of an efficacious and safe vaccine and an attractive bait and b) a suitable strategy to reach a high proportion of the vector population with vaccine-ladden baits. A geographical and epidemiological concept on how to implement the vaccination strategy and how to achieve a sufficiently high level of surveillance were further cornerstones contributing to the success of the method. Finally, political decisions and a legal basis for the application of the method of oral immunization were required to eradicate fox rabies in Switzerland.","1363":"The rabies epidemic that reached Switzerland in 1967 developed in response to landscape factors as long as no efficient control strategies were available. The landscape acted either as barrier to the spread of rabies, or it influenced the density of red foxes and thus the habitat of the epidemic. Following the first cases in the canton of Schaffhausen, the whole northwestern Switzerland was infected followed by the eastern Alps, large parts of the Plateau and the Jura mountains. In 1978, in the canton of Valais, the first campaigns of oral immunization of foxes against rabies started. The design of vaccination campaigns during the next two decades was always closely linked to landscape features. Thus, it was possible to free first the Alps and then the Plateau from rabies and finally, at the end of the 1990s, to eliminate it completely within the country. We describe the entire development of the epidemic within the period of 30 years from the first infection up to the last registered case and the final vaccination campaign.","1364":"The European fox rabies epizootic starting in 1939 at the eastern border of Poland reached Switzerland on March 3, 1967. Rabies spread over large parts of the country until 1977, the year it caused three human deaths. In 1978 the first field trial world-wide for the oral immunization of foxes against rabies was conducted in Switzerland. Initially, the expansion of the vaccination area led to a rapid reduction in rabies cases. However, the 1990s were characterized by a recrudescence of rabies in spite of regular oral immunization of foxes. The last endemic case of rabies was diagnosed in 1996 after an adaptation of the vaccination strategy. A total of 17,109 rabies cases, of which 73% in foxes and 14% in domestic animals were diagnosed, leading to an estimated number of some 25,000 postexposure treatments in humans. To eliminate rabies, a total of 2.8 million baits containing a modified live virus were distributed--mostly by hand--in the field.","1365":"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrinopathies in the dog and cat. Diabetic cataract primarily affects the canine species and is rarely observed in the cat. It has been proposed that the incidence of cataracts in diabetic dogs is high because many of these patients have significant hyperglycemia despite insulin therapy. Age, gender, levels of serum glucose (before and during insulin therapy) and cataract formation were evaluated, retrospectively, in 23 dogs and 22 cats with diabetes mellitus. In the canine population, the groups with the highest frequency of presentation were females and sexually intact animals. In contrast, males and neutered animals were the most prevalent groups in the feline diabetic population. Over 80% of diabetic cats and dogs were older than 7 years. Our results confirm the almost total lack of cataracts in diabetic cats, while they were present in more than half of the dogs. A relation between the incidence of cataracts and the correspondent level of hyperglycemia in the canine and feline species could not be established. The estimation of the relative risk for the development of cataracts in diabetic dogs shows that some population groups have a higher probability for suffering from this ocular alteration. A relation between relative risk and the correspondent level of hyperglycemia in the various groups was not found. This fact indicates that other factors are involved in the unequal appearance of diabetic cataracts in dogs and cats.","1366":"A continuous increase in the circumference of the thyroid gland was observed in four goat kids (44.4%) of the breed of White German Goat between the third and fourth month in a herd comprising White German Goats and Coloured German Goats. Clinical, laboratory diagnostic and chemically analytical results have been obtained, illustrated and compared with the equivalent parameters from healthy control herds without pathological findings. The thyroidal secretion rate and the milk iodine content were highly significant reduced in the affected flock in comparison with the control group. The feed which was given to the affected group did not cover the nutritional requirement of pregnant, lactating and growing goats. At 40-50 mg\/l, the nitrate content of the water was close to the tolerance of 50 mg\/l. It can be deduced from the findings available that the case described above is a synergetic combination of a primary iodine deficiency, based on an inefficient iodine supply and of a secondary iodine deficiency resulting from a super elevated nitrate content of the drinking water.","1367":"Enzootic calcinosis was diagnosed in 16 cows, which originated from 6 dairy farms located in the Unterengadin valley in Switzerland between 1,402 and 1,650 metres above sea level. During the winter, the cows were fed haylage, which contained up to 50 per cent golden oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens), and hay and grain. The first symptoms of enzootic calcinosis were noted in March 1998, when some of the cows developed locomotor abnormalities. Additional cases were diagnosed during the following three months. The most important clinical findings were decreased milk production, weight loss, frequent recumbency, difficulty in rising, kneeling while rising and feeding, stilted gait, arched back, shifting weight from one foot to another and reluctance to remain standing after being roused. Of the 16 cows, 5 had elevated concentrations of serum calcium and 10 had decreased concentrations of serum magnesium. All cows had normal or decreased concentrations of serum phosphorus, because the feeding of haylage containing golden oat-grass had been discontinued two months previously. In all of the cows, the most important postmortem findings were severe calcification of the aorta, iliac artery, brachiocephalic trunk and pulmonary artery.","1368":"Animals poisoned by plants are the subject of an increasing number of inquiries made to poison control centres. The most frequent questions are concerned with the identification of potentially toxic species and the choice of adequate therapeutic strategies. To meet this growing demand for information, we generated a database on poisonous plants to be used by veterinary practitioners. Relevant data were selected from the scientific literature and organised according to the requirements of a structured database. As a result, we now introduce a user-friendly decision support system that is equipped with several search functions for fast and efficient retrieval of data. The information provided for each plant includes the degree of toxicity, major toxic constituents, their mechanism of action, pathological findings, clinical symptoms with brief case reports, therapeutic guidelines and references. In addition, each species is accompanied by a botanical description with photographic illustrations. This information tool on poisonous plants is available via the internet (http:www.vetpharm.unizh.ch) or compact disc, and can be accessed on Macintosh, Windows or UNIX using a browser that supports HTML 3.","1369":"","1370":"","1371":"","1372":"","1373":"","1374":"Clinical findings in fifteen dogs with tricuspid valve dysplasia are described.

In 14 dogs, right heart enlargement was suspected on thoracic radiographs and electrocardiography. Right atrial dilation was seen echocardiographically in all dogs. Fourteen dogs had additional right ventricular dilatation, some with hypertrophy as well. Doppler echocardiography revealed tricuspid valve regurgitation. Seven dogs remained free of clinical symptoms to date. If symptoms of decompensation develop with tricuspid dysplasia, diuretics, ACE inhibitors and eventually positive inotrope drugs are indicated. Antiarrhythmic drugs may become necessary in cases of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.","1375":"Nonylphenol is a biodegradation product of a widely used group of non-ionic detergents. Because of its ubiquitous distribution and persistence, nonylphenol is present in surface waters as a pollutant. Little is known about its biological effects at environmentally relevant concentrations other than its action as a xenoestrogen. The goal of the present paper was to study the trout gill surface epithelium as the major interface between fish and water in view of possible morphological alterations due to exposure to nonylphenol. Rainbow trout were intermittently exposed to 10 micrograms\/l nonylphenol and gill samples from experimental and control animals were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Gill surface epithelium was scrutinised for changes in chloride cell density and their status regarding cell surface modifications. In addition, chloride cell fractional surface area (CCFA) was determined by morphometrical methods. Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant increase of CCFA in animals exposed to nonylphenol as compared to control animals (P = 0.0001). Semi-quantitative assessment of the other parameters suggested a higher chloride cell density and a larger proportion of chloride cells bearing microvilli. Taken together, these results provide evidence that exposure of trout to nonylphenol is associated with a substantial increase in the active interface of chloride cells with water. We interpret these findings as being a means to further the fish's capacity for calcium exchange.","1376":"","1377":"","1378":"","1379":"","1380":"","1381":"","1382":"The intake of colostrum in newborn calves not only influences the immune status, but also the development of the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, metabolism and endocrine systems.

The birds cause an immense faecal contamination of the park and the neighbouring district. A nursery and a primary school are directly affected. To evaluate the health risk coming from the starlings droppings for the population, particularly for the children and to assess the role of starlings in the transmission of diseases to humans and in the epidemiology of human diseases the presence of human bacterial pathogens in the faeces of starlings was determined. Some of the isolated strains were further typed and compared to strains of human origin. C. jejuni, L. monocytogenes and C. psittaci were most often found. The typing of some C. jejuni and L. monocytogenes isolates showed a great variety of geno-, sero- respectively phage types that did not belong to the strains most often found in isolates of human origin. Starlings can harbour human pathogens and therefore a potential risk of infection comes from their droppings. It seems however rather improbable, that these birds present a constant direct source of infection for human beings.","1392":"Maedi-Visna is a lentiviral disease of sheep with a worldwide distribution. The transmission of the virus occurs primarily via colostrum and milk from the infected ewe to its newborn lamb but also horizontally between sheep. The most obvious clinical symptoms are progressive dyspnea and emaciation. In this prospective study an eradication based on serological testing and removing of seropositive animals was performed in 24 flocks of sheep of the breed \"Walliser Schwarznasenschafe\" leading to a reduction of the seroprevalence from 36% to 1% within two years. The control group consisted of 21 flocks of sheep. Lambs of seropositive ewes had a 7.6 times higher risk to seroconvert within their first two years of life compared to those of seronegative ewes. The dynamics of the spread of the infection were studied in birth cohort groups. Cohort animals of seropositive ewes showed an obvious trend to seroconvert slowly. Seropositive ewes had a significantly lower reproduction rate and their lambs suffered from significantly higher death and lower growth rates, probably due to a reduced milk production, resulting in economic losses.","1393":null,"1394":"Molecular markers allow a characterization of animal populations on DNA level. They help to estimate the genetic variability, they are useful in paternity control, to diagnose hereditary diseases, in epidemiology and last but not least support traditional tools to take breeding decisions. Seventy-six new-world camelids in Switzerland were genetically typed for six microsatellite markers and their parentage controlled. Calculation of allele frequencies, heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and exclusion probability of markers showed a high genetic variability within the chosen populations. This will allow selection for certain traits. The estimated genetic distance between different camelid species and breeds was in accordance with their expected phylogenetic origins.","1395":"In this study the distribution of the various antigenic types of canine parvovirus in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany was investigated. From 14 samples from Switzerland, 35 samples from Austria, and 82 samples from Germany exclusively the new antigenic types CPV-2a and CPV-2b were isolated. Most of these isolates had a Ser-Val mutation at amino acid 297, which was shown to be prevalent in recent CPV isolates from various parts of the world. These findings are discussed with regard to the use of modified live virus vaccines.","1396":"Fecal samples from 544 beef cattle and 140 sheep were investigated by PCR for verotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) without and with an enrichment step. 6.1% (after enrichment 14%) of cattle samples and 10% (after enrichment 29.2%) of sheep samples were VT-PCR-positive. Moreover, a noticeable age-depending prevalence in cattle was found. Eleven VTEC strains isolated from fecal samples of 5 cattle and 6 sheep were taken for further characterization. None of the strains belonged to serogroup O157. But, as reported previously, we also found in this study strains with virulence genes that are associated with increased pathogenicity. The importance of slaughter hygiene and of bacteriological monitoring of carcass contamination has to be pointed out.","1397":"Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are phenotypically and phylogenetically closely related cyst-forming coccidia, both of which may cause abortion in livestock animals. T. gondii exhibits also zoonotic potential by causing diaplacental infections in the human fetus and harmful infections in immunosuppressed individuals. Humans get infected either by consuming inappropriately prepared cyst-containing meat or by ingesting oocysts originating from cat feces. Therefore, in order to assess infection risk we need to have knowledge on the prevalence of the parasite in consumable meat and thus slaughtered animals. So far, no data indicate any zoonotic potential for N. caninum. Due to its high economic impact in the bovine production in Switzerland, we included this parasite in the present study as well. The prevalence of both parasite species were investigated by PCR in muscle and brain samples of slaughtered bovines, sheep, pigs and horses. Comparatively, a serum sample from each animal was simultaneously tested serologically by a Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA and a Neospora-SA-ELISA. The prevalences determined by the T. gondii-PCR were the followings: adult cows 3%, young bulls 2%, young cows prior to gravidity 6%, calves 1%, sheep 6%, horses and pigs each 0%. For N. caninum, the PCR-prevalence was 2% for adult cows and 0% for all other animal groups. Conversely, the seroprevalences were much higher for both parasite species and all animal groups, with the exception of the fattening pigs. However, as T. gondii was principally detectable in bovine (cows and calves) as well as in sheep meat, the consumption of this meat harbours a potential infection risk for humans. In contrast, the lack of any parasite detectability in fattening pig and horse meat allows to consider this infection source as neglectable when compared to bovine and ovine meat.","1398":"We are solving disputed paternities in purebred dogs using microsatellite analysis. An interesting case involved four puppies for which pedigrees were already issued by the Swiss Kennel Club. The investigation had to be carried out without a sample from the stated sire. Even though the relationship of this sire could not be determined conclusively, comparison of microsatellite alleles within this family, including an alleged half-brother of the four puppies, showed clearly that the breeder had made contradictory statements and that false recordings of matings had occurred. The pedigrees for these four puppies were withdrawn and sanctions against the breeder were imposed.","1399":"One hundred and ninety-eight dairy herds in which an abortion problem had been investigated by laboratory examination alone or in conjunction with a farm visit were reassessed via a questionnaire at least 1 year after the initial investigation. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 78%, but more owners responded after a farm visit. One hundred and twenty-five questionnaires (63%) could be evaluated. Significantly more (p = 0.01) complete or tentative diagnoses were made in herds that were visited. The abortion problem had resolved in 88%, 79% and 88% of herds with a complete, a tentative and no diagnosis, respectively. In 65% of herds, the suggested control measures were followed by the attending veterinarian or the owner. Resolution of the abortion problem was more common in herds in which the proposed control measures were followed, in herds in which a complete diagnosis had been made, and in herds that had been visited during the initial investigation. The success in resolving the abortion problem, that could be attributed to the initial investigation, was 21% when a complete diagnosis had been made and 11% when only a tentative diagnosis had been made. Most (67%) herd owners would favour an accompanying farm visit, as opposed to laboratory examinations alone, if another abortion problem occurred, but only if a considerable portion of the cost could be deferred.","1400":"Hirsutism was the most often observed symptom in horses with a pituitary gland tumor and was present in all 13 examined horses.

Laminitis was the most frequently observed concurrent disease (n = 8). Hyperglycaemia (mean, 9.9 +\/- 3.71 mmol\/l) in 13 horses and glucosuria (median, 55 [range, 2-55] mmol\/l) in 7 horses were the most important laboratory results. The dexamethasone suppression test was positive in all tested horses (n = 9) 20 h after administration of dexamethasone. The pituitary gland tumor was visible in every case underwent computed tomography (n = 7). From these results it can be concluded that a pituitary gland tumor can be suspected based on typical clinical signs. Hyperglycaemia and glucosuria support the preliminary diagnosis and a positive dexamethasone suppression test allows a final diagnosis.","1401":"","1402":"","1403":"","1404":"","1405":"Nine pigs with acute erysipelas in skin manifestation have been subjected in 1998 to a bacteriological examination.

No positive titers were observed in animals between five weeks and four months of age. In order to avoid false negative results only sera from untreated gilts should be used. The high specificity (99.34%) of the test calculated in a previous study (Zimmermann und Kircher, 1998) is confirmed by these results.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the system for long term monitoring of health data. For this purpose, the quality of the collected data and the acceptance of the system by farmers and veterinarians were investigated. Farmers recorded all health events using a form. Collected data was entered into a central database on a monthly basis. The recording of health data was easy to do and did not take a lot of time. Most of the farmers (89%) used less than 20 minutes per week for the recording. This time need was independent of the herd size. 66% of the farmers found it useful to record health data, especially for improving their overview on health of each single cow. Treatments were reported in 81% of the cases, inseminations and calving in 80% of the cases.

A serosurvey using an ELISA was performed to investigate infections with ND-Virus (NDV) in 260 Swiss laying hen flocks, 169 backyard poultry flocks and 1576 wild birds. For laying hen flocks, a stochastic model was applied to analyse the results from serological testing. Four laying hen flocks were identified as NDV-seropositive, and the true NDV seroprevalence in this population was most likely between 1.3 and 1.5%. NDV antibodies were also detected in five of the 169 backyard poultry-flocks. ND-antibody positive birds were found in 10% of all wild birds examined, with the highest proportions among cormorants, grebes, birds of prey, owls, and swifts. The study indicated that positive flocks must have been in contact with NDV strains causing sub-clinical infection, since no clinical signs had been observed. Moreover, trade of poultry or poultry eggs was considered to be an important factor associated with seropositivity in backyard poultry flocks. Contact to wild birds did not seem to be of major importance.","1409":"Borna disease (BD) is a rare immunopathological disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by infection with Borna disease virus (BDV) and histologically characterized by mononuclear encephalomyelitis.

In general, such animals do not have lesions that are visible during meat inspection. Pigs are considered to be carriers of salmonella, yersinia and mycobacteria, but the risk of transmission to humans is difficult to assess. The aim of this study was to estimate the actual prevalence of the three above mentioned pathogens in the Swiss pig population and to comment on their significance. A total of 570 samples each of tonsils and mesenteric lymphnodes, were collected at two slaughterhouses from carcasses of apparently healthy pigs and analyzed for the presence of salmonella, yersinia and mycobacteria. The prevalence of salmonella (0.9%) was found to be lower than--while that of yersinia (8.1%) and mycobacteria (12.8%) about equal to--results reported from other European countries. Yersinia typing showed that serotype O:9 of Yersinia enterocolitica (2.5%) was 6 to 7 times more frequent than serotype O:3 (0.4%)--formerly the most frequent serotype. Mycobacterium avium was the most frequent isolate (90.7%) among the mycobacteria isolated. Although all three pathogens are present in the Swiss pig population, we consider the risk of transmission to humans via consumption of pork as low. Appropriate preventive measures and quality management should contribute to keep the risk under control.","1412":"The clinical features of the disease are presented based on retrospective analysis of the records of eleven dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis using clinical signs and results of the microagglutination test (MAT) between 1991 and 1996. Additionally, Leptospira titres were determined in 30 healthy dogs and 20 hospitalised dogs without clinical or laboratory evidence of leptospirosis. A positive titre for L. grippotyphosa, L. pomona, L. bratislava, L. australis, L. icterohaemorrhagiae and\/or L. canicola was found in 16 normal dogs and only one hospitalised patient. Eight of these dogs had titres of &gt; or = 1:800. Only one of them had been vaccinated shortly before sampling. These results suggest that many dogs from the surroundings of Bern, Switzerland have contact with various Leptospira interrogans serovars. In ten healthy dogs, the Leptospira titre was determined before and four weeks after vaccination with leptospiral antigen. Only two of the dogs showed a serologically measurable response to the antigen contained in the vaccine. In dogs MAT titers presumably do not reliably reflect the immune status against leptospiral infections.","1413":"A 12-year old Simmental x Red Holstein cow was admitted to the clinic eight months after an eye laceration followed by eye extirpation. The region of the excised eye had healed, however, the cow had additional trigeminal and facial nerve palsy. Nevertheless, the cow was in good general condition, and therefore, was sent home without therapy. After delivering a sound calf, her physical condition deteriorated and she was slaughtered. Histologic examination of the brain revealed degeneration of the right optic nerve and right half of the chiasma opticum as well as left tractus opticus (opposite side); furthermore, degenerative changes with slight inflammation of the right vestibular nuclei were observed. Possible pathogenesis is discussed.","1414":"In this report, the case of a 2-month-aged female lamb with obstructive urolithiasis, caused by calculi consisting of calcium-phosphate (apatite), is described. Urolithiasis as an often occurring problem in male sheep rarely emerges in female individuals. This lies mainly on the differences in anatomy between male and female urogenital apparatus. The account of diagnosis, therapy and clinical course in that special case are discussed, along with possible causes of the disease, the etiopathogenesis and recommended prophylactic steps.","1415":"Chronic osteoarthritis of the metacarpophalangeal joint is predominantly observed in working dogs. Surgical intervention is often required to maintain a functional limb. Excision arthroplasty represents a simple, relatively quick and cosmetically esthetic alternative to arthrodesis, endoprosthesis or amputation. In the present study, the technique of excision arthroplasty is described and discussed as a treatment method for chronic osteoarthritis of the metacarpophalangeal joint.","1416":"Sporadic cases of infection with Mycoplasma bovis have been observed in Switzerland since 1983. However, five severe outbreaks of endemic mastitis in a geographically distinct, small region (Canton du Jura) during the period 1995 to 1997 prompted the present investigation on the seroprevalence of infection with M. bovis among milking cows in Switzerland. A commercially prepared indirect enzyme immunoassay was used. Among a stratified random sample of 118 herds of milking cows in Switzerland, at least one positive animal was detected in 56 (47%) of the herds, whereas 6.1% of the 1816 individual animals tested positive. An epidemiological study was performed in the Canton du Jura region among 51 herds in order to assess the importance of management factors in the spread of M. bovis infection. The herd-level prevalence was 78%, and the seroprevalence at the level of the 1354 individual animals tested was 13.4%. A multivariate analysis of possible risk factors showed purchase of animals to be the only variable significantly associated with serological status of the herd with an \"odds ratio\" of 10.8.","1417":"The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of cecal dilatation\/dislocation (CDD) and abomasal displacement (DA) in Switzerland, to identify risk factors for both diseases, and to compare directly their epidemiologic situation. The epidemiologic study included 158 cases of CDD and 149 cases of DA from the cases referred to both University Clinics of Berne and Zurich. The results showed that DA was associated with nutrition-related risk factors: use of minerals and sodium chloride, inadequate concentrate feeding and beginning of the feeding. Furthermore, breed was significantly associated with DA, but not with CDD. Finally, milk yield and pasture were also significantly included in the models. For CDD, nutrition-related risk factors were also found: pasture in summer, use of corn pellets and corn silage in winter. In the final model, protein concentrate was also included. Although both diseases were found at comparable frequencies, the results of this study indicate marked differences between the epidemiology of occurrence of CDD and DA. Therefore, the hypothesis of a common etiopathogenesis appears unlikely.","1418":"This paper describes the latest results of research in the areas of etiopathogenesis and treatment of cecal dilatation\/-dislocation (CDD) in cows. Similar etiopathogenic mechanisms of CDD and displacement of the abomasum, as has been hypothesized in the literature, were not confirmed. Spontaneous CDD is most likely the consequence of a dysfunction of the spiral colon. Bethanechol is an appropriate motility-modulating drug for medical and postsurgical treatment of spontaneous CDD.","1419":"The records of 106 cases of right-sided displacement of the abomasum (RDA) and abomasal volvulus (AV) were reviewed. Pre- and postoperative heart rate (&gt; or = 90 BPM), serum BUN (&gt; or = 10 mmol\/L), potassium (&lt; or = 3.3 mmol\/L) and chloride (&lt; or = 85 mmol\/L) were the best indicators for a non-productive outcome. High gamma-GT activity can be used as a preoperative indicator to differentiate AV from RDA. The overall rate of return to a productive life was 74% (81.2% of RDA cases and 67.3% of AV cases).","1420":"Calves with chronic indigestion have disturbed general attitude and condition, decreased appetite, loss of hair, clay-like faeces and ruminal and metabolic acidosis. Possible causes include dysfunction of the oesophageal-groove reflex, reflux of abomasal contents into the rumen and abnormal ruminal motility. The anion gap may be increased or within normal limits. Metabolic acidosis is significantly more severe in calves that are unable to stand than in calves that can stand. Treatment of chronic indigestion consists primarily of intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate, transfaunation of the rumen and oral administration of electrolyte solutions.","1421":"This paper describes the technique of laparoscopy in cows. The laparoscopic anatomy of healthy cows is described with the laparoscope introduced through the left and right flank in the standing animal and through the ventral aspect of the abdomen with the animal positioned in dorsal recumbency. The case reports and the corresponding laparoscopic findings of 4 cows suffering from an intraabdominal problem are additionally presented.","1422":"This paper presents a review of the pathogenesis of abdominal pain in ruminants, the complete clinical examination of animals with colic and the symptomatology of the different conditions producing abdominal pain. Further diagnostic procedures such as abdominal ultrasonography, explorative laparotomy and diagnostic laparoscopy are discussed.","1423":"This case report is about a 9 year old female spayed domestic shorthair cat with a previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus. After an insulin treatment for a short period of time, the cat was given an oral hypoglycemic agent. Four years after initiating therapy the cat was presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. Various aspects of the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are discussed.","1424":"466 sheep sera out of 19 flocks in Switzerland were examined by a competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for antibodies against Chlamydia psittaci \"serotype 1\" (\"ovine enzootic abortion\"). Since numerous positive reactors were found in flocks without abortion history, 30 fecal samples out of two of these flocks were examined by PCR for evidence of chlamydial DNA. One of these samples turned out to contain DNA of Chlamydia psittaci \"serotype 1\". These results suggest, that in Switzerland \"serotype 1\" of Chlamydia psittaci is widespread not only as cause of chlamydial abortion but also as latent intestinal infection in sheep. The resulting difficulties for serological diagnosis of chlamydial abortion and possible solutions based on the cELISA are discussed. The complement fixation test (CFT), still considered as standard method for serological examination for Chlamydiae, has additionally been applied.","1425":"Based on an intensive analysis of literature, the study summarizes for the first time important but seldom realized reasons for dog keeping by humans. Firstly, the significance of the companion animal domesticated dog as catalyst of numerous different social contacts and communicative interactions of the dog keepers is emphasized. Secondly, the problem of total devotion of dog owners to the animal is discussed including its negative aspects, and the psychogram of a \"typical dog owner\" is described. Thirdly, the role of the domesticated dog as object of body contact (petting object) for humans is characterized, i.e., the positive effects of tactile stimuli for the emotional and physical well-being of dog owners as well as their animals are presented. All themes are finally discussed in the light of the historical dimension of dog domestication, whereby it is obvious that one of the first uses of this mammalian species was that as an object of affectional touch and hugging to serve basic human emotional needs. In this way it becomes also evident how deeply the dog depends on its owner.","1426":"A 9 1\/2 month old female Basenji is presented with problems of house soiling and anxiety. The case is assessed by means of a questionnaire and observation. It is diagnosed as a deprivation syndrome, caused by insufficient conditions during puppyhood. A combination therapy consisting of propranolol medication and relaxation exercises is only partially successful. The influence of factors from the dogs living environment is discussed.","1427":"Each year approximately 13,000 new pedigrees for puppies are issued by the Swiss Kennel Club Except for a few cases there are no regulations to verify the paternities independently. This report describes the practical procedure for disputed paternities and summarizes the results from 35 cases which were resolved during the last three years. Most cases relate to unwanted or wanted double matings. Generally the owner of the bitch can not state the sire. For roughly half of the cases where a sire was given as the parent the information was disproven by the genetic analysis in the laboratory. These experiences confirm the need for a better pedigree control in Swiss dog breeds. Breeding without correct pedigree control is restricted to animal keeping.","1428":"Increasing is the number of Llamas (Llama glama) referred to veterinarians for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures which frequently require sedation or anaesthesia. Much of the knowledge concerning sedation and anaesthesia of domesticated ruminants and horses can be applied to sedate or anaesthetise a llama. A variety of considerations remain special for the llama. The article reviews all aspects of today's knowledge about sedation and anaesthesia of llamas.","1429":"In total, 63 S. aureus strains from mastitis milk samples of different animals in 57 farms were isolated. In 14 (22%) of the S. aureus strains resistancies against one or several of the examined antibiotics could be observed whereby six resistance patterns were found. 14.3% of the strains were penicillin resistant. 34 (54%) of the 63 S. aureus produced enterotoxins (SE). Three strains formed SEA, 21 SEC, three SED and seven strains 2 SE, SEAC, SEAD or SEBD.","1430":"In a 7 year old female poodle an adrenocortical tumor was diagnosed on basis of laboratory and ultrasonographic examinations. One year after adrenalectomy, a relapse was diagnosed, at that time the suspicion of metastases in the liver arose for the first time. By treatment with Mitotane in a dose aiming at completely destroying the adrenal cortex, a complete disappearance of the tumor as well as a dramatic reduction of the size of the metastases could be achieved. 12 months after the begin of the chemotherapy, the dog is in good general condition.","1431":"In a retrospective study, we compared the abortion rates of 59 cows in the second half of gestation, admitted to the Clinic for Food Animals and Horses (1993-1996) with a strictly focal problem (head region, udder and teats, locomotor system) requiring surgery in lateral recumbency, to the abortion rate of a control cow population. Before surgery, a uterus relaxant was given in 42 cases, and 17 cows were untreated as to pregnancy. Cows included in the reproduction health program of the Department of Fertility and Reproduction were used as a control population. Data of 1,736 cows pregnant in the second half of gestation per year were available for the same time period (1993-1996). Abortion rate was 5.08% for the cows undergoing surgery in lateral recumbency as compared with 5.18% for the cows of the control population. There was no significant difference between the two populations (P &gt; 0.05). Thus, the risk for abortion in the cows in question is not elevated as compared with the control population.","1432":null,"1433":"The effect of mitotane therapy on adrenal gland size was evaluated in 13 dogs with pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Ultrasonographic measurements were obtained before and during mitotane therapy. During therapy both adrenal glands were shorter and thinner (median during therapy: left adrenal gland 19.4 mm long, 5.4 mm thick, right adrenal gland 18.1 mm long, 6.1 mm thick) than before mitotane therapy (median before therapy: left adrenal gland 23.6 mm long, 8.3 mm thick, right adrenal gland 21.6 mm long, 8.1 mm thick). Statistical evaluation showed a significant reduction in size. But ultrasonographic measurement of adrenal gland size is not useful in the evaluation of adrenal reserve during mitotane therapy. Inadequate adrenal reserve was not identified and adrenal size measurement by ultrasonography was not helpful to differentiate adequate and inadequate control of adrenal cortisol secretion during mitotane therapy.","1434":"The records of 25 Golden Retrievers with idiopathic epilepsy were reviewed. One goal was to identify objective aspects enabling a realistic prognosis prior to treatment. In half the dogs seizures occurred for the first time at the age of one to three years and were mostly generalised. The character, feeding habits and confinement of the dogs played a minor role in the clinical manifestation of the fits, but they were seen mostly during sleep in two thirds of the dogs. Because of the long follow-up period some important findings were made. At the beginning of the standardized long-term therapy with phenobarbital a success was observed in two thirds of the dogs, while after four years the symptoms worsened significantly in about half the dogs. We found no better success rate in castrated dogs. Dogs responded well to therapy if treated as early as possible.","1435":"Polyomavirus infections in budgerigars, in other parrots as well as in passeriformes have been described in many countries, but not in Switzerland so far. This paper reports on cases of polyomavirus infections in three different bird collections in Switzerland. The first outbreak occurred in a mixed collection of passeriformes, the second in a collection of parrotlets (Genus Forpus), and the third in a large groups of parrots (Psittaciformes), of which only one recently acquired Kea (Nestor notabilis) was affected. The clinical symptoms, gross necropsy changes and histopathologic findings are described. The presence of avian polyomavirus was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).","1436":"A trial was carried out on a beef cattle farm to obtain efficacy data for the treatment of naturally occurring bronchopneumonia in calves under commercial production conditions. The treatment was administered by medicating milk with three different tilmicosin doses mixed in the first 80% of the daily milk ration. According to the clinical results, all three treatment regimens proved to be effective. The efficacies of the reduced dose of 12.5 mg tilmicosin\/kg body weight daily for 5 days and of the reduced treatment duration with 25 mg\/kg b.w. daily for 3 days were equivalent to a previously proven dose of 25 mg\/kg b.w. daily for 5 days.","1437":"An eight-month-old female rottweiler was presented with a history of intermittent lameness of the right hindlimb of 4 weeks duration. Radiographs showed a fragmentation in two plantar sesamoid bones of the metatarsophalangeal joint. Based on these clinical and radiographic signs sesamoid disease of the 2nd and 7th sesamoid bone in the right hindpaw was diagnosed. The fragmented sesamoids were surgically removed and histologically examined. The treatment was successful and the dog became lamnessfree. Additional radiographs showed fragmentations of sesamoid bones VII of both the forepaws, but they did not cause any lameness.","1438":"Non-surgical occlusion of persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) by catheter guided coil embolisation was performed in two dogs. In both dogs the procedure was performed through the femoral artery. The exact location and the narrowest diameter of the PDA were evaluated angiographically after contrast medium injection into the ascending aorta. Based on shunt diameter measurements of 4 mm in dog no. 1 and 2.4 mm in dog no. 2, a coil of 8 mm diameter was chosen for dog no. 1, and of 5 mm diameter for dog no. 2. The coils were placed within the shunt vessel under fluoroscopic guidance using the Cook delivery-system for detachable PDA coil. The success of the intervention was documented angiographically 10 minutes after coil release. The shunt vessel was completely occluded in dog no. 1, while minimal blood flow was detected in dog no. 2 at that time. The technique of transvascular PDA closure compares favorably with the traditional surgical technique due to minimal invasiveness and hence excellent postinterventional comfort to the patient.","1439":"In May 1998, wild boars with classical swine fever (CSF) symptoms were detected in the southern part (Canton Ticino) of Switzerland. CSF virus was isolated from the submitted samples and RT-PCR followed by direct nucleotide sequencing of the 5' non-translated region showed that this virus was identical to the isolate previously recognized in wild boars from the area of Varese (Italy). In most animals, antibodies to CSF virus were detected as well. An immediate measurement was taken by limiting the movement of pigs and identifying both risk and surveillance zones. In order not to disturb potentially infected wild boars within their habitat a complete hunting prohibition for 2 months was enforced. The different possibilities of the control of CSF outbreaks in wild boars are discussed.","1440":"Milk that cannot be brought to the market is often given to calves. While some authors recommend avoidance of the feeding of such milk, others do not see problems related to their use if this milk is treated and supplemented correctly. When altered milk is fed, the producer of calves is responsible for the risk that the calf could contract a disease and to a lesser extent that the health of the consumer of veal could be endangered. Because the owner of the calves is responsible for the risk associated with the feeding of altered milk, he should be informed on the danger and consequences. The consumer whose wishes control the market wants a product that is free from bacteria and drugs. Therefore, the necessity exists for the implementation of similar withdrawal times for the use of altered milk in calves. Two questions related to public health are asked to the veterinarians:how long the flora of the gastrointestinal tract of the calf remains affected after feeding of altered milk and how long antimicrobials can be detected in the edible tissues of the calves? If these questions are answered, guidelines for the use of mastitis milk could be used.","1441":"A high frequency of diseases in the veal industry is caused by diseases which are induced by several factors which are caused or at least influenced by errors of management. In order to comply with the political goal of a diminution of the use of antimicrobials in the veal industry (ban of growth promoters), errors of housing and of nutrition, damaging influences of the microclimate and hazardous commercial substances should be eliminated. Further measures of prophylaxis are discussed.","1442":"First, it is mentioned that the health status of the population of Swiss swines is very good in comparison to other nations due to the activity of the pig health service (PHS) and that in many places the conditions for a reduction of the use of antimicrobials are already there. Then, the activity of the PHS is described. Its success is base on the obstinate implementation of the eradication programs which are already widely used at the present time in several regions of Switzerland and which have attracted interested specialized practitioners. How the renouncement of the use of antimicrobial growth promoters will affect PHS and non PHS herds remains to be determined. A special paragraph lists the reasons why practitioners often have only little access to swine herds. One reason is the lack of competence. This problem should be solved by an intensification of the graduate and postgraduate education. Finally, the argument for a valorization of an applied and problem-oriented research at the faculties should be put forward.","1443":"Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in food may only be present in concentrations below a toxicologically approved level. To check the established limits laboratories depend on reliable methods: on the one hand rapid and inexpensive screening tests (biological and immunological methods), on the other hand rather costly but very specific chemical-analytical reference methods. The results of residue testing in a big slaughter plant are presented. Residues of antibiotics were mainly found in calves. The most frequently detected drugs were tetracyclines, sulfonamides and aminoglycosides.","1444":"The general ban of antimicrobial growth promoters seems reasonable and desirable to consumers, but is nevertheless problematic in a veterinary medical and political perspective. Rational risk management would imply that restrictive government decisions are evidence-based and provide the consumer with a higher safety level. The recent decision of the European Commission to ban avoparcin from the market was explicitly not based on scientific evidence, and apart from temporarily reducing consumer fears, the risk balance could even turn negative. The prejudicial nature of the avoparcin ban may encourage far reaching governmental interference on the market leading to the withdrawal of therapeutically important veterinary drugs on the basis of suspected side effects alone. Rational risk management would call for balancing the elimination of risks with the risks of elimination.","1445":"Already fifty years ago, when antibiotics were introduced, their effectiveness was challenged by certain bacteria which had the ability to resist the bacteriocidal effect of the antibiotics. Development of such resistance is due to selection pressure that results from the use of antibiotics in therapy, particularly in human medicine. In Switzerland, the veterinary public health aspect of this problem has become of current interest. The ban on the use of growth promoters has triggered the need for an update of the statistical information on the phenomena of resistance and the setting up of a surveillance system of antibioresistance in animals and in products of animal origin.","1446":"Since January 1st 1999 the use of antimicrobial growth promoters is forbidden in Switzerland. In a short review, the history of the utilisation of these substances, their effects in animal nutrition and the mode of action are described. The consequences of the prohibition are in part higher use of important antibiotics in prophylaxis and therapy.","1447":"","1448":"Cyst-forming coccidia may cause significant losses in livestock, primarily due to abortion, loss of young animals and neuromuscular diseases. Rather recently, Neospora caninum has been recognized as one of the major protozoal abortion-inducing parasites in cattle. The present study addressed the performance of different diagnostic tools (in vitro-cultivation; histology; immunohistochemistry; serology; PCR) suitable for the direct or indirect detection of N. caninum. By PCR, Neospora-DNA was detected in 24 brains (29%) from 83 bovine abortion, many of these brains were simultaneously characterized by histopathological findings typical for a protozoal, cerebral parasitosis. The diagnostic methods were furthermore assessed using samples of different tissues and body fluids from three experimentally Neospora-infected pregnant cows and their foetuses. The diaplacental passage of N. caninum to the foetus was successful in two of the three cases. In these two cases, PCR was positive for different foetal organs and, additionally, for the abomasal and amniotic fluid. The successfully infected cows developed anti-Neospora serum antibodies between 10 and 17 days post infection, foetuses remained serologically negative in all cases. The results obtained in the present study demonstrated the usefulness of PCR, complemented by serology, for the specific diagnosis of bovine neosporosis. Such tests may prove suitable to perform epidemiological investigations. Taken together, our data indicated that prenatal neosporosis may be an important cause of infectious bovine abortion in Switzerland.","1449":"Avulsion of the tendon of the extensor digitalis longus muscle is a rare condition in young, large breed dogs or as a consequence of chronic lateral patellar luxation in adult dogs. Current technique of fixation consists into reattaching the fragment with a lag screw at its origin in the extensor fossa of the lateral femur condyle. If the fragment was considered too friable and reactive to be reattached, it was amputated and the tendon was sutured to the joint capsula. In this present case a adaptation screw with a washer was inserted distally to the sulcus extensorius through the tendon. The proximal part of the tendon was sutured to the joint capsula. The postoperative result was excellent, with recovery of full function of the Musculus extensor digitalis longus.","1450":"One case of a bilateral idiopathic slipped capital femoral epiphysis--\"slipped epiphysis\"--in a cat is described. The similarities and the differences between the cases in human and small animal medicine concerning the incidence, the hypotheses of the pathogenesis and the treatment options are discussed.","1451":"","1452":"","1453":"","1454":"Pig mange was investigated serologically with ELISA using Chekit Sarcoptest. The test consists of a homogenized antigen of Sarcoptes scabiei var. vulpes. A total of 356 sows sera samples were collected from 16 mange free breeding units and 19 units with clinical manifestation of mange infestation. The specificity of the test was 99.34% and the mean sensitivity value was 62%. This test will allow in the future not only the rapid and certain diagnosis of pig mange but also the screening of the pig breeding units after eradication of the disease.","1455":"The purpose of this study was to compare the results of horse blood examinations on a portable blood analysis system, i-STAT SDI, with conventional laboratory equipment and to verify the accuracy and precision. The precision within run was high and the coefficients of variation ranged from 0 to 3.85%. The comparative analysis of patient samples with routine methods showed a very strong positive correlation with correlation coefficients above 0.96 for blood gases, pH, glucose, urea, hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium and potassium, with the exception of chloride where it was 0.867. The i-STAT system provides a quick and accurate stable-side evaluation of laboratory data in critically ill horses and emergency situations.","1456":"The alterations of the haemostatic system (platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], thromboplastin time [standard test, modified test], thrombin time, fibrinogen concentration, activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, X, VIII:C, IX, XI, XII, of prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, antithrombin III, protein C, plasminogen and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, concentration of soluble fibrin and fibrin(ogen) degradation products [FDP], resonance thrombogram) were described in seven dogs with haemorrhagic diathesis in consequence of an infiltrative, growing mammary carcinoma with multifocal invasion of lymphatic and blood vessels. In most of the cases metastases in different organs could be demonstrated. In every case a serious stage of disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis was existent. This was indicated by the distinctly increased concentration (p &lt; 0.0001) of soluble fibrin (27.7 [16.0-79.2] micrograms\/ml, median [minimum-maximum], reference range [RR.]: &lt; 9.4 micrograms\/ml) and FDP (340 [50-860] micrograms\/ml, RR.: &lt; 18 micrograms\/ml) as well as a diminished plasma level of nearly all components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic system concerning especially the concentration of fibrinogen (0.16 [0.01-0.46] g\/l, RR.: 1.17-3.09 g\/l), the activity of factors V (30 [21-40]%, RR.: 75-158%) and VIII:C (9 [4-16]%, RR.: 72-136%) as well as the activity of protein C (8 [3-13]%, RR.: 68-139%) (each: p &lt; 0.0001).","1457":"The effect of doramectin pour-on (Dectomax 0.5% pour-on, Pfizer) against gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and lungworms was investigated in calves grazed on alpine pastures in Switzerland. Doramectin pour-on (0.5 mg\/kg body weight) was administered topically to calves (n = 57, Group D) before and after the alpine grazing season (mid-June to end of September) when the calves were kept on altitudes between 1800 and 2600 m together with 20 untreated calves (Group K). Calves of both groups were grazed together during the alpine season and were subsequently moved to prealpine and home pastures where they were kept until stabling (end of November). Faecal examinations, performed 4 to 5 weeks after anthelmintic treatment of Group D calves showed a marked reduction of the trichostrongyle egg output, which was also low in the untreated calves. Low numbers of Dictyocaulus-larvae were excreted by the calves at turnout to the alpine pastures. At the end of September the mean excretion of Dictyocaulus-larvae had increased markedly in both groups. After treatment of Group D calves the larval output remained negative until stabling. In contrast, the larval excretion of the untreated calves (Group K) reached highest levels at the end of October and 4 calves exhibited clinical signs of dictyocaulosis. The results indicate that the strategic use of doramectin pour-on in June and in late September provided good protection against severe infections with D. viviparus. The infection level with GIN confirmed that these parasites are of minor relevance under the extensive grazing conditions on high alpine pastures.","1458":"A dynamic fixation technique, that is technically easy and requires a minimal instrumentarium, is described for the treatment of subluxations, luxations and fractures of the thoracic and lumbar vertebral column in dogs and cats. Results of its application in 34 dogs and three cats are reported.","1459":"The collagen metabolites hydroxyproline (HYP), deoxypyridinoline (DPD) and pyridinoline (PYD) are suitable markers for bone resorption in humans and several animal species. In a field trial cows with symptoms of periparturient paresis (group A) and healthy control cows without symptoms (group B) were compared and urine and blood samples were collected on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 14 after parturition. In group A the mean +\/- SE serum Ca concentration on day 1 was 1.4 +\/- 0.1 mmol\/l whereas those of group B were 2.0 +\/- 0.1 mmol\/l. A significant increase of the corrected urinary HYP concentration was observed from parturition to day 14 (from 2.8 to 8.8 mumol\/mmol creatinine) and the concentrations at the different times were higher in group A than in group B. The mean corrected total and free DPD and total PYD concentration in urine increased after parturition to reach a peak at day 9. For DPD and PYD the mean concentrations between the two groups did not differ significantly. The DPD and PYD are useful tools to follow bone resorption in dairy cows, although in our study no difference between the two groups could be found which means that both groups were able to mobilize Ca from bone.","1460":"The problem of inherited deafness in various breeds of dogs and cats catches more and more attention in concerned breeders and owners. This article presents an update in the current knowledge of prevalence, aetiology and genetics of sensorineural deafness and its differentiation against acquired forms of hearing disorders. An electrophysiological method (Auditory Evoked Potentials) to obtain an objective diagnosis of hearing disorders is presented. The usefulness of Auditory Evoked Potentials as an instrument for genetic investigations in inherited deafness is discussed.","1461":"A 11 year old female spayed Jack Russel Terrier was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. After successful initial treatment metabolic control deteriorated although insulin dosage was increased. Cushing's syndrome was diagnosed and treatment with Lysodren was started. As a result blood glucose concentrations decreased. The difficulty to diagnose Cushing's syndrome in some diabetic dogs is discussed.","1462":"A standard diagnostic procedure for patellar luxation is described. It is based upon the patellar luxations grade 1 to 4, which have been published before, and contains additional definitions in terms of the animals positioning toward the examiner.","1463":"RT-PCR followed by direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified cDNA was carried out to analyse most of the 5' nontranslated region (5'NTR) of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) isolates from the five 1993 disease outbreaks in Switzerland. Sequence data were compared to other CSFV strains, and dendrograms were constructed in order to determine the phylogenetic relationship of the Swiss virus strains. Dendrograms formed by the analysis of different parts of the 5'NTR were compared. It was shown that all Swiss isolates were related to other CSFV strains involved in disease outbreaks in Europe in the 1990s. Two of the isolates were indistinguishable from a CSFV strain isolated from wild boar meat imported from China into Austria in 1993. The risk of introducing classical swine fever by improperly treated swill and, in particular by importing wild boar meat is discussed.","1464":"Issues of breed defects such as morphology, physiology or behaviour in pure-breed dogs, are briefly discussed. Suggestions for various kinds of improvements are made, particularly concerning legislation, analysis of pedigree to avoid undesirable breed characteristics and what breeding clubs, individual breeders, judges, future dog owners and veterinarians could and should do about these problems; these are followed by summary conclusions.","1465":"Atrial fibrillation and dilated cardiomyopathy were diagnosed in a 9-year old boxer who was examined because of anorexia and ascites. Longterm treatment included a diuretic (furosemide), an ACE-inhibitor (benazepril), digoxin, and a betablocker (atenolol). The prognosis for DCMP is unfavorable--the described dog died 11 months after diagnosis.","1466":"Two young dogs were presented with an accumulation of mucus in the frontal sinus which occurred after a head injury had caused an obstruction of the nasofrontal openings. Both dogs were successfully managed by surgically reconstructing and draining the nasofrontal ducts.","1467":"In a colony of sledge dogs, an increased incidence of ulcerative glossitis was diagnosed. Several facts indicate that the lesions were directly caused by UV light. The presence of signs coincided with the use of the dogs of the glacier. The lesions were localized on the first part of the tongue. The histologic changes were consistent with a phototoxic reaction and other causes of glossitis were ruled out.","1468":"A 4 month old female German Shepherd was presented for the work-up of a heart murmur that has been detected by the referring veterinarian. Clinical examination and thoracic radiography showed an enlargement of the right ventricle, and an increased pulmonary perfusion. Echocardiography showed an interatrial communication (atrial septum defect), and colour Doppler allowed the confirmation of a left to right shunt. The article discusses the diagnostic possibilities of this rare congenital cardiac malformation in the dog.","1469":"","1470":"","1471":"Canine hepatozoonosis is presented with 3 cases. The most common signs are: fever, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea and vomiting, muscle weakness, lymphadenopathy, anemia and purulent discharge from the nose and the eyes. Because an infection with H. canis in the dog is often associated with other infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis, ehrlichiosis and babesiosis, the clinical picture may be dominated by these diseases. The diagnosis is made with the typical inclusions in neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes. Only short remissions may be obtained with the presently available medications.","1472":"Results of surgery of high teat stenosis remained disappointing until nowadays. The aim of this pilot study was to elaborate a new theloscopic surgical resection. A 5.5 year old swiss milk cow was suspected to have posttraumatic high teat stenosis. Diagnosed was ascertained by teat sonography. Animal was sedated and local anesthesia was performed at the base of the teat. After a teat side incision, resectoscope was introduced. Stenosis was electro-divided under continuity saline-solution irrigation and coagulation of bleeding vessels. After a follow-up period of 4 months, the cow was milked without residual. No intercurrent infections occurred. There were no signs of recurrence in the control teat sonography. Theloscopic electroresection of teat stenosis is a possible new, surgical, minimal invasive, option, to treat high teat stenosis.","1473":"This report describes the case history of a 1.5-year-old ram admitted to the Clinic for Food Animals and Horses, University of Berne, Switzerland, because of an acute severe lameness of the left rear limb. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed disruption of the stifle joint with rupture of both cruciate ligaments, the medial collateral ligament, and disruption of both menisci from their attachments. The ruptured ligaments were replaced by synthetic ligament prostheses. Long-term examination at 12 months after implantation revealed slight instability of the stifle joint, caused by degeneration of the medial meniscus, and signs of arthrosis deformans. The new formed periarticular connective tissue contributed to the stability of the stifle joint, so that a good functional result was achieved. Necropsy findings at 14 months after implantation confirmed that the synthetic ligament prostheses were intact and the medial meniscus was detached from its insertion and incorporated into the joint capsule. At microscopic examination of the synthetic band prosthesis, ingrowth of collagen and fibrous tissue was evident.","1474":"Microfilarial infections could be detected by the Difil Test in 11 (2.2%) of 479 blood samples of clinically asymptomatic dogs from the South of Switzerland. Dirofilaria repens and D. immitis were identified in 3 (0.6%) and 8 dogs (1.6%), respectively, by the acid phosphatase activity of the microfilariae. 10 dogs with microfilaremia had been abroad or a stay outside Switzerland could not be excluded. One dog diagnosed with D. immitis could have had acquired the infection in the canton Tessin according to information given by the owner. Dogs with microfilaremia are a potential source of infection for mosquitoes. An indigenous cycle of infection in the South of Switzerland is possible since the mean average temperature in summer is above 18 degrees C which is necessary for optimal parasite development in the vector. A strict control of imported dogs or animals exposed to the disease in endemic regions as well as the therapy of infected dogs in the South of Switzerland is advisable.","1475":"In order to detect lesions of a spongiform encephalopathy and\/or accumulation of the protease resistant prion protein (PrPres), 182 offspring of cows affected with BSE were examined neuropathological and immunohistochemically. Neither spongiform encephalopathy nor PrPres accumulation were found. In seven animals other neuropathological lesions were seen, significant ones in three. Because of the small risk of exposure to contaminated feed in these animals, nearly all of which were born after the introduction of the protein feed ban for ruminants, the occurrence of spongiform encephalopathy in this series of BSE offspring would be suggestive of maternal transmission. However, the value of the study in this respect is quite limited. Only half of the animals were old enough to develop clinical and pathological evidence of the disease. If a maternal effect on the risk for the offspring is only to be expected during the last 6 months of the incubation of the dam as suggested by British investigations, only few animals in this study would fulfil the requirement of having been born during this critical period. Since it cannot be entirely excluded that the BSE agent transiently invades extraneural tissues in the early stages of infection, the above mentioned restriction to the final 6 months of the incubation time of the dam would not necessarily be applicable to all situations. We concluded that this study supports previous observations according to which maternal transmission of BSE is at best a rare event.","1476":"This study involved 182 calves, heifers and cows that were the first generation progeny of cows with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). All animals underwent clinical and neurological examinations. Blood, milk, urine, ruminal fluid and cerebrospinal fluid samples were examined. Each cow underwent a specific examination for BSE which included assessment of behaviour, sensitivity and locomotion. This examination was performed twice, and there was very good agreement between the results. The most common symptom was nervousness (14 animals). In the first examination, 68 animals were mildly to moderately sensitive to touching of the head, 44 animals were hypersensitive to a halogen light and 35 animals were hypersensitive to a camera flash. Twenty-four animals reacted by kicking when the hindlimbs were touched with a broom. None of the animals had disturbances in locomotion. Based on the interpretation of all findings and the comparison of the results of the first and second examinations, 173 animals were diagnosed as free of BSE. In 9 animals, the disease could not be ruled out; however, it could not be confirmed in any of them. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations of the brain of all animals were negative for BSE (see Part 2 of the study for details). The results of this study indicate that abnormal clinical findings may occur in clinically healthy cattle. However, none of the progeny of cows with BSE exhibited clinical signs typical of BSE, such as disturbances in behaviour; sensitivity and locomotion.","1477":"Elbow joints of a random sample of 59 cats were investigated by means of X-rays and dissection as well as histologically and by making cuts through synthetic resin-embedded joints. Bone-dense shadow craniolateral to the elbow joint was observed in X-ray images of 23 limbs (about 20%). Furthermore 8 of these 23 elbow joints (about 7%) showed signs of arthrotic alteration. Histologic examination revealed one or more centers of metaplasia of varying status of development of the annular ligament of the radius. Alterations varied from chondroid metaplasia to mineralisation and ossification. They turned out to be located in the area where the annular ligament of the radius crosses the tendon of origin of the supinator muscle and are considered to be a reaction of tough connective tissue to mechanical stress. Compressive forces seem to be less responsible than tensile stress. As soon as bone-dense shadow is observed in X-ray images, alterations have grown so far as the annular ligament of the radius as well as the tendon of origin of the supinator muscle are affected.","1478":"","1479":"","1480":"What are transgenic mice and what do we learn from them? In this review, we focus on the generation of \"classical\" transgenic and \"knock-out\" mice. The establishment of transgenic and gene-targeted mice provides an unique tool to study the function(s) of a given gene in the context of a whole organism. Based on selected examples, we demonstrate the potential of this transgenic technology to understand the interactions between cells, organs and organ systems in genetically engineered mice.","1481":"The case records of 46 dogs with hypercalcemia were studied retrospectively. The most common cause of hypercalcemia was malignancy, of which the majority were diagnosed as having lymphosarcoma (LSA, n = 23). Interestingly only 15 had palpable lymphadenopathy. Other neoplasia were apocrine adenocarcinoma of the anal sac (n = 4), mammary adenocarcinoma (n = 2), anaplastic carcinoma (n = 1), and malignant histiocytosis (n = 1). Non-neoplastic reasons for hypercalcemia were hypoadrenocorticism (n = 5), acute renal failure (n = 2), chronic renal failure (n = 2), hypervitaminosis D (n = 1), and primary hyperparathyroidism (n = 1). In 4 cases no definitive diagnosis could be obtained. Moderate to marked hyperphosphatemia and azotemia was found in all dogs with primary renal failure and in 4 of 5 dogs with hypoadrenocorticism. In contrast only 4 of 31 dogs with neoplasia showed (mild) hyperphosphatemia and 20 showed mild to moderate azotemia. Elevated PTH levels were found in dogs with primary chronic renal failure and with primary hyperparathyroidism, but also in one dog with neoplasia. Low PTH concentrations were measured in the dog with hypervitaminosis D and in 8 cases with neoplasia. Additional three cases with neoplasia had values in the reference range. 1. The most common cause of hypercalcemia is LSA. Absence of palpable lymphadenopathy does not exclude LSA and further diagnostic steps may be necessary 2. The combination of moderate to marked hyperphosphatemia suggests primary renal failure or hypoadrenocorticism. 3. An elevated PTH level is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, but does not exclude other causes of hypercalcemia. ","1482":"The epidemiology of nematodes in livestock in The Gambia was assessed. A prophylactic biannual treatment was then tested on cattle and sheep. This treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the reproductive performances (sheep: lambings\/year increasing from 1.04 to 1.22 and lambs\/lambing increasing from 1.11 to 1.19; cattle: age at first calving decreasing from 58 to 50 months) and, in cattle, a significant improvement of the weight (varying between 8% and 17% in 1 to 4 year old animals). A socioeconomic study conducted in parallel showed that the treatment in cattle is on average profitable (benefit\/cost ratio of 1.14) but remains a risky investment which should not be generalised (benefit\/cost ratio would have been below 1 in more than half of the participating herds). In sheep, the benefit\/cost ratio is high (2.47) with a low risk of losses (&lt; 10%). The obstacles to the adoption by farmers of such a treatment and the usefulness of a pluridisciplinary approach in similar studies are then discussed.","1483":"","1484":"","1485":"The variability of the symptomatology and of the lesions of renal amyloidosis of the shar pei is described together with difficulty of making the diagnosis.","1486":"Between 1990 and 1996, 21 cows suffering from cancer eye had been admitted to the Clinic for Food Animals and Horses, University of Bern. Case history and localization and dimension of the tumor at admission were evaluated. Treatment consisted of bulbus extirpation in 17 of 21 cows. In two cows, cryosurgery was performed, while two cows were slaughtered for economic reasons. Telephone follow-up inquiries were performed between 10 and 84 months after surgery. Mean survival time after surgery was 15 months. Recurrence of the tumor was evident in six cases within 2 to 14 months after surgery. We recommend bulbus extirpation in cows with cancer eye to extend productive life.","1487":"Veterinarians are often faced with the question of whether they should treat or--in accordance with the animal owner--to end the life of a pet animal. This situation can be described as a moral dilemma. Can this moral dilemma be solved? The author argues that we have special moral obligations to care for pet animals. The special, quasi-personal relationships between pet animal and animal owners provide veterinarians in most cases with moral reasons to carry out the treatment.","1488":"","1489":"In order to evaluate a dipstick test for the semi-quantitative determination of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in milk, we determined the BHB content in milk samples of healthy and ketotic high yielding dairy cows with the dipsticks. BHB was analysed on an analyser in 39 of these milk samples as well as in 88 blood samples which were drawn when milk samples were obtained. There was a strong correlation between milk BHB values which were determined with the two methods (r = 0.92; BHB quantitative = -9.9 + 1.25 x BHB dipstick value). Although BHB concentration in plasma is much higher than in milk, the correlation between plasma BHB, determined on an analyser, and the dipstick test results in the corresponding milk samples was also quite strong (r = 0.84; plasma BHB in mmol\/l = 0.23 + 0.009 x milk BHB in mumol\/l, determined with dipsticks). The dipstick test is suitable for the diagnosis of clinical ketosis and for monitoring the energy status of high yielding dairy cows.","1490":"","1491":"","1492":"Oral malignant neoplasms are very common in old dogs. The prognosis of oral malignant melanoma (MM) for long-term survival is poor, because of early metastasis and delayed diagnosis. Oral MM in immature dogs is rare. A case of oral MM in an immature dog is described. The diagnostic workup includes radiographs of the tumor and thorax, a cytologic examination of the regional lymph nodes and a biopsy of the tumor. The therapy with the best chance of success is the radical surgical excision of the tumor.","1493":"Polycythemia--characterized by an excessive number of erythrocytes--is a rare disease in the dog with a chronic progressive course and unspecific symptoms. There are several forms: a primary, a secondary adequate or a secondary inadequate polycythemia. The clinical workup is done step by step and after stabilization of critical patients, the remaining therapy must address the primary cause. We report on a five year old male Leonberger dog suffering from secondary, inadequate polycythemia. He was presented with apathy, gait disturbances and disorientation. On the basis of the diagnostic workup a pathological process in the kidneys was postulated. Initially focal seizures became generalized later, most probably because of formation of a forebrain thrombus with secondary hypoxia. Even after emergency treatment the general state deteriorated. The course indicated possible sepsis. Because of the critical picture with secondary complications and the poor prognosis, the dog was euthanised. The histopathological results showed T-cell renal lymphoma and secondary injury to the forebrain.","1494":"The aim of the study was to examine the incidence of lumbar paralysis in goats and the possible role of Elaphostrongylus cervi as an agent. For this reason questionnaires concerning the clinical pictures and the incidence of lumbar paralysis were sent to 200 owners of goats and to 9 veterinarians. The study showed that the symptoms of lumbar paralysis had been observed for many years mainly during the winter. Most of the animals suffering from lumbar paralysis originated from the Valley of Leventina and Blenio. The symptoms of lumbar paralysis could be observed from 29 owners of goats. Fecal examination of 36 red deer in the autumn of 1995 was carried out for studying if deer plays a role in spreading the larvae of E. cervi. Twenty-five red deer passed the E. cervi larvae. This could be indicating that deer plays an possible role in the infection of goats with E. cervi.","1495":"60 birds and environmental samples from 41 suspect flocks (S. enteritidis in faeces or litter, positive serology, close connection with human cases) were investigated to define material and minimal number of birds for detection of infection. S. enteritidis was found in 26\/41 (63%) flocks with marked differences in prevalence. S. enteritidis was isolated from ovary (96% of positive flocks), oviduct and liver (87%), spleen (83%), caecal contents (50%) and faeces from the litter floor (57%), but never from egg shells and membranes. As a consequence of this study the bacteriological examination of birds is highly recommended.","1496":"This short review highlights the characteristics of infectious laryngotracheitis, the diagnostic methods and the actual disease situation in Switzerland and other European countries. Recommendations for a future control policy are outlined.","1497":"30 broiler flocks from two majors Swiss broiler producing companies were examined for lesions relevant to meat inspection between November 1995 and April 1996. 71.8% of condemned carcasses and viscera were assigned to ascites syndrome, bacterial infections and runting. Other diseases and lesions due to injury or processing were rare. Escherichia coli was responsible for the majority of infections. The average condemnation rate (1.0%) corresponded to findings in literature.","1498":"","1499":"","1500":"","1501":"","1502":"","1503":"The goal of this study was to determine whether Helicobacter pylori or similar bacteria are present in the abomasum of cows. The abomasa of 112 clinically healthy cows were examined at slaughter. Prior to macroscopic examination, samples for bacteriological and histological examination were obtained from the fundus and from the pylorus. Bacteriological examination of the abomasal mucosa included the urease test, the microscopic examination of a Gram's stained smear, and culture on various solid media. Samples from the pylorus (63) were more often positive in the urease test than those from the fundus (35). Examination of Gram's stained smears revealed two groups of suspicious microorganisms; spiral-shaped and rod-shaped bacteria, whereby the latter could not be differentiated morphologically from Helicobacter pylori. Spiral-shaped bacteria were more often isolated from the pylorus (101 samples) than from the fundus (30 samples). The bacteria that resembled Helicobacter pylori were found in seven samples from the pylorus and in seven samples from the fundus. Helicobacter pylori was not cultured in any of the abomasal samples. Tissue samples from the fundus and pylorus were stained with hemalum and eosin and with silver according to Warthin-Starry. All but one abomasum had diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Lymphocytic follicles were observed in 109 abomasa. Neutrophils were seen in four abomasa, eosinophils in 37 and parasitic lesions in 20. As in the Gram's stained smears, spiral-shaped and rod-shaped bacteria were seen in silver-stained smears. Spiral-shaped bacteria were found in the pylorus of 96 abomasa and in the fundus and pylorus of one abomasum. The rod-shaped bacteria could not be differentiated from Helicobacter pylori by light microscopy. They were seen in glandular lumina of the superficial region of the mucosa in 97 abomasa. They were limited to the pylorus and fundus in 16 and 59 cases, respectively, and occurred in both these areas in 23 cases. The results of this study indicate that spiral-shaped bacteria may be found frequently in the bovine abomasum. Further investigations are required to determine whether these bacteria are associated with the inflammatory lesions that were observed and whether they play a role in the pathogenesis of abomasal ulcers.","1504":"Between December 1996 and March 1997, 95 E.coli strains were isolated from mastitis milk samples from 95 different animals. In 29.5% resistance could be observed against one or several of the examined antibiotics. However, Cefoperazone, Polymyxin B, Colistin and Gentamycin proved effective against the majority of these strains. Between 0 and 23% of E.coli were resistant against the single tested antibiotics. As opposed to earlier investigations a smaller number of Chloramphenicol-resistant strains could be found. One strain with multiple resistance was also resistant against Gentamycin. However, in the treatment of mastitis the resistance of a particular agent is only one among several contributing factors.","1505":"The case of a 2 1\/2 year old Swiss Braunvieh heifer suffering from an acute disseminated mycotic encephalitis caused by a Mucorales spp. infection is presented. Clinical signs and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (increased protein concentration and pleocytosis) were typical for an acute encephalitis, probably due to a listeriosis. The histological examination of the brain revealed an acute disseminated thrombo-embolic encephalomyelitis due to a fungi infection, morphologically consistent with Mucorales spp. The occurrence of bovine cerebral mucormycosis is rare and therefore the veterinarian should become aware of a case which was clinically not distinguishable from a listeriosis.","1506":"37 Salmonella gallinarum-pullorum-strains were isolated from dead poultry between 1986 and 1996. All strains except one belonged to the biovar pullorum. 33 isolates were from fancy poultry flocks, four from backyard flocks. 10 of 12 chicks and 10 of 25 adult birds showed clinical signs of disease. The growing significance of fancy and backyard flocks as a reservoir for S. gallinarum-pullorum is emphasized in view of the increase in free range management of commercial layer and broiler flocks.","1507":"Oedema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea in swine are associated with the colonization of the intestine with toxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli bacteria of various serotypes. Colonization depends on specific binding between adhesive fimbriae and receptors on the enterocytes. The demonstration of these receptors allows the identification of susceptible and resistant pigs. Direct sequencing of the alpha (1,2) fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1) in swine being either susceptible or resistant to adhesion by F18 fimbriated E.coli revealed a mutation at basepair 307 (M307). Analysis of the mutation in Swiss Landrace and Large White families showed close linkage with the locus controlling resistance and susceptibility to E.coli F18 adhesion (ECF18R). The FUT1 (M307) mutation is a good marker for selection of E.coli of F18 adhesion resistant animals. The mutation is found with variable frequencies in Duroc, Hampshire and Pietrain pigs as well.","1508":"","1509":"A new computerised ultrasound-based spirometry system according to Buess et al. (1995) modified by a double flow measurement facility was used to study pulmonary function in healthy horses and horses affected with subclinical and manifest chronic bronchiolitis (CB). The horses were first evaluated at rest without any medication. On another occasion all horses were tested following i.v. administration of xylazine (0.4 mg\/kg) and following i.v. administration of lobeline hydrochloride (l.hy.; 0.2 mg\/kg) to evaluate the effect of xylazine and l.hy. on different spirometric variables. Ultrasound-based spirometry proved to be an easily applicable method for lung function testing, even in difficult horses. However, there existed a pronounced physiological variation for all measured lung function parameters and no significant differences between healthy horses and horses with chronic bronchiolitis could be found except for the expiratory tidal volume (VTE p &lt; 0.05). Individually, a marked decrease of variability from breath to breath following either xylazine and l.hy. administration could be observed for all parameters, except the flow-time-ratio (Tpef.\/ Texp.) and the flow-volume-ratio (Vpef.\/Vexp).","1510":"Large scale preventive treatments against bovine hypodermosis have been performed in the Canton of Grisons and in different Jura areas. Either Metrifonate (Neguvon 10% spot-on, Bayer AG) or Ivermectin \"microdoses\" (i.e. 0.1 ml Ivomec ad. inj-MSD AGVET-per animal) have been applied. The treatment of dairy cows with Neguvon at the then recommended dose (24 ml\/animal) showed a low efficacy of 80%, without any correlation to the date of treatment. An increase of the dose to 36 ml\/animal revealed an efficacy of 93%, while a weight-dependent dose of 6 ml\/100 kg body weight reduced the warble infestation by 97.3% without any drug-related side-effects. The few observed side-effects-salivation and mild meteorism--are likely to be due to the destruction of Hypoderma lineatum larvae in the gullet of treated cows. No case of abortion was reported. The Ivomec--\"microdose\" applied to young animals or dry cows showed an efficacy &gt; 99.8%. The available drugs would thus allow a quick and efficacious control of bovine hypodermosis, provided they would be used systematically and at an appropriate dose in endemic areas.","1511":null,"1512":"In this article an attempt was made to analyze the professional situation of women in Switzerland. Although over 70% female students are registered in both Colleges of Veterinary Medicine in Switzerland, there are still very few women working full time in their later career. Furthermore, only very few female veterinarians are represented in higher positions, either in academia, industry or as head of private hospitals. Even though the professional environment would welcome those female students, it seems that other than professional reasons may be involved in this discrepancy. Family traditions, unrecognized patriarchal structures in education, but also in philosophical and psychological traditions may be responsible for the deep conflict between the external modern environment and the inner values of women, creating an unsurmountable obstacle for women to combine a successful professional and private life.

Clinical abnormalities included weakness and episodic vomiting. Chronic occult blood loss in adult dogs most commonly occurs in the gastrointestinal tract associated with ulcus or neoplasia. Possible diagnostic steps include radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory laparotomy. In the dog of this report gastric and duodenal adenocarcinomata were found during necropsy confirming the clinical suspicion of a bleeding gastrointestinal malignancy.","1515":"Tumor growth-rate affects prognosis and treatment planning. The injection of bromodeoxyuridine in dogs and cats permits determination of the potential doubling time following a biopsy of neoplastic tissue and flow cytometric analysis.

This report describes a method to measure potential tumor doubling time of different tumors, and presents results of canine and feline tumors.","1516":"This study investigated the current situation of cat husbandry in the animal shelters of german-speaking Switzerland. In 1993, Swiss-german animal shelters occupied just over 5000 housing spaces. Additionally, there was one quarantine space per eight housing spaces. During the summer, which is the season of highest demand, the requirement for housing and quarantine spaces was inadequate. In 1993, approximately 30,000 cats were housed in Swiss-german animal shelters. About four fifths of all entries were boarding cats and the rest were homeless cats. In 1993, about three-quarters of all homeless cats were rehoused with new owners. About a tenth of the remaining cats were reclaimed by their owners. Another tenth of the animals were euthanatized. 63 animal shelters kept cats mainly in group housing enclosures. 15 preferred single\/pair boxes, whereas 22 animal shelters used both types of housing. This study shows that more housing and quarantine spaces are needed and should be built for the summer season, to avoid the inadequate housing capacities in Swiss-german animal shelters.","1517":null,"1518":"Due the examination of six Brown Swiss cows the \"Schinberg-fever\" a clinical picture known for years in central Switzerland could be identified as bovine ehrlichiosis. Clinical signs were observed 23 to 116 days after the animals were turned out on pasture. Main symptoms were fever and reduced milk yield. All animals were infested with ticks and showed a severe leucopenia. In buffy coat preparations Ehrlichia phagocytophila could be identified in neutrophils and eosinophils, rarely in monocytes. All six cows could be successfully treated with oxytetracycline.","1519":"20 sarcoid-affected horses from a practice in the northern Jura were used in this experiment. The mean age of the 20 horses was 3.9 years at the time of the first observation of sarcoid tumors. On the average, 4.4 tumours were noted per horse. 10 of the horses were treated in a double-blind study with an unspecific immunostimulant (Baypamun P), 10 others received a placebo. One single tumour only was treated per horse. The injections were given under and around the sarcoid. In eight out of the 20 horses all tumours regressed totally or for more than 50% of their initial size. Five of these had received placebo, three the immunostimulant. Four animals showed a modest, but measurable reduction in tumour size (3 immuno-stimulant, 1 placebo) and in the remaining eight horses (4:4) no reduction or even an increase in tumour size was observed. The phenomenon of tumour regression was very probably due to spontaneous regression and horses which had been observed to develop sarcoid within the last three months had significantly more regressions than animals with older tumours (p &lt; 0.05). The haplotype of the equine leucocyte antigens was thought to predispose 12 of the 20 horses for the sarcoid. However, the ELA-type did not measurably influence the phenomenon of tumour regression.","1520":"Clinical findings in seven goats affected with cerebrospinal nematodiasis are described. The animals originated from different parts of Switzerland. The disease occurred mainly in winter. The animals were admitted to the clinic because of progressive pelvic limb ataxia, recumbency, vestibular disease and circling. Clinical findings were complete or incomplete posterior paresis, pelvic limb ataxia, circling, reduced cutaneous sensation and proprioceptive deficits as well as cranial nerve reflexes deficits. The general condition was slightly reduced and the appetite was normal. In three goats predominance of mononuclear and eosinophilic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid was interpreted as typical findings for parasite infestation in the central nervous system. Histopathological changes and the finding of a nematode in cross sections in two affected animals confirmed the diagnosis. Infection with Elaphostrongylus cervi is discussed due to close contact with deer.","1521":"Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (BLAD) Syndrome is a lethal congenital immunodeficiency caused by the strong reduction in the expression of leukocyte integrins (beta 2 integrins) on the surface of leukocytes. Therefore, neutrophils from BLAD animals lack the capacity to adhere to the endothelium, a necessary step in their emigration into foci of infection. Due to the virtual absence of neutrophil-mediated host defense, animals suffer from recurrent infection of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and finally succumb to infections. A 14 days old Holstein-Friesian calf showing omphalophlebitis and leukocytosis, was referred to our clinic. It was found to suffer from several febrile episodes of infection. The tentative diagnosis BLAD could be confirmed for the first time in Switzerland by flow cytometry, pedigree analysis and by restriction fragment length polymorphism.","1522":"Acquired urinary incontinence occurs in 20% of spayed dogs and there exists a strong correlation between body weight and the risk of urinary incontinence. Bitches with a body weight of more than 20 kg have a risk of 30% white smaller dogs have a risk of 10%. A particular breed disposition exists in Boxers in which 65% are affected. Other breeds with a more than average disposition for urinary incontinence are Dobermans and Giant Schnauzers. Urinary incontinence due to spaying manifests itself mainly while the dogs are sleeping. The cause is a urethral sphincter incompetence which can be verified by a urethral pressure profile (UPP). The microtransducer method proved to be a suitable method for urodynamic studies. It could be demonstrated that the urethral closure pressure is significantly lower in incontinent bitches (4.6 +\/- 2.3 cm H2O) than in continent bitches (18.6 +\/- 10.5 cm H2O). In addition, the urethral closure pressure for continent bitches dropped significantly within 12 months after surgery. Histological examination revealed that the functional urethral closure cannot be explained by the extent of discernible structures of the urethral wall as seen by light microscopy.","1523":"","1524":"Twenty cases with patellar luxation in dogs and cats, in which a sulcoplasty and cranialisation of the tuberositas tibiae were performed, were investigated and reviewed retrospectively. Twelve knees were available for follow-up after a mean period of 15 months. Clinical scoring of patients showed eight with no lameness, three with an occasional weightbearing lameness, and one with a frequent weightbearing lameness. The patella was stable and could not be luxated in ten out of twelve cases. Degenerative joint disease was slightly progressive in the postoperative period. It did not impair the outcome of the procedure.","1525":"","1526":"In April 1996 an attack of black flies (Diptera, Simuliidae) to horses was observed in the region of Basle, Switzerland.

For S. ornatum this is the first record in Switzerland that this species takes blood meals on horses.","1527":"After an introduction on pathophysiological and etiological aspects of idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, ten dogs affected with this condition are described. Clinical signs permitted to establish a diagnosis of suspicion in all cases. Electrocardiography, thoracic radiography and echocardiography allowed confirmation of the diagnosis. Echocardiography was the most sensitive method available. Six dogs had idiopathic pericardial effusion. A subtotal pericardectomy was performed in two of these dogs. In four dogs, the effusion was caused by a tumor. Two dogs with mesothelioma were euthanized because of poor prognosis. Heart base tumors were found in the two other dogs. One of them is still alive and well one year after subtotal pericardectomy. The other one was euthanized due to deterioration of his condition two years after the operation. Idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion carries a good prognosis if appropriately treated (pericardiocentesis, possibly subtotal pericardectomy). Pericardial effusion is also frequently associated with tumors. In such cases, prognosis and therapy essentially depend on the type of tumor.","1528":"This retrospective study describes the case reports of 17 cattle suffering from precarpal hygroma, admitted to the clinic for food animals and horses, University of Berne, between 1990 and 1994. The following criteria were evaluated: sex, age, and bodyweight, case history, clinical findings at admission, surgical technique, aftercare, and short- and long-term results. The hygroma was congenital in 3 cases and acquired at the age of 2 to 84 months in 14 cases. Characteristic clinical findings at admission were a non painful, fluctuating, well delineated swelling of the precarpal area with a maximal diameter of 6 to 20 cm, which did not provoke any lameness. Treatment consisted of surgical excision of the bursa. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the animal in lateral recumbency and the affected limb positioned uppermost. After placing a tourniquet proximal to the carpal joint, routine preparation and draping of the surgical field, the bursa was resected completely, a penrose drain introduced, and primary wound closure attempted. Aftercare consisted of parenteral antimicrobial treatment and immobilisation of the affected limb with a full-limb splint bandage to prevent wound dehiscence and seroma formation. Primary wound healing was achieved in all cases. At the time of long-term follow-up evaluation, 4 to 48 months after surgery, telephone conversation with the owners revealed uncomplicated healing in 16 cases. In one case, recurrence of the hygroma had occurred a few weeks after surgical excision had been performed.","1529":null,"1530":"A survey of the prevalence of lung lesions in randomly selected slaughtered swine representative of the Swiss fattening pig population was carried out from May to September 1992 in six large abattoirs. In total 8921 lungs out of 561 herds were examined. Histological investigations were completed in every herd. No gross lesions could be found in 56% of the pigs. The most frequent lesions in individuals were bronchopneumonia (21%) and diffuse pleuritis (21%). Linear scars (9%), focal pleural fibrosis without any pneumonic lesion (2%), pleuropneumonia (1%) and abscesses (1%) were less prevalent. The prevalence of lesions at the herd level was completely different. The lungs of only 14% of the herds were free of any lesions. The main finding at the herd level was a diffuse pleuritis (75%), followed by bronchopneumonia (64%), linear scars (60%), focal pleural fibrosis (20%), abscesses (14%) and pleuropneumonia (9%). In 94% of the herd samples with macroscopically diagnosed bronchopneumonia, the histological lesions were consistent with enzootic pneumonia of pigs.","1531":"The clinical presentation of a dog with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which resembled lymphosarcoma (LSA) is described. The differences between acute leukemias and LSA are explained and the most common clinical features of ALL reported in the veterinary literature are listed.","1532":"The results of an investigation on Echinococcus multilocularis-metacestodes in European water voles (Arvicola terrestris) are shown. The investigation materials were 28 water voles captured in Schermann-traps on a meadow in the canton of Fribourg and subsequently maintained in laboratory cages. The animals were patho-anatomically and histo-pathologically examined, a part of them additionally with an E. multilocularis-specific direct immunofluorescence-assay and\/or a polymerase-chain-reaction. Radiographs were obtained from one animal, showing typical calcifications as they often occur with alveolar echinococcosis. Altogether 11 out of 28 (39%) animals proved to be infected with E. multilocularis. As far as we know this represents the highest percentage of infested intermediate hosts ascertained in Europe. However, fertile, i.e. able to infect, protoscolices were detected in only two cases. In spite of this small number of protoscolices it can be shown that A. terrestris is able to maintain the lifecycle of this cestode at least spatially and temporally limited. In conclusion the possible measures for reducing the infection risk of the people in the affected community are shortly discussed.","1533":"Based on biopsy material, the study describes circannual variations of the accumulation of glycogen and organic carbon in the hair follicles. The results have been obtained by histochemical and biochemical methods. The histochemical-densitometric analysis of glycogen contents in the cells of the outer epithelial root sheath of the hair follicles exhibited a clear circannual course, with maxima in May\/June and December, and minima in March and August. The content of organic carbon of the hair follicles was 7.61 micrograms\/mg (max. 21.56 micrograms\/mg) DW on average, with a corresponding annual cycle. The findings are discussed with regard to the energy metabolism of the hair follicle, especially in view of the fact that a biphasic cycle of hair growth becomes obvious in the Turkish Angora goat, a phenomenon that is obscured by other methods.","1534":"Twin pregnancies are a serious problem in stud medicine as they terminate in most cases in abortion, stillbirth or the delivery of dead or weak and deformed foals. In recent years, the introduction of sonography has greatly improved the management of mares with twin conceptuses, in particular monitoring the phenomenon of spontaneous embryo reduction to a single vesicle. This allows supervision of pregnancy with relatively little expenditure and loss of time. We document the spontaneous reduction to single vesicles of unilateral twin pregnancies in a draught- and a warmblood-mare. In both mares diagnosis of twins was made 17 days after covering; they probably resulted from synchronous double-ovulations. After another 5 days, distinct signs of the loss of one conceptus were recognized and, subsequently, only single pregnancies existed. No interventions were necessary.","1535":"","1536":"Poxvirus infection of a domestic cat is reported. The clinical signs consisted of skin lesions only, which healed within two and a half months. Histopathology revealed cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies typical of pox virus infection. Virus particles morphologically related to the genus orthopoxvirus were detectable in the embedded skin tissue and in skin scraping by electron microscopy. No specific lesions were observed in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane inoculated with an extraction from skin scabs of the cat.","1537":"","1538":"A retrospective study (1984-1994) was made of 10 cases of septic arthritis of the distal interphalangeal joint in horses aged 7 months to 17 years. In 6 cases a hind limb was affected, in 4 cases a front limb. The arthritis was caused either by a puncture wound in the sole area (8 cases), by a perforating wound in the coronary region (1) or iatrogenic (1). All horses exhibited a severe lameness at the walk. Radiography showed no typical lesions in fresh cases, whilst later an increasing subluxation of the joint was observed followed by periosteal reactions. Therapy included partial resection of the deep flexor tendon and fenestration of the Lig.impar in cases of nail puncture, single or repeated joint lavages carried out either under general anesthesia or on the standing horse, and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, using mainly penicillin and gentamicin. 5 out of 10 horses were treated successfully.","1539":"Equine recurrent uveitis is an important ocular disease and the most common cause for blindness in horses and mules worldwide. The anatomy, physiology, immunology and inflammatory reactions of the uveal tract are discussed. Possible etiologies and the clinical signs are described. A detailed description of possible therapies is given and the prognosis is discussed.","1540":"Pain treatment by using local anesthetics is of old tradition and its utilization in functional disorders might be the remedy of choice; an existing pathomorphology is at least an indication for a supporting use. Findings of segmental reflexes and knowledge of chronically stressing factors can help for an efficient and cost-sparing treatment. The major part of time has to be spent on examination but there is no need for high-tech instruments when anamnesis is carefully directed and palpation examination and functional probes are carried out conscientiously (including well-founded anatomical knowledge). In therapy there are also used the segmental reflective pathways as well as \"neural techniques\" meaning blocks of vegetative structures (sympathetic trunk, ganglions and plexuses). In question of resistance to therapy is, considering chronic irritating conditions, the so-called \"treatment of the disturbing region\" a causal treatment in a strict sense.","1541":"","1542":"The most important clinical signs of BSE are hypersensitivity to manipulations of the head and neck and disturbances in behaviour and locomotion. Diagnostic procedures include thorough clinical and neurological examination with emphasis on the assessment of behaviour, locomotion and sensitivity. The findings have to be interpreted carefully and depending on the diagnosis, national animal health regulations must be followed.","1543":"","1544":"","1545":"","1546":"","1547":"","1548":"","1549":"Five calves, seven to nine months of age, were put on pasture in the target area of a shooting range in early May. Acute lead poisoning occurred in one of the calves after five days of grazing, the remainder became ill one to three days later. The most important symptoms consisted of neurological disturbances and included maniacal movements, opisthotonos, drooling, rolling of the eyes, convulsions, licking, champing of the jaws, bruxism, bellowing and breaking through fences All but one calf, which was euthanatized, died within several hours of the occurrence of the first symptoms. In one calf, the concentration of lead in samples of whole blood (940 micrograms\/l), liver (38 mg\/kg wet weight) and kidney (30 mg\/kg wet weight) were markedly increased Post mortem examination of this calf revealed acute cardiac, renal and pulmonary haemorrhage, acute tubulonephrosis and acute severe pulmonary emphysema. The concentration of lead in the dry matter of a grass and a soil sample from the target zone of the shooting range were 29550 mg\/kg and 3900 mg\/kg, respectively. Further investigation revealed that this area had been used as a military shooting range for many years, and in the previous year, approximately 20000 bullets with lead contents of either 3.05 g or 8.55 g had been fired. The results of this study indicate that the target area of shooting ranges must not be used for pasture or for food production for animals or humans.","1550":"The present study describes the poisoning due to Robinia pseudoacacia in two horses. One of the horses showed mainly intestinal symptoms such as decreased intestinal motility and obstipation of the pelvic flexure. In the second animal central nervous symptoms were predominant. It showed intermittent phases of somnolence alternating with phases of excitation and head pressing. In addition mydriasis and a lacking menace response could be observed. Sensation to the head and the spinal reflexes were reduced. Symptomatic treatment was initiated in both animals and recovery occurred within 2 days.","1551":"The cases of neurological diseases at the Institute of Animal Neurology, University of Berne, from 1985-1994 were assessed. During this period 532 cattle with neurological symptoms were examined. After 1980 differential diagnostic investigation of rabies negative brains were not pursued anymore and the number of examined cattle brains had declined to 25-30 per year. With the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 1990 in Switzerland the number of cattle brains examined has increased to 75-80 yearly. The most frequently diagnosed neurological diseases found are BSE, followed by listeriosis and viral encephalitides.","1552":"Between July 1993 and July 1994 morbidity and management information related to dairy cows and their calves up to the age of 8 weeks were recorded in 113 randomly selected dairy herds. Also recorded were any costs incurred through disease and prevention. Blood and faeces were analysed with respect to selected pathogens. The health problems most frequently diagnosed in cows were reproductive and udder diseases. Calves suffered most often from diarrhea, omphalitis and pneumonia. The directly disease-related costs per cow-year on average amounted to CHF 139.44 and CHF 4.18 per calf. For prevention, farmers spent on average CHF 10.18 per cow-year. Results from the laboratory analyses indicate that in 68.1% of the farms antibodies against Leptospira hardjo and in 61.9% against Coxiella burnetii were detected. In 8.0% of the farms antibodies against Mycobacterium paratuberculosis were found. Antibodies against BVD virus was present in 99.4% of the farms. Cows from 63.7% farms were infected with gastrointestinal strongylids. Veterinary assistance was required on average 1.96 times per cow-year. In almost all reproductive and puerperal disease cases a veterinarian was consulted while lameness in the majority of cases was treated by the owner. The veterinary profession was hardly ever involved in disease prevention.","1553":"Urinary incontinence due to spaying is caused by a sphincter incompetence of the urethra. In practice the diagnosis is established by ruling out other causes of incontinence such as neurological disease, bacterial cystitis, urinary tract malformation, iatrogenic ureterovaginal fistula and neoplasia of the urinary tract. An accurate diagnosis of urethral sphincter incompetence is made by urethral pressure profilometry. A urethral closure pressure of 7.4 cm H2O allowed the differentiation of bitches with urinary incontinence, due to spaying, from healthy control dogs with a diagnostic accuracy of 91%. For therapy alpha-adrenergic drugs (Ephedrine or Phenylpropanolamine) are recommended, which result in continence in 74% and improvement in 24% of incontinent patients. In the absence of response estrogens may be used. If the medical therapy fails to achieve urinary continence, the endoscopic injection of collagen into the submucosa of the proximal urethra can be performed. This is a simple and minimally invasive procedure. It rarely leads to complications and may be repeated when necessary. The method is successful in 75% of cases.","1554":"This case report describes history, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic findings, therapy, and outcome of a 5-year-old cow, suffering from retropharyngeal abscessation. Clinical findings at admission included elevated body temperature, head and neck held in extended position, excessive salivation, swelling of the retropharyngeal area, and slight inspiratory noise. Radiographic and endoscopic examination confirmed the tentative diagnosis of retropharyngeal abscessation. Treatment consisted of parenteral application of procaine-penicillin for 10 days and local application of linseed rubefacients for 2 weeks. At that time, abscessation had developed. The abscess was subsequently surgically, approached by a modified Whitehouse approach. During this procedure, the abscess drained into the oropharynx, allowing interruption of surgery. Five months later, clinical, radiographic, and endoscopic follow-up examination revealed complete healing of the retropharyngeal abscess.","1555":"The world wide web (www) on the internet is already a rich source of veterinary informations and offers several world wide discussion fora for problems of veterinary practice.

The mares of the first group were bred by a donkey, those of the second group by a stallion of the \"Freiberger\" breed. On average, the gestation length of mares with \"Freiberger\" foals lasted 336.5 days, and that of mares with mule foals 343.1 days. The difference between both groups was significant (p &lt; 0.001). The shortest and longest observed gestation length of mares with \"Freiberger\" foals was 307 and 361 days, and that of mares with mule foals 315 and 369 days, respectively. Additionally, we examined if the stallion, the mare, the age of the mare, the sex of the foal and the time of mating during the breeding season influenced gestation length of mares with mule foals and if the age of the mare, the sex of the foal and the time of breeding influenced gestation length of mares with \"Freiberger\" foals. The time of breeding and the mare had a significant (p &lt; 0.05) influence on gestation length.","1557":"","1558":"Many Bernese Mountain dogs have been found to exhibit an increased hemorrhagic tendency of unknown etiology. Since other bleeding disorders have been excluded by routine tests and Bernese Mountain dogs have been listed to have von Willebrand's disease (vWD), we analyzed the plasma concentration of the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) in 160 Bernese Mountain dogs that were used for breeding in Switzerland in 1992. We also evaluated the suitability of the commercial Asserachrom vWF test kit to quantitate vWF in canine plasma by comparing the plasma vWF determination with validated vWF ELISA test. The vWF plasma concentration in Bernese Mountain dogs ranged from 13% to 162%, with the Asserachrom test kit (normal range 67% to 124%). Similar values were obtained with the research vWF ELISA kit (10% to 166%), and there was a close correlation between the two test methods. In 8 of the 9 Bernese Mountain dogs with initially low vWF concentration (&lt; 60%), the determination was repeated on another sample. Since the values were well within the normal range, a problem with the collection of blood for the first determination is suspected. We conclude that vWD does not appear to be a clinical issue in Bernese Mountain dogs in Switzerland and is, therefore, not likely to be the cause of the observed bleeding tendency. The commercially available Asserachrom vWF test kit seems suitable for the determination of canine vWF plasma concentrations. It is recommended that low vWF values will be confirmed by the determination in second samples.","1559":"Blood samples were collected from 2892 cows and heifers of various ages from 95 dairy farms in the Kanton of St. Gallen and were tested for antibodies against bovine virus diarrhea. The percentages of seropositive, seronegative and inconclusive cases were 83.7%, 13.0% and 3.3%, respectively. In all herds, at least one case was seropositive, and in 29% of the herds, all the animals tested were seropositive. On a herd basis, the seroprevalence ranged from 16.2% to 100% with a mean (+\/- SD) of 85.8 +\/- 17.6%. The seroprevalence in one to two-year-old heifers was not significantly different from that of the entire sample.","1560":"Polycythemia associated with hepatic carcinoma was diagnosed in a 10-year-old cow, an 8-month-old heifer and a 3-year-old sheep. The cow was referred to our clinic because of weight loss, reduced appetite, hematuria, marked reddening of the mucosa of the tear canal, oral cavity and vestibule and an increased hematocrit. Clinical examination also revealed injected scleral vessels. The erythrocyte count, the PCV, hemoglobin concentration and the activities of the hepatic enzymes were increased. Ultrasonographic examination revealed a very large liver with a focal echogenic lesion. Based on all findings, a diagnosis of polycythemia associated with a liver tumor, was made. The cow was slaughtered. Multifocal liver tumors were diagnosed histologically as hepatocellular carcinoma. The heifer and sheep had similar clinical and hematological findings. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed in the heifer and cholangiocellular carcinoma in the sheep. It was concluded that in all three patients, polycythemia was caused by hepatic carcinoma.","1561":"Diphtheria is an acute communicable disease of man caused by C. diphtheriae. Pharyngeal and cutaneous forms are described, where from both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains can be isolated. The occurrence of C. diphtheriae in dairy cattle has already been reported in the past. The pathogens were isolated from ulcerated teats and from the milk of cows with mastitis as well. These animals were considered to play a role in the transmission of the disease to man. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of C. diphtheriae in a 4 years old cow with generalized, partly ulcerative and purulent skin lesions. Bacteriological examination revealed the presence of very numerous corynebacterium-like organisms, which were characterized as C. diphtheriae subsp. belfanti, a nontoxigenic subspecies of C. diphtheriae. The significance of C. diphtheriae in veterinary medicine and the possible role of cattle as a reservoir of these organisms are discussed.","1562":"Polyostotic hyperostosis is a finding that is often seen on x-rays in companion birds. Hyperestrogenism might be a causative for polyostotic hyperostosis. The purpose of this study was to compare endocrinologic and pathologic findings in birds with polyostotic hyperostosis. Thirty-five affected and three control birds were examined. Blood samples were taken for endocrinologic statement (estrone, estradiol, testosterone and estrone sulfate) and the values were compared with the pathologic findings. In the present study the comparison of endocrinologic and pathologic findings did not reveal any significant results supporting the hypothesis that polyostotic hyperostosis was caused by hyperestrogenism.","1563":null,"1564":"There are several felidae amongst the numerous endangered species. Means of aiding survival are the reintroduction to the wild of animals bred under the auspices of man and their relocation from densely populated to thinly populated areas. It is unlikely that the dangers of such reintroduction or relocation projects have been examined sufficiently in respect to the risks of virus infections confronting individuals kept in zoos or similar situations. This report presents three examples to illustrate that accidental virus infections may be expected to occur when relocating and reintroducing wild cats. The first example is the reintroduction of captive snow leopards. Zoo bred snow leopards may be infected with FIV, a virus infection that is highly unlikely to occur in the original himalayan highlands of Tibet and China. A second example is of several cases of FIP that occurred in European wild cats bred in groups in captivity. The third example mentioned is the relocation of lions from East Africa where all the commonly known feline viruses are wide-spread to the Etosha National Park. In the latter, virus infections such as FIV, FCV and FPV do not occur. The indiscriminate relocation and reintroduction of the wild cats mentioned here harbours a potential of undesirable consequences.","1565":"During this century the field of work for zoo veterinarians has dramatically changed. Preventive medicine at herd, group or even species level has gained importance. The therapy of single animals is no longer a priority. On the basis of recent developments progress for the future can be proposed. Effective conservation requires thinking and action by a combination of different specialists. Exchange of information at an international level will be of increasing importance. The continuing specialisation in veterinary and human medicine requires interdisciplinary co-operation. The ethics of research and medical interventions on zoo animals is of concern to the public and it is necessary to publicly advance the arguments for and against. The training of specialized zoo veterinarians should be increased.","1566":"Feline Odontoclastic Resorptive Lesions (FORL, previously known as \"neck lesions\") on cat teeth are compared to caries and differentiated with the use of new methods. Radiological examination reveals typical odontoclastic resorptive processes, which take place at the dental root and at the periodontium. These lesions demonstrate the destruction on the desmodontium and the following ankylosing reaction. The rhodamine B stain which is selective for caries, stains regions which are softened by caries in a dark red way. Fuchsin\/Acetic-Light Green stained histological preparations demonstrate the resorptive lacunae, resorptive lagoons and resorptive canals. Giant cells with multiple nuclei and reparative cementum can also be shown with the same stain. Hardness measurements using a Knoop diamond (KHN Knoop hardness number) give information about the degree of hardness of the different tissues. Electron microscopic investigations are performed to show the dentinal tubules and allowing the differentiation between FORL and caries. Since FORL also has been found in wild cats we deduced that alimentation has no effect on the pathogenesis of the disease.","1567":"This article describes in short sections the use and interpretation of indirect blood pressure measurements, central venous pressure, body temperature, pulse oximetry, end tidal CO2 measurements, pulse and heart rate, urine production and emergency laboratory values. Most of these parameters are directly or indirectly linked to the perfusion of the patient. Optimizing these values are one of the most important goals in emergency and critical care medicine.","1568":"The use of the activated coagulation time (ACT) for testing the intrinsic coagulation is well established among veterinary practitioners in the USA. The advantage of the ACT compared to other coagulation tests is its ease to be performed under practice conditions. The ACT may be measured manually or instrumentally. The reference range of our instrumental measurement is between 90 and 120 seconds (median 105 seconds), of the manual measurement at room temperature between 115 and 145 seconds (median 125 seconds). Advantages of the instrumental method are the smaller amount of blood (0.4 ml versus 2.0 ml) necessary to perform the test, and the smaller potential for errors by unexperienced examiners. The spread is comparable between the two methods. The most important cause of false results is poor venipuncture technique: traumatic venipuncture will trigger the coagulation cascade already during venipuncture causing an artificially shortened ACT.","1569":"The clinical research results on idiopathic epilepsy (IE) in the dog performed at the Institute of Animal Neurology in Berne between the years 88-95 are presented. Special emphasis was placed on the genetic and electroencephalographic aspects obtained from large, uniform dog populations. We showed that IE affects all dogs of different ages. Although the clinical manifestation of seizure activity included different seizure types, a breed-specific seizure expression was found in the Retriever dog. Furthermore the use of interictal electroencephalography in the confirmation of IE was demonstrated. The results of a long-term treatment study with Phenobarbital in 46 Labrador Retrievers with IE are reported. In addition, the genetical and epidemiological aspects of the disease in each a large Golden and Labrador Retriever dog population were analysed.","1570":"In absence of basic canine hip biomechanics, a specific, consequent three dimensional concept to evaluate the coxofemoral joint was developed for the dog. With the help of a new method to radiologically demonstrate the hip in a physiological standing position several new clinically relevant aspects could be further investigated. For example the breed specific anatomical differences in the hip, and dynamics and the background on \"iatrogenic luxations\" in HD diagnostics could be shown. The caudal luxation and the growth abnormalities of the hip and their consequences on the whole leg (antetorsion syndrome) as a consequence of inadequate breeding could be demonstrated.","1571":"","1572":"The EP vaccine Stellamune Myco was tested in 4 different trials. In a first trial, the daily weight increase and the incidence of lung lesions and their degree of severity were compared in non-vaccinated and vaccinated pigs originating from a herd infected with M. hyopneumoniae. The daily weight increases of the vaccinated animals were almost 60 g above that of the non-vaccinated and the number of altered lungs and the severity of the lung lesions was smaller in the vaccinated group. The effects were statistically different. In a second trial, no lesions were observed in 60% of the vaccinated animals. In the non-vaccinated group, the proportion was only about 35%. More severe lung lesions were only present in the non-vaccinated animals. In a third trial, it was observed that the animals originating from infected herds may excrete mycoplasmas despite the vaccination. In a fourth trial, it was determined that SPF piglets were not protected with the vaccination against an infection caused by M. hyopneumoniae.","1573":"Persistent infection with the Bovine Viral Diarrhea\/ Mucosal Disease Virus (BVDV) can be detected using immunohistological methods. The experiments show that the LSAB (Labeled Streptavidin Biotin) peroxidase method is suitable to detect the BVDV in cryostat sections of unfixed tissue. For the diagnostic work up in living animals, skin biopsies give reliable results. In dead animals, organs such as thyroid gland, skin, mucosa of the mouth, esophagus and abomasum are well suitable for immunohistological BVDV detection.","1574":"One hundred and three calves and heifers persistently infected with BVD virus were examined. The most important clinical findings in order of frequency were weight loss, erosions of the oral mucosa, diarrhea, anorexia and fever. In addition, nasal discharge, lymph node enlargement, erosions of the nose, muzzle and interdigital cleft and bronchopneumonia occurred in less than half of the patients. Furthermore, crustaceous dermatitis was observed in three patients and petechial hemorrhage of the oral mucosa occurred in two other cases with severe thrombocytopenia. Haemoconcentration, leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia and azotemia were the most important haematological findings. To confirm the clinical diagnosis, the serum antibody titre of 69 patients was compared with that of a clinically healthy control animal from the same herd. There was no positive antibody titre in 65 of the 69 patients, whereas 67 of the control animals had positive titres. In 34 patients, EDTA blood samples were collected for virus detection. In 20 of these, skin biopsy samples were also obtained for virus demonstration. Virus has been demonstrated in the blood of 32 of the 34 cases and in all 20 skin biopsy specimens.","1575":"","1576":"This article summarises the clinical findings in 554 birds of prey, that were admitted to the zoo animal and exotic pet clinic of the veterinary faculty in Zurich between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1994. Details on the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis are intended to give the practitioner information on the possibilities for the management of diseased raptors. However, it has to be emphasized that the ultimate goal of treatment has to be the rehabilitation of an animal that will be able to survive to a suitable environment. The data presented shows that 31% of the birds of prey were successfully released. The most frequent reason for admission was trauma and 47% of the patients had one or more fractures. But only one out of three fractures was considered suitable for treatment. The management of birds that are starving is a challenge because they require a special dietary regimen. Successful work in the field of the treatment and rehabilitation of raptors requires detailed knowledge of their biology and medicine.","1577":"A retrospective study of ocular cat claw injuries in the dog revealed an over-representation of very young dogs in our case material. Puppies up to the age of 12 weeks have no menace response. Thus, an important protective mechanism is missing in early life. This may be one reason for the frequently occurring severe ocular trauma caused by cat claw injuries in puppies. Older dogs are less likely to sustain such an injury. Cat claw injuries cause corneal and lens capsule perforation with ensuing severe phacoclastic uveitis. In our series phthisis bulbi or secondary glaucoma were the result in 50% of the cases. In large lens capsule tears early lens extraction may prevent severe uveitis and may retain functional vision.","1578":"Vomiting can be a symptom of serious disease. Although it is important to correctly diagnose the cause of vomiting so the underlying disease can be treated, often antiemetic drugs must be used for the well being of the patient. First the physiology of vomiting with the neurotransmitter receptor system and the neuroanatomical neuron pathway is reviewed. Then a synopsis of antiemetic drugs currently used in veterinary medicine is presented with classification according to receptor antagonism. Finally novel drugs used to control vomiting in human patients and which may play a future role for the veterinary patient are discussed.","1579":"Whitish precipitations in three samples of raw cured ham, which appeared in the stereomicroscope as piles of crystals, were confirmed as tyrosine crystals. Tyrosine is readily soluble in nitric acid (yellowish discoloration) and, after addition of potash lye, it precipitates as yellow-orange picrate. Factors that influence the formation of tyrosine crystals are largely unknown. In raw cured ham of Parma experience has shown that tyrosine crystals are found in ham stored for a very long time.","1580":"Due to the changing conditions of animal production in Switzerland the demand for scientifically based animal health information has increased during the last years. It has become a central element in animal health policy making. National animal health surveillance systems include methods for data collection, analyses, interpretation and information distribution. The current Swiss surveillance systems are presented. In the future, these systems should be more integrated in order to make better use of the available data. The project \"Systems for the recording of animal health in Switzerland\" (SysET) is a proposal how a comprehensive animal data base could be developed.","1581":"Thirty-eight cases (24 dogs, 14 cats) of elbow luxation were reviewed. Seventeen surgical treatments were necessary either after conservative reduction (14) or because conservative reduction was not possible (3). Medial instability of the elbow joint due to medial collateral ligamental damage or avulsion of the origin of the medial collateral ligament were the major indication for surgery. The type and frequency of perioperative lesions as well as their therapeutical and prognostical relevance are described.","1582":"Chemotherapeutic drugs are potentially harmful. It is the task of the veterinarian to minimize the danger to the staff, the owner and the animal and to educate all persons in contact. Potential harm from the use of cytotoxic medications can never be completely ruled out. However the adherence to certain guidelines can ensure that the risks are minimized. In this article practical guidelines are presented and discussed.","1583":"Blood parameters, feed intake and milk yield were determined in 53 cows with a left displacement of the abomasum (LDA) on the day of surgery (ds; laparotomy and omentopexy) and during the following four days (d1-d4). Using histological methods severe (group SF), moderate (group MF) or no\/mild (group NF) fatty liver was found in 32%, 40% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Moderate and severe fatty liver were found almost exclusively in cows in the first three weeks post partum. Post surgery, feed intake and daily milk yield increased steadily in cows of the NF- and MF-group; in cows suffering from severe fatty liver feed intake remained low (p &lt; 0.05). On ds, mean serum levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and glutamic dehydrogenase (GLDH) in SF-cows were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher and values of cholesterol significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the NF- and MF-group; no significant differences were found between the groups in mean serum glucose concentrations. In the four day period following surgery, in all groups mean serum levels of ASAT, GGT, GLDH and cholesterol remained nearly unchanged, whereas total bilirubin, NEFA, BHB and glucose decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). Apart from LDA, 55% of the patients were suffering from mastitis, endometritis or lameness. Within three weeks post surgery, 3 cows of the SF-group and 1 cow of the MF-group developed recumbency and liver coma, and were culled for that reason. In conclusion, post surgical convalescence of cows with LDA is clearly related to disturbances of energy metabolism and fatty liver. Therefore, successful treatment of cows suffering from LDA requires the effective treatment of excessive lipomobilization, ketosis and fatty liver along with the immediate surgical correction of LDA.","1584":"In this paper, a literature review of the 4 most common surgical techniques for treatment of left displacement of the abomasum in cattle is provided, and advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques are described. Many aspects as economy, cosmetics, stage of reproduction, degree of periparturient abdominal edema, availability of assistants, and the surgeons preference determine the decision making process of the technique to be chosen. It is the author's recommendation to perform the left flank abomasopexy in cattle during the last months of pregnancy, the percutaneous toggle-pin fixation as economic procedure in less valuable animals to afford savings to the owner, and the right flank omentopexy in all other cases. Becoming acquainted with the right flank omentopexy has the advantage that this is the technique of choice for correction of right displacement of the abomasum. Ventral paramedian abomasopexy has the distinct disadvantage that 2 or 3 assistants are required to cast and position the animal. Ventral paramedian abomasopexy is, therefore, only recommended in cases, where the cosmetic result plays an important role in the decision making process.","1585":"","1586":"This short review deals with some basic aspects concerning the physiology of the ruminant forestomachs and the abomasum. Following the discussion of the motoric activities, the major aspects of microbial carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism within the reticulorumen are treated. Thereafter, some functions of the abomasum are presented in some more detail. These include the composition of abomasal contents, the mechanisms and regulation of hypochloric acid and enzyme secretion, and the mechanisms responsible for protection of the mucosa against digestion by gastric secretions.","1587":"Abomasal gross anatomy and topography are briefly reviewed and illustrated with emphasis on features relevant to diagnosis and treatment of abomasal disorders.","1588":"","1589":"The purpose of this study was to review ventilation and postoperative analgesic technics in 137 dogs and 13 cats with congenital or acquired heart disease. The animals were referred to the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at The Ohio State University, U.S.A, for the following surgical interventions: correction of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA-ligation, 28%), cardiac catheterization with angiogram and angioplasty (22%), pacemaker implantation (18%), exploratory lateral thoracotomy (8.7%), correction of right aortic arch ring anomaly (3.3%), correction of subvalvular aortic stenosis (2.7%), correction of PDA with coil in patients with mitral regurgitation and congestive heart failure (2%), pericardectomy and removal of heart base tumor (2%), and palliative surgery for ventricular septal defect (VSD, 0.7%). Controlled ventilation was used in all animals during thoracotomy. Anesthesia was maintained over 2.3 +\/- 1.3 hours by using either isoflurane, halothane, propofol, or diazepam-ketamine in 64%, 32%, 2%, and 0.7% of animals, respectively. Postoperative analgesia was necessary in 20% of animals and was provided by using different technics over several hours. The technics and respective percentages of animals in which they were used, were: intravenous buprenorphine (3.3%), intercostal nerve blocks (8.7%), epidural morphine (4%), and interpleural regional analgesia (4%).","1590":"Ophthalmologic examination of 72 Bouvier des Flandres dogs revealed variable degrees of goniodysgenesis in 37.5% of the animals. All dogs examined were normotensive and asymptomatic. Tonography in 4 dogs showed normal c-values for out-flow facility in all of them. Pedigree analysis demonstrated a recessive inheritance. Although the frequency of goniodysgenesis appears to be very high in this breed, the incidence of glaucoma remains low. Genetic counseling and careful selection of breeding stock showed that gonioscopically normal animals can be produced.","1591":"Recent pulmonary lesions at slaughter in bovines affected by Mycoplasma mycoides during the years 1990-1993 in Northern Italy are reported. Several histologic and immunocytochemical examinations showed that: the earliest lesions of CBPP are foci of desquamative bronchiolo-alveolitis, the highest concentration of the antigen is found in the cytoplasm of desquamated alveolar macrophages. From our results, we can exclude that CBPP begins with interstitial lesions as some authors have hypothesized. On the contrary, the hypothesis, formulated at the beginning of the century, that CBPP begins with a desquamative bronchiolo-alveolitis seems to be more convincing. Our results give some help to construct a correct pathogenesis of the disease.","1592":"Clinical, laboratory and histopathological findings are described in ten Braunvieh calves with Spinal Dysmyelination (SDM). Characteristically, immediately after birth the animals were normally alert but remained in lateral recumbency with opisthotonus, spastic hind limbs, partially increased spinal reflexes and were unable to stand or support themselves. Histological examination of the spinal cord revealed a bilateral symmetrical reduction of myelin. Means of differentiating between SDM and other conditions, in particular spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are discussed.","1593":"Genetically directed representational difference analysis (GDRDA) allows to isolate DNA fragments that differ between complex genomes. This approach was applied in the present work to isolate Y-specific bovine sequences. Of eight isolated and cloned fragments, two proved to be Y-specific.","1594":"PCR-based technology used for genotyping microsatellites is going to add new dimensions to parentage control in cattle. In the very near future the determination of microsatellite polymorphisms is expected to replace the former parentage control of conventional blood typing. Parentage control by microsatellite analysis is even more reliable than by the routine haemogenetic procedures. The potential of microsatellite polymorphisms to clarify family relationships is illustrated by 100 cases which could not be solved by conventional blood typing.","1595":"Microsatellite analysis was applied to identify the inbred rat strains LEW, SHR and WKY. Of a set of seven commercially available primer pairs three pairs were used individually and two times two in duplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The products were analyzed in ethidium bromide stained agarose gels. The resulting banding patterns clearly demonstrated the homogeneity within strains and the differences between strains.","1596":"As the number of detected inherited diseases in dogs is increasing, linkage mapping offers an opportunity for the localisation of the responsible genes. In humans microsatellites are ideal markers for constructing high-resolution genetic maps. Twenty-five dog specific microsatellites which are highly polymorphic in mixed dog breeds, were tested by PCR in a group of unrelated Newfoundlands and Bernese Mountain dogs. The polymorphisms found in this two breeds were clearly lower than in the mixed breeds suggesting that only 40% of the markers tested would be useful for linkage analysis. In addition the allele frequencies and distributions differed among this two purebred but related breeds. Our data suggest that a selection for useful markers for each specific breed has to be performed prior to linkage analysis.","1597":"The PCR is now widely introduced as a diagnostic and epidemiological tool in veterinary and human parasitology. Certain parasitic infections are detected using PCR with much higher sensitivity compared to conventional methods, and novel molecular approaches are considered for the analysis of infectiological questions. A broad spectrum of parasites relevant for veterinary and human parasitology already can be diagnosed by PCR. In the present review article, PCR-based methods developped or applied at the Institute of Parasitology in Berne for the detection of protozoan infections (Tritrichomonosis, Neosporosis, Toxoplasmosis) and helminthic infections (Echinococcosis, Taeniosis) are summarized.","1598":"\"Arbitrarily primed PCR\" (AP-PCR) methods are based on the amplification of DNA with arbitrarily selected primers. In the present review article two selected applications of this methodical approach are summarized. Using the RAPD (\"Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA\") technique the genetic variability of different organisms can be analyzed by generating a genomic fingerprint. Echinococcus granulosus isolates (metacestodes) from Spain and Switzerland were comparatively characterized by the use of this molecular epidemiological tool. The following groups of genetically related isolates could be identified: (a) equine isolates (horse\/donkey) from Spain and Switzerland, (b) cattle isolates from Switzerland, (c) goat isolates from Spain and pig isolates from both countries, (d) sheep, cattle and human isolates from Spain. Isolates derived from Swiss patients were forming a separate group with respect to their genetic relatedness. As a further application of the AP-PCR, the development of a novel technique for the construction of cDNA libraries from minute amounts of starting material using an Echinococcus multilocularis metacestode library as an example is presented.","1599":"The application of PCR for the diagnosis and the characterisation of parasites is discussed using four examples. (1) A PCR assay that was developed for the detection of Leishmania was shown to be as highly sensitive as in vitro cultivation of the parasites from lymph node aspirates and bone marrow biopsies. (2) Single eggs of Echinococcus multilocularis can principally be detected and identified by PCR. However, a cumbersome sample preparation is inevitable in order to remove PCR-inhibitory substances present in fox faeces. (3) Analysis of the amplified SSU rRNA gene of Encephalitozoon-like isolates from humans, rabbits and farm foxes confirmed for the first time that E. cuniculi-isolates from humans and animals are indistinguishable and that they are of importance as opportunistic parasites in HIV-infected patients. (4) Swiss isolates of Giardia originating from humans, calves, sheep and a dog could be allocated into three distinct genetic groups by analysing several PCR-amplified genes that encode for variant-specific surface proteins. There was no evidence for the presence of host-specific genotypes.","1600":"RT-PCR and degenerative Oligonucleotide primers derived from conserved cysteine protease sequences were used to amplify seven different Fasciola hepatica cysteine protease cDNA clones (Fcp1-7). Five of the clones showed homology to proteases of the cathepsin L type, whereas two appeared to represent the cathepsin B family. The 5' and the 3' regions of Fcp1 were amplified using the rapid amplification of cDNA Ends PCR (RACE-PCR) protocol. The Fcp1 cDNA fragment was also subcloned in the expression vector pGEX and expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Antibodies, raised in rabbits against the GST:Fcp1 fusion protein, were used in Western blot analysis to examine expression in different life-cycle stages of F. hepatica. In extracts from immature and adult parasites proteins of 30 and 38 kDa were detected. In other stages, proteins of different molecular weight were recognized by anti-GST:Fcp1 antiserum, indicating stage-specific gene expression.","1601":"For the determination of the apx toxin genes in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strains, five PCR reactions were developed which allow the detection of the activator and structural genes and the secretion genes of the toxins ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII. The oligonucleotide primers were chosen in order to amplify characteristic parts of the activator and structural genes apxICA, apxIICA and apxIIICA, and the secretion genes apxIBD and apxIIIBD. The annealing temperature of all five reaction was identical in order to allow the five reactions in a single PCR run. The differences in length between the individual amplified gene fragments allowed all product fragments to be separated in a single electrophoresis. This way, a typical toxin gene pattern could be obtained which is characteristic for the five toxin gene groups of A. pleuropneumoniae including serotypes 1, 5a, 5b, 9 and 11 (group 1), serotypes 2, 4, 6 and 8 (group 2), serotype 3 (group 3), serotypes 7 and 12 (group 4), and serotype 10 (group 5). The identification of the toxin genes, which have significance in virulence, enhance and facilitate differentiation of A. pleuropneumoniae and allow the detection of serotypes with an atypical toxin pattern.","1602":"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification of Taylorella equigenitalis was developed. The oligonucleotide primers are based on the DNA sequence of the rrs gene of T. equigenitalis, encoding for the 16S ribosomal RNA. Analysis of 21 strains of T. equigenitalis from England, USA and Switzerland showed an amplification product of 410 bp with identical Sau3A restriction profile. The sensitivity of the PCR-Assay was estimated to detect 50 to 500 bacteria of T. equigenitalis in a mixture with frequently found contaminants. Further analysis of culture from 60 genital swabs, taken in the course of the control of the contagious equine metritis in horses and donkeys, of experimental assays as well as of two positive cases from the diagnostic showed that this PCR-assay can be used to identify and to detect strains of T. equigenitalis. In addition, preliminary results indicate that the method is also applicable for direct in vitro establishment of the presence of T. equigenitalis in clinical samples.","1603":"In the present work an adapted method of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is described. This procedure was an important tool for cloning a variety of gene sequences derived from oligodendrocytes and canine distemper virus (CDV). Among other applications, the obtained clones were used to produce probes for in situ hybridization and to sequence the inserted DNAs. Due to these molecularbiological techniques new insights were gained into the pathogenesis of CDV-induced demyelination and CDV-persistence in the central nervous system.","1604":"The polymerase chain reaction has all attributes of a promising diagnostic technique. It is rapid, simple to perform and extremely sensitive. In a PCR developed for the detection of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV), we found under ideal conditions a detection on sensitivity up to less than 10 template DNA copies. The diagnostic application of PCR was not fully satisfying, even when the technique was refined by the use of a panel of suitable primer pairs. The reliability of PCR in blood and milk samples was much lower than that of antibody detection using ELISA. Interestingly, a positive PCR result was also recorded in 50% of the samples of seronegative animals. Seronegative lentivirus carriers due to delayed seroconversion have been described previously (Rimstad et al., 1993). Due to sporadic occurrence of false positive reactions in spite of contamination control, this result must be interpreted with caution unless the specificity of the fragments can be confirmed by sequencing. Using published sequences of SRLV, we show that sequencing of PCR products, followed by phylogenetic analysis should allow to study molecular epidemiology of field strains.","1605":"Quantification of provirus copies is important in the context of different biological questions. The most reliable approach for DNA quantification is a PCR based on coamplification of two templates of similar length, the target sequence and the reference template, sharing the same primer recognition sequences. During the amplification, the two templates compete for the same primer set (competitive PCR, or cPCR) AND consequently amplify at the same rate independently of the number of cycles. The amplified products can be distingushed by their different lengths. After densitometrical analysis, the proviral copy number of experimentally feline immunodeficiency virus infected cats could be calculated, since a known amount of reference template was used. The method described here proved to be very sensitive (10 copies for the competitor-DNA) and was used to quantitate the proviral load during several experiments in which the influence of periodical immunestimulations and the effect of vaccines on the virus load was studied.","1606":"A modified method of the reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed in order to examine the genome of a recently discovered virus, the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), which resembled morphologically the coronaviruses. The published sequences of the genomes of various coronaviruses were compared. On the level of the amino acid sequence, conserved regions, common to all coronaviruses, were found in the gene encoding the nonstructural protein 1b as well as in the genes coding for the major structural proteins (S, M, and N). Due to the degeneration of the genetic code, some amino acids may be encoded by different nucleotide triplets. In order to compensate for this degeneration, mixtures of primers were synthesized, containing a variety of nucleotide sequences which together represented all possible codons for the conserved amino acid sequences. This method allowed to amplify and clone approximately 4000 base pairs of the genome of PEDV. An analysis of the genomic sequences revealed that PEDV holds an interesting intermediate position between human coronavirus 229E and Transmissible Gastroenteritis virus. We postulate that the method presented in this contribution may be useful to study and characterize other unknown viruses, especially viruses for which no cell cultures for propagation are available.","1607":"The aim of this study was to further investigate the pathogenesis and epidemiology of feline coronavirus (FCoV)-infections and among others to determine the prognostic value of a positive result in the RT-PCR for FCoV in serum samples collected from cats with abdominal signs. Viral RNA was isolated from 100 microl of serum and subsequently amplified by a nested RT-PCR using primers binding to a highly conserved region of the 3'-end of the FCoV-genome. Sixty-three serum samples collected from 62 cats with abdominal signs were examined by RT-PCR and the clinical outcome was followed up. Four of these cats with a positive PCR-result are healthy more than 70 months after the collection of the blood sample. It can be concluded that viremia with FCoV does not necessarily lead to FIP and death. With respect to diagnosing FIP, a positive FCoV-RT-PCR is of low prognostic and diagnostic value. It can not be recommended to use this assay as sole indication to euthanize cats. Further studies will have to be carried out to demonstrate if the prognostic and diagnostic value of this PCR-assay in other samples such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells is more reliable. However, this method was found to be an important tool to further study the pathogenesis and epidemiology of FIP.","1608":"This paper describes a number of applications of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in the study of enterotropic murine coronaviruses [mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)]. A diagnostic PCR was developed which detected all of 11 different MHV strains. This fast and reliable method was also able to differentiate MHV from other non-murine coronaviruses. On the basis of this assay a quantitative PCR was designed using a mutant template containing a point mutation which competed for the PCR primers. The amplification and cloning of the structural protein genes of enterotropic MHV strains it plasmid vectors for subsequent sequencing is described. In addition an RT PCR was developed which was able to selectivity detect artificially generated recombinant coronavirus.","1609":"As indicated by their nucleotide sequences bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVD-virus) are genetically quite heterogenous. Despite differences in the nucleotide sequence in the NS3 region, we found that the derived amino acid sequence of all viral strains analyzed was identical and differed from that of classical swine fever viruses, thus allowing differentiation between bovine and porcine pestiviruses. Remarkably, the BVD viral strains were isolated over a time period of some 40 years in Europe, North America and New Zealand. The nucleotide sequence of the 5' untranslated genome region of a BVD virus recently isolated in Switzerland from a calf with hemorrhagic syndrome differs from that of BVD viruses causing similar symptoms in a large epidemic outbreak in North America.","1610":"Tick-borne encephalitis virus is difficult to propagate because with consecutive passages in cell culture the virus titer will decrease. Stockvirus has to be propagated in young mice. Therefore, every production of virus for research, diagnostic assays or vaccination demands the use of laboratory animals. We decided to clone the part of the viral genome which codes for the structural proteins, and to produce the structural proteins in a suitable expression system. Using reverse transcription, followed by the polymerase chain reaction, we amplified exactly this part of the viral genome, added restriction sites for cloning and a stop-codon. Cloning of this DNA-fragment and expression of the structural proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus in the baculovirus expression system has thus been possible. Replacement of traditional viral antigen by these recombinant proteins may reduce the need for laboratory animals.","1611":"Since its discovery 10 years ago PCR has been introduced for a variety of practical applications. PCR has opened new dimensions particularly in laboratory diagnostics because of its sensitivity, accuracy and speed. In spite of the availability of user friendly kits, basic knowledge is of great importance for the user especially if PCR has to be optimized for special needs or when specific problems arise. The general mechanism of the reaction and the significance of the reaction components and the PCR conditions are discussed initially. Several recent developments in PCR (new enzymes, RNA-PCR, improvements of the specificity, prevention of contamination and development of new equipment) that are critical for the user are shortly introduced. Finally, \"long PCR\" is discussed in order to demonstrate that even 10 years after the invention of PCR significant new breakthroughs in the PCR technology are still possible.","1612":"","1613":"Two groups of 24 three-day-old turkeys each were inoculated with Eimeria meleagrimitis sporulated oocytes and fed a diet containing respectively 5 and 6 ppm of maduramicin ammonium. Clinical signs, mortality rates, weight gain, intestinal lesions and replication of the parasite were compared to the data obtained from a group of infected, untreated birds kept in the same experimental conditions over a period of 17 days. The treated birds showed better performances and less severe intestinal damages; the replication and the development of the parasite in the intestinal mucosa were impaired and delayed by the drug. All the data were dose dependent.","1614":"Repeated outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in three to fourteen days old calves on a dairy farm gave rise to a detailed description of the induced therapeutic, epidemiological and prophylactic measures. In farms with ongoing problems of diarrhea in calves, its etiology should be cleared. For cryptosporidiosis, which can not be cured by a conventional symptomatic treatment, only Lasalocid-Na is available. In Switzerland the ionophoric polyether antibiotic Lasalocid-Na is available as a food additive (Bovatec, 15% Lasalocid-Na, Hoffmann-La Roche AG). After the establishment of a diagnosis it must be administered as follows: 2 x 6 mg\/kg BW, i.e. 2 x 40 mg Bovatec\/kg BW, daily for three days. The recommended dose has to be respected because of a very high risk of intoxication. Moreover, on contaminated farms strict measures of hygiene, disinfection and cleaning have to be respected. Calving cows have to be kept separated during the calving period and the newborn calves must be separated from the adult cattle unit.","1615":"The case of a five year old Swiss Braunvieh cow suffering from an acute disseminated mycotic pneumonia caused by an Aspergillus fumigatus infection is presented. The animal had calved one month previously and was admitted to the clinic because of recurrent fever. Clinical findings included a reduced general condition, a rectal temperature of 40.6 degrees C, an increased respiratory rate, coughing and serous nasal discharge. On auscultation increased bronchovesicular sounds and moist rales could be heard. Radiographs of the thorax showed a diffuse interstitial nodular pattern throughout the lung. The cow had to be slaughtered in spite of intensive therapy. Necropsy showed multiple nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter covering the entire surface of the lungs. Histology revealed an acute disseminated necrotising bronchopneumonia containing numerous branched, septate fungal hyphae identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. A primary aerogenous infection caused by inhalation of spores originating from mouldy hay or soil was suspected.","1616":"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the coronavirus of the mouse (mus musculus), is one of the most important viral pathogens in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies. It is a highly mutable virus consisting of numerous antigenically distinct serotypes with different pathology. These can be divided according to their tissue tropism into respiratory and enterotropic strains. The course of an MHV infection is dependent on virus strain and host factors. Generally MHV causes an acute, self limiting infection which is inapparent in adult mice. Neonates are highly susceptible to disease and show high mortality. In an enzootically infected colony however, they are protected by maternally derived passive immunity. MHV's importance in biomedical research on one hand stems from its potential as an interfering agent, mainly in the field of immunology. On the other hand MHV serves as a model for coronaviruses of other species including man in studies on virus replication and tissue tropism. Since MHV infections are usually subclinical, detection depends on serological screening of colonies using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence. MHV is controlled by culling and rederivation of the affected colony using hysterectomy or embryo transfer or by elimination by cessation of breeding.","1617":"A chart (62 x 82 cm) for veterinary herd health management based on a hand written card system is presented. The chart serves basic needs especially in small Swiss dairyherds. It is easily understood and immediately installed for the end user, the farmer and veterinarian. Furthermore an EXCEL-based tool is programmed to assist in standard data analyses. This chart meets the needs for documentation in quality assurance programs within dairy production.","1618":"","1619":"Successful application of embryo transfer (ET) has become common practice in cattle, horses, sheep, goats and a variety of other species held in captivity. Yet in cattle only has the technique been established commercially. In 1994 more than 100,000 bovine embryos have been transferred in European countries. Important progress in transvaginal ovum pick up (OPU), in vitro production (IVP) and cryopreservation have further improved the applicability of ET. Direct transfer simplifies the procedure considerably allowing individual transfers and eliminating the need of synchronizing recipients. In Switzerland the organization 'Veterinary Society for Embryo Transfer' (TIGET) has been founded in 1995 to support practitioners performing embryo transfer.","1620":"A 3-year old horned buck of the Toggenburger breed was referred to our clinic with signs of gynecomastia. Cytogenetic abnormalities could not be detected in the karyogram and compared to control animals the buck had normal plasma concentrations of testosterone and estradiol but not prolactin. Hyperprolactinemia has been considered the cause of gynecomastia leaving the semen quality undisturbed.","1621":"We investigated the effect of an acute stressor on body temperature and heart rate in cows. Both parameters were recorded by active telemetry. For the experiments, five cyclic Brown Swiss cows were used, each of them exposed to an acute stressor during estrus and the luteal phase of the cycle. The stressor consisted in restraining the cows in a crush for hoof treatments. During the 2-hour stress period and for additional 6 hours, body temperature and heart rate were measured every 10 minutes. Control animals remained in their accustomed environment during the whole experiment of 8 hours. The course of body temperature and heart rate was clearly influenced by the stressor. While heart rate was maximal already at the beginning of the stress period, the body temperature showed highest values only one hour after stress and then continuously decreased. Changes in body temperature and heart rate under stress differed significantly from the values of control animals. Both parameters are reliable indicators of stress in the bovine species. The transmitters used in this investigation allowed us to register exact data without manipulation of the animal, which could possibly falsify the results. This advantage as well as the functional longevity of the transmitters (ca. 6 months) make active telemetry a useful tool for stress research in farm animals.","1622":"In this study the relationship between peripheral concentrations of cortisol and testosterone was investigated in 7 adult bulls under resting conditions as well as after sexual and hormonal stimulation. The animals were kept under natural photoperiods of 16L:8D and for hormone determinations blood was withdrawn from an indwelling jugular vein catheter every 30 minutes for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Evaluation of the hormonal profiles revealed that both steroids are secreted episodically characterized by irregular, short term fluctuations with high individual variability. A clear circadian rhythm with high levels in the morning and during the day and low concentrations in the evening and during night was observed for cortisol only. Concentrations of both steroidal hormones were not significantly correlated with each other. Intense sexual stimulation (mounting several times with ejaculation) during 30 minutes caused a rapid increase of cortisol without affecting testosterone secretion. After intravenous application of 1500 IU hCG and 0.5 mg GnRH a sharp rise of testosterone concentrations occurred with high values remaining for several hours but leaving the circadian cortisol pattern unchanged. The intravenous injection of 5 mg PGF2 alpha stimulated both the cortisol and testosterone secretion. Results from this investigation show that cortisol and testosterone are secreted episodically without any interrelationship under resting conditions. Sexual stress induced an increase of cortisol which did not inhibit testosterone secretion and high testosterone levels did neither influence the cortisol pattern. The concomitant increase of cortisol and testosterone after PGF2 alpha suggests a central (hypothalamus\/hypophysis) action for prostaglandin.","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"The genetic predisposition to navicular disease is proven nowadays, but otherwise, etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. Causal therapy isn't possible and because of the poor prognosis, neurectomy is still of bearing. This operation was performed already 200 years ago, but in the middle of the last century, critical voices have been raised in regard to the surgical procedure and its indication both for medical reasons and breeding. Clear instructions for exclusion of diseased animals from breeding are also older than one hundred years. These facts call for ethic considerations which concern both breeding and use of these animals. In earlier times, horses were used for basic human requirements mainly, but nowadays their employment occurs mainly for pleasure. Ethic reflections are our task, as our specialized knowledge forms their basis. Our philosophy has to be applicable in practice, what can be achieved best with utilitarianistic reasoning. The possibilities of our influence on the sport are limited, but in breeding our commitment has to be vigorous and unrestricted. Due to the development of immunogenetic studies, legal problems may arise in the near future as well.","1626":"","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"The arteries supplying the left adrenal gland were determined in 12 mature sheep and goats of both sexes and different breeds. The adrenal branches arose from the first and second lumbal arteries in both species but in one goat they originated from the first lumbal artery while in another from the last intercostal artery. The cranial adrenal branches arose from the celiac artery in 8 sheep, both from the celiac and cranial mesenteric arteries in 3 sheep and from the common celiacomesenteric trunk in 1 sheep. In all goats the cranial adrenal branches originated from the cranial mesenteric artery. The caudal adrenal branches arose singly from the renal artery in all sheep and goats. In both species any branch from the aorta or caudal phrenic arteries to the adrenal gland was not seen.","1630":"","1631":"In a 7 year old ram a partly fluctuating mass proximal to the left testicle was diagnosed as varicocele. On ultrasound examination non-echogenic tortuous areas were present. Spermatologic examination revealed an oligozoospermia and an oligokinespermia. Considering the poor prognosis, the ram was slaughtered and the diagnosis of varicocele could be verified on post mortem examination.","1632":"Several metabolites, enzymes and electrolytes in serum samples of horses, cattle and dogs were analyzed in order to verify the applicability of the dry-reagent analytical system VetTest 8008. Electrolyte, substrate and enzyme determinations were performed. The precision within run and the precision within day of the VetTest 8008 were high. The coefficients of variation ranged from 1.2 to 5.1%, with the exception of bilirubin (5.7%), ALAT (25.4%) and GGT (6.7%). The reason for these three high variation coefficients is the low concentration or activity of the used horse serum. The comparative analysis of patient samples with routine methods and multilayer reagent carriers showed good agreement. The linear coefficients of correlation were 0.909 for albumin in bovine sera, 0.828 for calcium in canine sera and ranged from 0.925 to 0.999 for the 14 other components. The VetTest 8008 is easy to use and has been proved to be reliable and accurate. The system is well suited for use in veterinary practice.","1633":"Besides the classical orthopedic examination, radiography and centesis of diseased synovial cavities ultrasonography was applied, for the first time, in 18 cattle for the investigation of proximal bovine limb disorders. The clinical and radiographic findings as well as the results of centesis were compared with the sonographic findings. Arthritis, tenosynovitis, bursitis, abscess formation and haematomas especially in proximal limb regions were observed. A 7,5 MHz linear-scan or a 5 MHz sector-scan were used for ultrasonic examination. By means of radiography, 8 out of 14 cattle showed a soft tissue swelling, whereas specific radiographic findings could only be determined in those cases with affection of joints and bones. The sonographic examination produced more information than radiography when only soft tissues and joints were affected. As a complimentary tool to the classical examination of locomotory system disorders in cattle, sonography provided accurate preoperative details of the extent and character of fluid accumulations and soft tissue swellings. It helped to differentiate rapidly and on a non-invasive basis between affected structures and any subtle defects in neighbouring tissues, it enabled a more accurate centesis of evident fluid filled areas of synovial cavities or other swellings, and revealed much more information than often insufficiently depicted on radiographs. Sonography was, therefore, the imaging method of choice to differentiate pathologic involvement of soft tissue structures in bovine limbs.","1634":"The geographic distribution of bovine hypodermyiasis in the canton Vaud\/Switzerland has been investigated in two ways: By direct examination of the animals by the livestock officers at the 1993 annual census and by ELISA on bulk milk sampled in January 1994. The efficacy of the two methods is compared and the distribution of hypodermyiasis presented on a map. The serological analyses have revealed a highly satisfactory degree of sensitivity and specificity (92.1% and 98.1%, resp.). The epidemiological interpretation however, is rather difficult, partly because quite often the animals are not infested on their farms but rather while being on alpine pastures. A monitoring of the herds with a view to an efficient control of hypodermyiasis could thus in a first instance be based on the indications provided by the livestock officers, whereas a serological monitoring in a second place would allow to detect the last and remaining foci of infestation.","1635":"The purpose of this study was to review the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in 137 anesthetized dogs and 13 anesthetized cats with congenital or acquired heart disease that were referred for correction of following procedures: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA-ligation, 28%), cardiac catheterization with angiogram and angioplasty (22%), pacemaker implantation (18%), exploratory lateral thoracotomy (8.7%), correction of right aortic arch (ring anomaly, 3.3%), correction of subvalvular aortic stenosis (2.7%), correction of PDA with coil in patients with mitral regurgitation and congestive heart failure (2%), pericardectomy and removal of heart base tumor (2%), and palliative surgery for ventricular septal defect (VSD, 0.7%). The anesthetic plan considered the risks of anesthesia based upon the pathophysiology of cardiac lesions and the anesthetic drug effects on the cardiovascular system. Recommendations are made for dogs with decreased cardiac contractility, cardiac disease with volume overload, cardiac disease with pressure overload, and pericardial tamponade. The percentages of animals and their associated cardiac arrhythmias after premedication and during and after anesthesia were: sinus bradycardia (15.3%), sinus tachycardia (3.3%), atrial flutter (0.7%), atrial fibrillation (0.7%), premature ventricular contraction (14%), and ventricular tachycardia (1.3%). Prompt therapy was given to a percentage of animals in order to control arrhythmia and support cardiovascular system, by using atropine or glycopyrrolate (14%), lidocaine (17.3%), and dopamine (14.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1636":"Sero-epidemiological investigations in wild animals may allow to assess distribution of selected pathogens that sometimes seem to be involved in sanitary interrelationships between wild and domestic ungulates sharing the same areas. Serological studies were carried out to investigate the prevalence of antibody against 8 pathogens in Alpine ibex of Albris colony (Grisons, Switzerland). Investigated sera came from 89 animals shot by gamekeepers in 1990-1991. Antibody against smooth Brucella, Coxiella burnetti, Leptospira interrogans, Borrelia Burgdorferi, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, BHV-1 and ovine-caprine lentiviruses were not detected in the tested sera. However, 31% of sera analysed were found to be positive for Chlamydia psittaci. Three sera showed high antibody titres ( &gt; or = 1\/128) suggestive of active infection in the animals. Any influence of Chlamydia psittaci in reproductive performance of free-ranging alpine ibex should be investigated through isolation of the agent. Results are discussed with reference to methods used and with epidemiological picture in Switzerland and were compared with results of serological investigations carried out in ibex in Italy and France.","1637":"The PCR is used for diagnostic purposes as it allows to detect infections agents within a much shorter time than by cultural isolation. In addition, it can detect non-infectious viruses and bacteria in clinical samples. These advantages are important factors in the diagnosis of highly contagious animal diseases (mainly caused by viruses) since a rapid laboratory diagnosis will allow to take immediate disease control actions. PCR is routinely used at the Institute of African and classical swine fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus, Aujeszky's disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, as well as Newcastle disease virus. The isolate can be further characterized by direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified DNA. Since reliability of the results as well as as prevention of contaminations are vital to PCR, this method should be carried out by appropriately trained personnel. In addition, it requires a high level of technical infrastructure.","1638":"","1639":"Intraneuronal vacuoles have been observed in the motor trigeminal nucleus of the medulla oblongata of two dogs which showed neurological deficits. Its significance and possible relation with the same lesions observed in other animal species are discussed.","1640":"","1641":"Metastasis of an adenocarcinoma was diagnosed histologically in a foot pad biopsy of a cat exhibiting progressive locomotion problems, foot pad swelling and nail loosing. A bronchial gland adenocarcinoma was identified as primary tumour at necropsy. Metastases were found in all foot pads, the kidneys and various lymph nodes. A review of the literature and of the own necropsy reports an affinity of bronchial gland carcinoma metastases to skeletal muscles and bones, especially digital bones. Non-respiratory signs as lameness, foot pad swelling and nail loss appear to predominate clinically whereas respiratory signs are observed only in about one third of all cases.","1642":"Malignant melanomas with extensive metastasis in various organs were diagnosed in a 8-year-old European shorthair cat and a 10-year-old Persian cat. The primary tumor in the European shorthair cat was located within the eye. The clinical progress, gross pathology and histology are outlined. The possibility of an increase of melanomas in combination with FIV- or FeLV-infections is discussed.","1643":"Ethology, or the comparative study of behaviour and its biological roots, has made significant contributions to our understanding of companion animal behaviour and thereby, the welfare of these animals. Ethological questions, concepts and methods can be readily applied to companion animal studies and the interpretation of results. In particular, comparison of behaviour shown in a 'reference system' with that exhibited in more restricted environments has proven very useful. Although emphasis has been placed on farm animals in the past, more and more animal protection laws require that regulations and guidelines, including those concerning companion animals, be based upon sound ethological studies. It is only through such observations that we can objectively determine what 'species-typical' behaviour is and what the animal's 'needs' are. Based upon these, recommendations for proper housing conditions can be made, which in turn reduce the number of cases where behavioural disturbances tarnish the relationship between humans and their companion animals. Using past research on the domestic cat and human-cat interactions, the author illustrates these points and makes suggestions for future research.","1644":"","1645":"We analysed 595 cows in 20 herds for serological evidence of paratuberculosis with an ELISA procedure for which we had recently determined a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 98%, and we obtained an overall calculated real prevalence of 5.99%. In two herds with clinical cases of paratuberculosis, the calculated true prevalence of seroreactors was 21.47%. In 9 herds with clinical suspicion of Johne's disease, the rate was 4.23%, 9 herds without any clinical suspicion showed a mean prevalence of 0%. Whereas the trend was clear for groups of herds, the observed prevalence in individual herds varied from 0% to 17.9%, without obvious association with manifest clinical problems of paratuberculosis.","1646":"","1647":"","1648":"","1649":"Four (in some cases five) broiler flocks for every of the five lighting programs (LP) with artificial light (A: 24 hours light = 24 l, 0 hours dark = 0 d; B: 16 l, 8 d; C: 14 l, 4 d, 2 l, 4 d) and with daylight (D: 16 l, 8 d; E: 16 l, 8 d with twilight) were investigated at the age of 3-5 (KB), 28-30 (U1) and 38-40 (U2) days and during catching action. The birds kept in the LP C showed a significantly better feathering than the birds in the other LPs and the birds in the LP B a better than the birds kept in A, D and E. All the parameters describing locomotion showed a decreasing mobility during fattening. In the LP A locomotion was significantly more disturbed than in the other LPs. Tests to investigate the nervousness of the flocks never induced panic reactions. The birds of LP A reacted always less active than the other birds, except in the flash light test. No problems occurred during catching actions in all the flocks. Fattening performances and the results from the slaughter houses for the birds kept in 24 hours light (LP A) were not better than for the birds kept in the other LPs.","1650":"An increase of the intraosseous pressure is observed in the epiphyses of bones involved in degenerative joint disease. The increase of pressure may be caused by an accumulation of osmotically active substances in the interstitium as it has been described in case of the Compartment Syndrome. Based on the postulated pathophysiological mechanism a causative therapy of the degenerative joint disease is proposed.","1651":"Determination of antibodies against Eubacterium suis (E. suis) in the serum of pigs was carried out by an indirect immunofluorescence test. Therefore 35 sows with urinary tract infections as well as 43 healthy control sows were investigated. E. suis could be detected in the urine of 19 sows. Serological results were compared with the bacteriological examinations. To reach a specificity of 100% for detection of animals actually infected with E. suis, titres from 1:16++ can be accepted as positive. Therefore sensitivity gave a level of 78.9%. Seroconversion and development of antibody titers were studied on 15 sows, which were experimentally infected with E. suis. Antibodies could be shown 3 weeks after infection at the earliest, they were preferably demonstrated in sows with a haemorrhagic cystitis. No correlation existed between the affection of the kidneys and the development and the level of titres respectively. Serological investigations can turn out negative in spite of E. suis infection, if immunological response still has not taken place or development of antibodies has failed to appear after short-time infection of the bladder.","1652":"The combination of a fracture of the proximal tibia (Salter-Harris type II) with an avulsion of the tibial tuberosity is a rare injury in the growing dog. Internal fixation of the tibial plateau with K-wires, in some cases combined with a tension band wire for the avulsed tuberosity, resulted in complete healing. There is the possibility of developing growing deformities, therefore control radiographs should routinely be taken in 10 days intervals.","1653":"Recently, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was identified as one of the major causes of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy in several species. The hormone probably has an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of mammals and birds. Many endocrine, paracrine and autocrine functions are attributed to PTHrP. Parathormone shares the same receptor with PTHrP. This receptor was isolated in many tissues. PTHrP could be an important fetal growth factor. The influence of PTHrP on calcium homeostasis is presently the object of active research. PTHrP stimulates calcium transfer through the placenta and maintains a concentration gradient between the dam's blood and the fetus. The hormone is produced in large quantities in milk. However, its exact and principal function in lactation has not yet been determined. Among other effects, PTHrP might stimulate the secretion of calcium, phosphate and magnesium in milk and might foster the development of the mammary gland. A role of PTHrP in the pathogenesis of postparturient paresis in dairy cows has been hypothesized. Results of recent trials demonstrate that despite an important role in calcium homeostasis, PTHrP is not pivotal in the development of milk fever.","1654":"Although contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) has not been diagnosed in Switzerland since 1895, anti-CBPP antibodies were detected in several cattle that had been imported from Switzerland to Italy. In order to clarify the current disease situation in Switzerland, detailed epidemiological investigations were performed, including the control of 200,000 slaughter cattle in 108 abattoirs and serological testing of more than 2200 animals from 134 farms. The data collected in the slaughterhouses showed a prevalence of suspect lung lesions of 0.04%. Yet, the causing agent of CBPP Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC could not be isolated from any of these 84 microbiologically analysed lungs. On the other hand, up to 3.5% positive results were obtained from the serological tests. These results are most probably caused by cross-reactions of other mycoplasma. Based on these data Switzerland is still to be considered free of CBPP. Nevertheless, a continued surveillance programme including routine checks of all cattle carcasses at the abattoir and subsequent epidemiological investigation of suspect cases are recommended.","1655":"A calf with a dark red, cauliflower-like mass in its oral cavity was referred to our clinic.

They were considered non specific.","1659":"The purpose of this study was to review the effects of sedatives and anesthetics in 137 dogs and 13 cats with congenital or acquired heart disease which were referred for diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical interventions: correction of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA-ligation, 28%), cardiac catheterization with angiogram and angioplasty (22%), pacemaker implantation (18%), exploratory lateral thoracotomy (8.7%), correction of right aortic arch (ring anomaly, 3.3%), correction of subvalvular aortic stenosis (2.7%), correction of PDA with coil in patients with mitral regurgitation and congestive heart failure (2%), pericardectomy and removal of heart-base tumors (2%), palliative surgery for ventricular septal defect (VSD, 0.7%), and sick patients with deleterious cardiac arrhythmias (0.7%). The anesthetic plan considered the risks of anesthesia based upon preoperative patient assessment, classification scheme for functional phases of heart failure, and anesthetic drug effects of the cardiovascular system. The effects of sedatives and anesthetic drugs on determinants of cardiac output are described. The most commonly used drugs for premedication, induction, and maintenance of anesthesia were midazolam-oxymorphone (20%), thiopental or etomidate (30%), and isoflurane (64%). Prompt therapy was given to control arrhythmias and provide organ perfusion, pain relief, muscle relaxation and renal diuresis, using lidocaine, dopamine, fentanyl, atracurium, and furosemide in 17.3% 14.7%, 12%, 10%, and 8.7% of animals, respectively.

Clinical examination revealed a high packed cell volume (PCV) of 72%, a haemoglobin concentration of 24.9 g\/l and 15.2 millions erythrocytes\/microliters. Despite continuous intravenous infusion therapy with large volumes, the PCV never decreased to a physiological level. The animal showed a normal appetite and no signs of discomfort or syncope. Arterial blood gas values were in the normal range as well as the concentration of erythropoietin (measured by radioimmunoassay, RIA). A test for neoplasms (carcino-embryonic antigen, CEA) was negative. The liver enzymes of the animal were extremely elevated and a liver biopsy showed a severe fibrosis. Examination of sternal bone marrow aspirate revealed no abnormalities. Based on these findings, the presumptive diagnosis was \"absolute polycythaemia\". The animal was treated for 7 days with repeated phlebotomy. During this time, the PCV never decreased below 50%, despite no obvious signs of discomfort from the animal. Because of the poor prognosis based on the liver biopsy result, the animal was euthanized 11 days after hospitalization. Post mortem findings were: a granular cell myoblastoma with a diameter of approximately 5 cm in the lungs, severe fibrosis of the liver, mild acute tubular nephrosis in the kidneys, activation of the erythropoietic cells in the bone marrow and thrombosis of the abdominal aorta. The possibility of secondary polycythaemia due to the lung neoplasia was not entirely excluded, but considered to be unlikely. Therefore, the definite diagnosis was polycythemia vera.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1661":"In the present study the breath hydrogen (H2) excretion test was combined with the xylose absorption test in 4 normal horses and 9 clinical patients with chronic diarrhea (n = 3) or chronic weight loss without diarrhea (n = 6). All horses underwent a thorough clinical examination. Laboratory evaluations consisted of haematology and serum biochemistry as well as bacteriological and parasitological examination of feces. In addition, serum electrophoresis and abdominocentesis was performed in all the clinical patients. Gastroscopy was carried out in 6 patients and rectal biopsies were obtained from 4 animals. Two animals were euthanized within 4 weeks after the evaluation. The diagnosis of chronic granulomatous enteritis was confirmed in one of them at necropsy, the cause of weight loss in the other remained unexplained. In the remaining animals, specific causes such as management, parasites, chronic infections and diseases of liver, kidneys and heart were excluded, but no specific diagnosis could be obtained. For the combined xylose absorption\/H2 excretion test, the animals were starved overnight and given 0.5\/kg\/bwt xylose as a 10% solution by stomach tube the next morning. Blood samples were collected for plasma xylose analysis at 30 min intervals for 4 hrs, and breath samples were also collected at 30 min intervals for 8 hrs. With the exception of the animal with granulomatous enteritis, the diseased horses showed only slight alterations in either peak concentrations or times to reach peak levels of plasma xylose. None of the healthy animals showed an increase in breath H2 production after xylose administration, whereas five of the diseased animals showed distinct increases of variable heights. In addition, the diseased horses showed higher fasting breath H2 levels (range 7.5-61.5 ppm) than normal horses (range 0-5 ppm). It is concluded that gastrointestinal disorders might be influenced or even induced by a change in intestinal microbial composition, as evidenced by an increased hydrogenic metabolism.","1662":"","1663":"This is a case report of a six-year-old female White Alpine sheep with a cardiac fibrosarcoma in the right atrium.

Chronic congestion of the liver resulted in increased hepatic enzyme activity. Based on clinical findings, a tentative diagnosis of endocarditis or pericarditis was made. Radiography of the thorax revealed hydrothorax. An echogenic mass was observed in the right atrium via echocardiography; it was interpreted as a tumor or thrombus. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed severe ascites and chronic congestion of the liver attributable to right-sided cardiac insufficiency. The clinical and sonographic findings were verified at post mortem.

The possibility of making an early diagnosis and a attempt for prevention are discussed. Blood values in a population of racing Greyhounds are compared with data of the literature.","1666":"At their entry into the animal domicile, \"La Stampa\", in Lugano (canton Tessin), 217 stray dogs and 154 unwanted dogs were examined for infections with intestinal parasites, filariae, Babesia and Leishmania. The following techniques were used for detection of intestinal parasites: combined sedimentation-flotation, MIFC technique and scotch tape adherence test. Prevalences of helminth egg excretion in stray dogs and in unwanted dogs, respectively, were as follows: 34% and 22% for Trichuris, 17% and 14% for Toxocara, 3% and 5% for hookworms, 4% and 0% for taeniids. Dipylidium, Toxascaris and Capillaria were diagnosed sporadically. Samples positive for taeniids were further tested for the presence of Echinococcus coproantigens in a sandwich ELISA: one of 9 dogs was strongly positive. This dog was euthanized for security reasons and upon dissection, 11 Taenia hydatigena and more than 10,000 gravid Echinococcus granulosus worms were found. Microfilariae were detected in the blood of 3 stray dogs and one unwanted dog by the Difil-test. In all 4 cases the infective species was Dirofilaria immitis as confirmed by morphology, acid phosphatase activity analysis of microfilariae and by detection of specific antigens in blood plasma by ELISA. Specific antibodies against antigen of Leishmania infantum could not be detected in any of these dogs by ELISA. However, 3 stray dogs had specific antibodies against antigen of Babesia canis as demonstrated by IFAT.","1667":"In order to ascertain the importance of Campylobacter spp., C.difficile, C.perfringens and Salmonella as agents of bacterial gastroenteritis in dogs, two groups of animals were studied prospectively. The first group consisted of 77 puppies in 14 litters, with fecal cultures performed weekly for 10 weeks, starting at birth. The second group consisted of a kennel population with every dog cultured at entry, and at two-month intervals thereafter. Incidence of Campylobacter spp. was 32 and 31 per 100 dog-month of observation for healthy pups and healthy adult dogs respectively, 46 and 0 for C.difficile, 51 and 36 for C.perfringens and 6.5 and 1.3 for Salmonella. The incidence of Campylobacter spp. in pups peaked at 8 weeks of age. This incidence (43 per 100 dog-months) was higher in pups reared together with older dogs than in pups reared without contact to other dogs (0 per 100 dog-months). Toxigenic strains of C.difficile were found in 61.5% of the healthy neonate dogs. None of the cases of non-watery and non-inflammatory diarrhea we observed was associated with any of the pathogens studied. Furthermore newly acquired colonization with Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella was never associated with episodes of diarrhea. No conclusions could be drawn about the role of bacterial pathogens for causation of watery or inflammatory diarrhea which were not observed in our study.","1668":"Cases of abortions in cattle were investigated using several different laboratory procedures. The purpose was to collect information on an individual animal and on a herd basis that would allow a correct etiological diagnosis and also the institution of prophylactic measures. The cause of the abortion was diagnosed in 30% of the cases and in 16.3% of the herds. Due to the complexity of the problem, there is no routine diagnostic procedure that can universally be recommended and applied. There was no association between the number of tests performed or the number of herd mates included in the diagnostic work-up and the diagnostic success rate. In order to make a more efficient use of the diagnostic procedures, a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to abortion, on an individual animal basis and on a herd basis, is required.","1669":"Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis and aspiration of bile were attempted in 176 cows. These same procedures were performed in another 100 cows immediately after slaughter. The bile samples were examined microscopically for large and small liver fluke eggs. In addition, a fecal sample from each cow was examined for liver fluke eggs. The findings of both groups were summarized, and the results of the fecal and bile sample examinations were compared. In all cows the liver was examined for flukes, and the results were used as a reference. Of 41 cows in which adult flukes were found in the liver, 28 had F. hepatica eggs in fecal samples and 40 had F. hepatica eggs in bile samples. Of 204 cows in which no adult flukes were found in the liver, 23 had F. hepatica eggs in fecal samples and 27 had F. hepatica eggs in bile samples. The sensitivity of the determination of F. hepatica eggs in fecal and bile samples was 68 and 98%, respectively. The negative predictive values for fecal and bile examination were 93 and 99%, respectively. Of 49 cows in which adult flukes were observed in the liver, 13 had D. dendriticum eggs in fecal samples and 44 had D. dendriticum eggs in bile samples. Of 176 cows in which no adult flukes were found in the liver, 19 had D. dendriticum eggs in fecal samples and 49 had D. dendriticum eggs in bile samples. The sensitivity of the determination of D. dendriticum eggs in fecal and bile samples was 27 and 90%, respectively. The negative predictive values for fecal and bile examination were 81 and 96%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the examination of bile is clearly a more reliable method of diagnosing liver fluke infections than microscopic examination of feces.","1670":"In 33 pregnant cows a fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) using an external lead was recorded during second stage of labor. A curve of the fetal heart rate pattern was drawn which served to determine the following parameters: basal heart rate, and amplitude as well as frequency of heart rate oscillation. These parameters were compared with APGAR scoring, colostrum intake, blood gas analysis as to their value for evaluation of vitality. There was a statistically positive correlation between basal heart rate during birth and base deficit after birth. Basal heart rate was negatively correlated with plasma pH measured after fetal expulsion. Amplitude of heart rate oscillation was negatively correlated with pH in plasma and concentration of standard bicarbonate, and was positively correlated with carbon dioxide pressure and base deficit. Calves with acidosis at birth or decreased colostrum intake had statistically significantly higher amplitudes of oscillation than healthy control calves. Basal heart rate of the fetus when used as the only parameter might not be suitable in order to exactly evaluate fetal vitality. In contrast, amplitude of heart rate oscillation more reliably indicated a disturbance of fetal condition. Under practical conditions, the described procedure of measuring fetal ECG is suitable in order to detect a viable fetus.","1671":"The current discussion on \"semi-natural\" or \"extensive\" animal production and husbandry shows that such terms are vague and are often used for various meanings. This paper addresses what can be referred to as natural environmental conditions from an ethological point of view, as well as the animal's environment in today's animal production, and how \"near to nature\" animal husbandry can realistically be. Apart from some outdoor systems with few ethological problems, the predominant part of milk and meat production in the future will still largely take place indoors. Thus, the development of housing conditions which are more appropriate to the animal's needs will still be an important issue of farm animal behaviour science. Consequently the essential environmental requirements of cattle and pigs derived from their species-specific behaviour are described and explained. In the future, an improved fulfillment of ethological requirements will lead to increased group housing in cold and open, structured barns with indoor straw-bedded lying compartments and integrated outdoor feeding and activity areas. This process will also be influenced by ecological, economic and technical aspects. Finally, several studies on cattle and pigs are presented which demonstrate the possible benefits from more appropriate housing systems or the fulfillment of single ethological requirements regarding behaviour, health, fertility and production of the animals.","1672":"","1673":"","1674":"Causes of variation in animal experiments include differences in the genotype of the animals as well as a number of environmental factors. Through standardisation of the physical, chemical and biological components of the environment the quality of the results of the experiments can be improved, which in turn leads to a reduction of the number of animals used. One of the means to achieve this goal is the use of specified pathogen free (SPF) animals. To assure the microbiological quality of these animals the population and its environment needs to be screened thoroughly on a routine basis. This publication describes the necessary quality assurance procedures. These include bacteriological, parasitological, virological and histological examinations of the animals themselves, as well as environmental screens such as microbiological examinations of feed, control of water quality or the testing of the efficacy of disinfectants.","1675":"","1676":"The application of a PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) vascular graft for palliative surgical treatment in a case of tetralogy of Fallot in a dog is described.

Clinical retrospective studies showed the presence of arthrosis in 50% of the cases treated with closed reduction (Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 1991) and persisting medial instability after the reduction in more than 50% of the cases. In the present study, the biomechanic of both medial and lateral collateral ligaments was analyzed after selective severing of those ligaments. Severing of the medial collateral ligament led to an average increase of the pronation of 30 degrees with the presence of crepitus on the lateral aspect of the elbow during passive motion. The medial instability of the elbow could be evidenced clinically as well as radiographically. Severing of the lateral collateral ligament resulted in an average increase of the supination of 15 degrees. No evidence of subluxation could be diagnosed using palpation or radiology. Craniocaudal stressed radiographic views of the elbow in pronation are the most helpful to document damages of the collateral ligaments of the elbow.","1678":"This report describes a two-year-old White Alpine ram with suppurative pleuropneumonia and a lung abscess. Prior to admission, the ram had been unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics and levamisole. Clinical examination revealed that the general behaviour and condition of the ram were severely disturbed. The rectal temperature and respiratory rate were increased. Auscultation of the lungs revealed increased vesicular sounds. Based on clinical findings, a tentative diagnosis of bronchopneumonia was made. To confirm the diagnosis, blood was taken for serological testing for Maedi-Visna, and endoscopic examination of the respiratory tract and ultrasonographic and radiographic examination of the thorax were performed. Cytologic and bacteriologic examination of tracheal secretions revealed large numbers of neutrophils and Actinomyces pyogenes organisms. A pocket of gas, surrounded by a capsule of soft tissue density, overlying the base of the heart, and a horizontal fluid line were observed on radiographs. Ultrasonographic examination revealed an effusion between the pleura and the lung on the left side of the thorax; an encapsulated abscess was seen on the right side of the thorax. Centesis and aspiration of this accumulation of fluid yielded foul-smelling pus. Post mortem examination confirmed the clinical, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings. The ram had severe chronic suppurative pleuropneumonia with abscess formation between the pleura and lung on the right side.","1679":"Whereas fasting is well tolerated by the healthy organism, protein-energy malnutrition in the sick animal has a negative impact on organ functions, immunocompetence, wound healing, and reconvalescence. Sick animals, physically unable to eat or held off food for medical reasons for more than 5 days, consequently need some sort of nutritional support. Force feeding through a gastrostomy tube has several advantages compared to other forms of enteral nutrition. Gastrostomy tube feeding is relatively physiological, is quite comfortable for the animals and their owners, can replace oral feeding for weeks, and is associated with only rare complications. Gastrostomy tubes can be placed surgically, by use of a gastroscope, or blindly. Blind percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement is minimally invasive, fast, does not require any expensive equipment, and hence is well suited for practice.","1680":"The technic for the ultrasonographic evaluation of the canine adrenal glands is described and illustrated.

Clinical conditions are discussed which require tests with high sensitivity and\/or specificity. In addition it is shown that the prevalence of a disease is an important factor for the predictive value of a test result. For instance, tests with good specificity will lead to a high proportion of false negative values if the prevalence of the disease detected by the test is low. In order to improve the predictive value of a positive test result, the clinician must try to assign a patient to a population of individuals in which the prevalence of the suspected disease is elevated. This can be done by carefully evaluating the history and the clinical signs.","1684":"First we describe the application of an injection anaesthesia in a specific strain of rats and test its usefulness under practical conditions. Application (i.p.) of the described dose according to the animals body-weight resulted in an acceptable anaesthesia, which lasted approximately 50 minutes in male rats and 80 minutes in female rats. Next we compare the common ether anaesthesia with an other inhalation anaesthesia (Methoxyflurane) which, by using a self-made mask, could be prolonged without any problem for at least 15 minutes (\"prolonging-time\"). A correlation was found between the duration of the prolonging-time and the awakening time. Inhalation anaesthesia using Methoxyflurane obviously affected the animals health and well-being less than the conventional ether anaesthesia.","1685":"The influence of dietary biotin in horses with brittle hoof horn and chipped hooves was investigated in a long-term study, which was performed over a period from one to six years. 97 horses received 5 mg of biotin per 100 to 150 kg of body weight, per os, daily; 11 horses were not supplemented with biotin and served as controls. The hooves of all horses were evaluated macroscopically every three to four months. Hoof horn specimens of the proximal wall were examined histologically and physically in 25 and 15 horses, respectively. The tensile strength of normal coronary horn was 60 N\/mm2 or greater; it was reduced in areas of histological alterations, the lowest value being 20 N\/mm2. The hoof horn condition of the biotin-supplemented horses improved after eight to 15 months of supplementation as determined by macroscopic and histologic examinations. The hoof horn condition of most control horses remained constant throughout the study. The growth rate of the coronary horn of horses supplemented with biotin and of control horses was the same. The hoof horn condition deteriorated in 7 of 10 horses after biotin supplementation was reduced or terminated. It was concluded that biotin should be continuously supplemented at the full dosage in horses with severe hoof horn alterations.","1686":"Hematologic reference values were established in 18 healthy foals in the first two months of life. Blood samples were collected prior to colostrum consumption and at 30 hours, 1 week, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks of age. PCV, Hb and RBC decreased during the first week and RBC, but not PCV and Hb, increased toward the end of the second month. With the exception of the sample at 1 week, the foals had mean RBC values significantly higher than those of controls. Mean MCV and MCH did not change during the first week, but decreased slightly thereafter; all means were smaller than in controls. The numbers of neutrophils increased mainly during the first week, and the numbers of lymphocytes increased gradually during the first two months. The mean N:L-ratio was highest at 1 week and lowest at 5 weeks.","1687":"In lambs, adult female sheep and wethers the influence of the intravenous injection of ascorbic acid (AA) in a dose of 10, 20 or 30 mg\/kg body weight (b.w.) on the concentration of AA in the plasma up to 420 minutes thereafter was analysed. Further the concentration of glucose respectively of cortisol in the plasma was determined in some experiments. The results can be used as a basis for investigations in sheep with infectious and parasitic diseases for the determination of the degree of the saturation of the body with AA. For therapeutic purposes the repeated application of a dose of 20 mg AA\/kg b.w. is recommended. In wethers a dose dependent excretion of AA in the urine after an i.v. injection of a dose of 10, 20 or 30 mg\/kg b.w. was observed. The injection of ACTH, cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline had no substantial influence on the concentration of AA in the plasma. In the course of 24 hours there was no alteration in the concentration of AA in the plasma.","1688":"Because of the anatomical position of the Corpus luteum within the ovary, rectal palpation is of little value for identification and evaluation. The aim of this review is to familiarize the practitioner with the echographic examination of the Cl. He should be able to recognize different stages of this important structure and to correlate ovulation and the existence of the Cl. Various specific criteria and details regarding equine echography are reported and illustrated, using the the most recently published scientific data.","1689":"","1690":"Twenty-eight immature male rabbits were divided into four experimental groups and administered a standard diet containing respectively 0, 15, 75 and 150 ppm of triphenyltin acetate (TPTA) for 70 days. The highest dose group showed a decrease in erythrocyte count, haemoglobin content and packed cell volume. As early as on day 35, leucopenia and lymphopenia were recorded in all treated groups, thereby confirming the well-known immunosuppressive activity of organo-tin compounds. Both total serum protein and albumin levels apparently altered by TPTA treatment. Conversely, there was a dose-dependent increase for both alpha 2-globulin fraction and blood urea nitrogen serum levels, suggesting a possible renal involvement.","1691":"Ophthalmoscopic examinations of 276 Entlebucher Mountain Dogs between 1987 and 1992 revealed a high incidence of inherited ocular diseases in this particular breed. A posterior polar cataract was seen in 42.4% of dogs examined. This cataract develops between one and two years of age and is in the majority of cases stationary. Development of mature cataracts was noticed in 8% of dogs with polar opacities. A progressive retinal degeneration (rod\/cone-abiotrophy) was observed in 24.9% of the dogs examined. The fundus abnormalities are comparable to other forms of retinal degeneration, such as hyperreflectivity of the tapetal fundus, attenuation of the retinal vasculature, depigmentation of the non tapetal fundus, and pallor of the optic disc. Visual deficits were first seen at the age of 3 years, the majority of affected dogs going blind between 6 and 8 years of age. As a third suspected inherited ocular disease glaucoma was seen in 3.3% of the dogs examined. Glaucoma affects older animals. In the nine cases examined by gonioscopy goniodysgenesis was observed. Initially, glaucoma occurs unilaterally, but the opposite eye may also become affected, in which case animals go blind. Pedigree analysis revealed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the cataracts and the PRA, whereas the mode of transmission is unclear for the glaucoma. 11.9% of the dogs examined had more than one inherited eye disease.","1692":"","1693":"","1694":"The authors describe pathologic and histopathologic findings of three cardiac aneurysms in horses, two of which in the left ventricle and one in the right ventricle. The aneurysms were always associated with multiple foci of myocardiac fibrosis. A hypothesis concerning histogenesis of the lesion is formulated.","1695":"Results and experience of 38 applications of the small AO\/ASIF external fixator in cats are reported. Problems, limits with this fixation system and possible further indications are discussed. In this study the external fixator proved to be a helpful supplement of stabilisation methods for treatment of fractures and luxations in cats. The external fixator was well tolerated by the cats in this study.","1696":"Sensitivity and specificity of two ELISA systems for the detection of antibodies to Bovine Herpes-virus 1 (BHV1; IBR\/IPV) were tested by using 214 sera of cattle with predetermined history of BHV1 infection and freedom from BHV1 infection, respectively. With these sera as \"gold-standard\", the sensitivity of ELISA1 (HerdCheck: Anti-IBR) appeared to exceed 98%, whereas for ELISA2 (Checkit: Trachitest) a sensitivity of between 94 and 99.3% was determined. The specificity of ELISA1 amounted to at least 96.9%, whereas for ELISA2 it ranged apparently from 81.5 to 98.5%. When applied in routine testings of serum samples, the two ELISA systems correlated extremely well. With each test, only 3 of 1431 samples gave contradictory results. In all these cases, alternative tests suggested that the contradictions represented false-positive reactions. A similar correlation was observed when milk samples in the place of sera were probed. The serum and milk samples were additionally tested using two corresponding ELISA systems (obtained from the same manufacturers) for the detection of antibodies to Bovine Leukemia virus (BLV). The sensitivity and specificity of these tests could not be determined because of lack of samples with known history of infection. The results of the tests, however, correlated very well. Only 6 of 1431 sera reacted in a contradictory way. These observations indicate that the kits tested in this study, both for the detection of antibodies to BHV1 and to BLV, meet high quality standards. Possibilities to improve the kits were still detected.","1697":"The quality of the horn of the cattle hoof varies in the different segments of the ground surface adapted to weight bearing. Horn quality is influenced by the following main factors: the keratin proteins as the most important intracellular factor, the intercellular cementing substance as the intercellular factor, and the architecture of the cluster of horn cells, i.e. the arrangement of horn cells in tubular and intertubular horn. Differences in the structure and composition of these factors and their respective combination determine the different degrees of hardness of hoof horn, which are even palpable. In special places, as i.e. the white zone, the combination of all these above-mentioned factors determines sites of predilection for diseases of the cattle hoof like white line disease.","1698":"The discovery of all four horseshoes in connection with the horse-skeleton (see IMHOF: \"Discovery of a skeleton of the 17th century in Kiesen\/Switzerland\") made it possible to determinate its age by the radiocarbon method indirectly. The horseshoes are fully documented with pictures and scales and the findings described and discussed in detail.","1699":"In 1968 a skeleton of a horse was found in Kiesen (Switzerland). This discovery could be dated by radiocarbon method: According to that this 13 years old gelding with a withers-height of 135 to 140 cm must have lived during the first third of the 17th century. Apparently it died by an accident. The bones are fully documented with pictures and scales and the findings described and discussed in detail.","1700":"","1701":"During archaeological excavations of the former knackers yard in Emmen (Canton Lucerne) skeletons and individual bones of more than 700 animals were recovered. 110 bone samples had lesions and were examined macroscopically and radiologically, 100 were from horses, 9 from dogs and only one from cattle. According to morphological and etiopathogenetical criteria, lesions are presented in the following groups: tooth irregularities (10), degenerative changes in bones and joints due to overload and aging (80), trauma and infection (10), other lesions (10). Over 80% of pathological bone samples presented degenerative changes: spondylosis and spondylarthrosis, arthropathies (mainly spavin and ringbone in horses) and ossifying periostitis due to mechanical stress (Periostitis of phalanx I and periostitis of the dorsal cortex of the third metacarpal bone).","1702":"","1703":"The duty of the flayer was to dispose of horse and dog offal that was not intended for consumption. In addition he was to see to the disposal of animal carcases. The steady increase in the numbers of horses and dogs as well as devastating diseases, obliged the authorities to improve the control on the flaying of animals. A better knowledge of the dismembering of animals and improved diagnostic capabilities were expected of the flayer. Despite the greater importance of his duties, however, the flayer remained at the bottom of the social ladder. It was only during the era of enlightenment that he became an accepted member of society. Thus emancipated, he was able to leave his accustomed working place and attempted to gain entry into the realm of veterinary medicine. These attempts were sometimes met with success.","1704":"This case report describes a 6-year-old Holstein Friesian cow with extrahepatic cholestasis. The most prominent clinical signs were disturbed general condition and behaviour, icterus, yellowish brown urine, and bilirubinuria. An increased concentration of serum bilirubin and an increase in hepatic enzyme activity were the most important laboratory findings. Ultrasonographic examination of the liver and gall bladder revealed severe bile stasis. The intrahepatic bile ducts, the cystic duct, and the gall bladder were severely dilated. Histological examination of a liver biopsy revealed cholestasis, cholangitis, and acute hepatosis. A liver abscess was also found at post mortem examination. It was assumed that cholestasis was caused by the inflammatory products resulting from cholangitis.","1705":"Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. mycoides LC (large colony type) (MML) was isolated from three 2 to 6 weeks old wild goat kids (Capra aegagrus cretica) dead of septicemia in a Swiss zoo. Necropsy revealed peritonitis, pneumonia and enteritis. MML was isolated out of the ear canal of most of the healthy animals in the flock. The high density of the animals, the presence of concomitant diseases and the carriage among healthy animals seem to have been important predisposing factors for the MML-infection.","1706":"A Siberian Husky from the Milan region was referred to the Clinic for clarification of a history of weight loss and rapid fatigue. On clinical examination increased vesicular sounds and dyspnea after physical excitement and effort were the only abnormal findings demonstrable. Radiologically demonstrated changes of the pulmonary arteries led to a tentative diagnosis of Dirofilariosis. The parasitological diagnosis based on serology and the morphology of microfilariae isolated from the blood indicated an infection by microfilariae and adult stages of Dirofilaria immitis. After premedication with Aspirin, the patient was treated against adult filariae with Caparsolate, and a month later with Ivermectin against the microfilariae. At the time of reexamination, 5 months after initiation of therapy, the dog was clinically healthy and free of any demonstrable infection with Dirofilaria. In a second, clinically normal Husky from the same kennel, isolated Dirofilaria repens microfilariae were demonstrated. This dog was not treated.","1707":"Primary hypothyroidism is commonly associated with lethargy, alopecia, hyperpigmentation, alterations in skin and hair coat, anestrus and bradycardia. However, there is also a neurological manifestation of hypothyroidism with neuromuscular signs. Four dogs with generalized polyneuropathy are described. Two dogs had peripheral vestibular signs, two other lower motor neuron disease with megaesophagus. Diagnosis was based on neurological examination, TSH-stimulation test and electrodiagnostic findings including electromyography, motor nerve conduction velocity and brainstem evoked potentials. On histological examination lymphocytic thyroiditis was diagnosed in two cases. Three dogs recovered after supplementation with Eltroxine (Levothyroxine) and one dog was euthanatized because of megaesophagus and concomitant aspiration pneumonia.","1708":"","1709":"We have developed an alternative model for combined \"in vitro\" functional and morphological studies on the rat pituitary gland. To test its use for biochemical investigations we studied some aspects of the secretion in pituitary thyrotrophs under basal conditions and after stimulation with TRH. After stabilisation of basal TSH release, the stimulation with TRH significantly increased the TSH secretion. To test the usefulness of our model for morphological investigations the tissue was processed for conventional and immunocytochemical light and electron microscopy at the end of the incubation. Different types of pituitary cell resulted to be well preserved. Our model allows combined biochemical and morphological studies on the pituitary gland and thus reduces the number of animal groups, eliminates the extrapolation of results from different groups and replaces the \"in vivo\" by an \"in vitro\" experiment.","1710":"In 80 calves presented with clinical signs of umbilical disease, the umbilicus was examined by palpation and by ultrasonography using a 5 Mhz or a 7.5 Mhz sector scanner. Diagnosis was confirmed during surgery or at post mortem examination. The various diseases of the intraabdominal umbilical structures found in these calves and the therapeutic procedures performed are described in detail by use of schematic representations, photographs of anatomical preparations, and ultrasonograms. In 29 calves with an enlarged extraabdominal umbilicus, ultrasonographic examination provided additional information to determine the choice of therapy, and it was particularly helpful in calves with irreducible hernias and with umbilical abscesses. In 51 calves with diseases of the intraabdominal umbilical structures, an exact description of the extent of the disease and of the involvement of other structures, as the liver and the urinary bladder, was made possible by ultrasonography. In calves with omphalitis, early recognition of the involvement of intraabdominal umbilical structures could be determined. Umbilical ultrasonography can be performed easily and is a very reliable and informative aid not only in the diagnosis of umbilical disease but also in determining the choice of therapy. Additionally, the owner can be informed in advance about the expense and the prognosis of the planned therapy.","1711":null,"1712":"Crenosomiasis is a pulmonary parasitic disease of the dog, endemically occurring in Switzerland, which is to differentiate from other forms of therapy-resistant chronic cough. The diagnosis is obtained by fecal examination (larval migration, Bearman's technic) or by cytologic examination of the tracheobronchial mucus. Levamisole is the drug of choice for the treatment of this disease.","1713":"The effect of the time of administration of the Paratect Flex -Bolus (PF-Bolus) on the course of infections with gastrointestinal nematodes was investigated in a field experiment with three groups of 9 first year grazing heifers in the Swiss midland region. The heifers of groups A and B received the PF-Bolus at turnout on May 7 (early season application) and on July 16 (late season application), respectively. The heifers of group C remained untreated. All heifers were grazed together throughout the experiment. The mean egg excretion of the heifers of group A remained very low for a period of 70 days and peaked at the end of September reaching a mean value of 167 eggs per gram of faeces (epg). After the administration of the PF-Bolus to the heifers of group B, the egg excretion was reduced by 97% and remained below 50 epg for the rest of the season. While the mean serum pepsinogen values of the heifers of groups A and B only reflected subclinical infections, the mean values of the heifers of group C exceeded 4400 mU tyrosine and 4 heifers exhibited signs of parasitic gastroenteritis. At the end of the experiment (Oct 8) heifers of group A were 14 kg heavier than the controls (not significant) whereas the heifers of group B outperformed the control heifers by 20 kg (significant, p &gt; 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1714":"Infections with the Bovine Viral Diarrhea\/Mucosal Disease Virus (BVDV) are widespread and cause a variety of diseases including reproductive disorders, abortion and malformation, pneumoenteritis, thrombocytopenia and mucosal disease. Together with the closely related border disease virus of sheep (BDV) and European Swine fever virus (CSFV), also referred to as Hog Cholera virus, BVDV is now classified in the genus pestivirus of the Flaviviridae family. The BVDV exists in two biotypes, noncytopathic and cytopathic, the latter differing in structural proteins from the noncytopathic biotypes. In virus-free animals infection is transient and mostly subclinical or mild but may also lead to an array of diverse symptoms such as pneumoenteritis (often in combination with other microorganisms). Infection of the developing fetus early in gestation with a noncytopathic biotype of BVDV may result in persistent infection and birth of apparently healthy calves. Such calves may later in their lives develop Mucosal Disease, a lethal course of infection associated with a mutation to the cytopathic biotype or superinfection with a cytopathic BVDV antigenically similar to the non-cytopathic virus already present in these animals. Diagnosis of infections with BVDV is based on the clinical symptoms and demonstration of virus. Paired serum samples allow the detection of seroconversion in acute infections while persistently infected animals are immunotolerant and generally lack antiviral antibody. Although generally found in their respective host species, pestiviruses of cattle, sheep and pigs are capable of crossing the species barrier into the other species. The existence of pestiviruses in wild ruminants and boars may complicate control strategies that are aimed at removing virus carriers and the control of animal movements.","1715":"","1716":"We report cases of adverse reactions, some of which serious, of four frequently used therapeutic substances in several animal species. In order to avoid similar cases we discuss special measures or alternative therapies.","1717":"For many decades trichinellosis has not been reported among Swiss domestic pigs. Considering the fact that Trichinella occurs in a sylvatic cycle in Switzerland, a study was designed to reevaluate the present epidemiologic situation by investigating 10,904 fattening pigs, 218 pigs with free access to pasturage or being kept on an alp, 104 domestic boars, 106 horses, 44 wild boars and 538 foxes using a direct and an indirect diagnostic technique (digestion method and serology with ELISA and an excretory\/secretory antigen, respectively). The digestion method was performed according to EC-guidelines. Furthermore, 25,239 sera originating from a Swiss sow-serum bank were tested retrospectively for anti-Trichinella antibodies. Trichinella was not detectable in all domestic pigs using the digestion method. Serologically, 3 fattening pigs (0.027%) and 9 sows (0.036%) demonstrated weak antibody reactivities against the Trichinella E\/S-antigen. Based upon statistical calculations for the negative-positive threshold, these antibody-reactions were considered to be within the normal range of variability of the test. Although statistically restricted, the results of the present study indicate the absence of Trichinella within the Swiss pig population. Based upon the rational applicability of the ELISA and its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, this test appears as the most suitable method to perform large-scale screenings among slaughter pigs. Pigs with free access to pasturage and boars were all parasitologically and serologically negative for Trichinella. The digestion method showed that horses and wild boars were all parasitologically negative, whereas 1.3% of the foxes were positive for Trichinella larvae.","1718":"In this case report a multiple ligament injury of the stifle in a dog is described.

Various specific criteria and details regarding the equine echography of ovarian abnormalities are reported and illustrated, using the last scientific data published on that particular topic.","1720":"Volvulus is the torsion of an organ around its pedicle (Garnier et al., 1990). In the dog, the volvulus of the stomach is well known, and the volvulus of the small intestine is rare (Carberry et al., 1989). Volvulus of the whole colon has been described once in a rough collie (Marks, 1986). Only two cases, both in great Danes, of torsion of the caecum and the proximal colon have been mentioned (Carberry et al., 1993). A third case, also in a great Dane, is thereafter described.","1721":"A new recombinant FeLV vaccine was evaluated in 30 specified pathogen-free cats 10 months of age cats. The vaccine consisted of the non-glycosylated FeLV envelope protein p45, aluminium hydroxide and a saponin adjuvant. The cats (n = 18) were vaccinated twice intramuscularly, 3 weeks apart. All animals were challenged intraperitoneally with FeLV subgroup A, 18 weeks later. While 94% of the vaccinated cats showed no viraemia or were only transiently viraemic, 80% of the non-vaccinated animals became persistently viraemic within 2 to 3 weeks. In our hands the preventable fraction of the vaccine was 93%. In order to determine the effect of a pre-existing infection with feline immunodeficiency virus on the efficacy of vaccination, 50% of the cats were previously infected with FIV. The infected cats were protected to the same degree as the non-infected animals. With prolonged duration of FIV infection the probability increases, that the immune system of the cat will fail and clinical signs will appear. In order to observe a state of possible immunodeficiency, an accurate clinical examination of every cat prior to vaccination seems of major importance.","1722":"","1723":"Baytril with the active ingredient enrofloxacin was given to four dogs in a single intravenous and oral dose of 5 mg\/kg body weight. Measured plasma concentrations were different depending on the method of analysis used. Using high performance liquid chromatography quantitative determination of both enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin is possible whereas antimicrobially active substance is measured by bioassay. Ciprofloxacin occurred early in the concentration-time curves after intravenous and oral administration of the parent drug enrofloxacin with cmax 0.2 and 0.3 microgram\/ml, respectively, at tmax 2 and 4 h, respectively. Areas under the curve (AUC) calculated from concentration-time-curves with bioassay data are overestimated, because ciprofloxacin may be more active than enrofloxacin against E. coli 14 (ICB 4004) used in this test. Thus, pharmacokinetic parameters which are derived from AUC-values are overestimated, too. Oral bioavailability calculated with bioassay results was more than 100% whereas availability of enrofloxacin was only 53%. Clearance was 10.3 ml\/min.kg (antimicrobially active substance) and 27.1 ml\/min.kg (enrofloxacin). Elimination half life was 3.7 and 2.4 h, respectively.","1724":"This article describes the general principles of radiation therapy, reviews the indications for this treatment modality and discusses the response of tumors and normal tissue to radiation.

Aim of the study is to get an overview about actual husbandry systems, and to allow some evaluation of application of ethological knowledge in practice. The results concerning different dimensions of system-details are interpreted widely being full-filled in terms of animal welfare legislation (Switzerland). Concerning more qualitative requirements it is found that application of animal welfare knowledge should be increased.","1726":"A sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 98% were obtained in the evaluation of a serological method (commercial absorbed ELISA, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Parkville, Australia) for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis. The population used in the study consisted of 20 infected, suspect and non-infected herds from the region of the Plateau de Diesse. Another evaluated non-absorbed ELISA test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 91%.","1727":"Postmortem investigation was performed on 54 scouring (soon after onset of diarrhea) and 23 healthy suckling piglets. The animals were 1 to 4 weeks of age and were collected from 27 herds. In 21 herds diarrhea had been observed for a long time in piglets in this age group. Coccidia were found in 34 piglets, rotavirus in 2, cryptosporidia in 2, enterotoxigenic E. coli in 6, attaching and effacing E. coli in 1, Cl. perfringens type C in 1, Campylobacter coli in 53 and C. hyointestinalis in 8 piglets. Some of these microorganisms were isolated from healthy piglets as well. TGE- and PED-Virus antigen, as well as Salmonella were not recovered from any of the pigs. Results of the histopathological and enzyme histochemical investigations were in agreement with data from the literature. They confirmed and emphasized the role of coccidia as enteropathogenic agents in the animals examined. On the other hand evidence was shown, that C. coli is non-pathogenic. The role of C. hyointestinalis could not be fully elucidated. At least one sort of enteropathogenic agent was detected in about 68% (n = 37) of the scouring pigs or was present in 81% (n = 17) of the herds, respectively.","1728":"The public discussion concerning animal health not so much relates to classical diseases but rather concentrates on problems likely to result from the demand on the yield of animal production. Both, animal health and animal production have a high social value. A conflict might arise from those situations when animal production seems to interfere with animal health. Since the definition of an animal as healthy is not only a matter of science but also of ethics, also requiring a risk-benefit-analysis, the question of an acceptable denominator in respect to the ethics involved is put forward. The concept of a relative anthropocentric approach is presented, making a distinction between human dignity and the well-being of animals. The prospect in treatment and handling of animals should be an increase in humanity and only justifiable reasons would allow interference with animal development and its social environment. By profession the veterinarian is predestined to protect animal health and he is summoned to accept this responsibility and to objectively apply his expertise, also to further develop the propositions of modern European legislation on animal welfare. In this respect the demand on animal yield put forward by animal breeding requests special attention.","1729":"","1730":"","1731":"In an analysis of autopsy findings from 16,384 pigs (1980-90) 436 cases of haemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS) were found (2.66% of autopsies). In most cases fattening pigs (in the weight of 25-100 kg) were affected. HBS was significantly more frequent in females. Intestinal volvulus was confirmed in 56.2% of all cases of HBS, however by more careful examination between 1988 and 1990 even in 80% of cases. In most cases the degree of torsion was 180 degrees and the direction as seen with the pig lying on its back was anticlockwise. Clinical history as reported by owners revealed limited information: sudden death of one or several pigs within three months, association with whey feeding not uncommon. Significantly more cases of HBS were seen during spring and on mondays. Numerous yeasts could be detected in mucosal impression smears of ileum, colon and caecum. Additional analyses in six farms suffering from big losses due to HBS suggested that several environmental and management factors may be involved pathogenetically: feeding only once a day of excessive amounts of a liquid diet, especially whey (a highly fermentable substrate), poor hygiene of liquid diets (high bacterial counts and yeast concentrations). In mixed breeding and fattening units, the aforementioned factors could be responsible also for sudden deaths in dry sows caused by colonic bloat often associated with intestinal rupture and torsions of the stomach and\/or the spleen.","1732":"Between 1988 and 1990, selenium concentrations were measured in the serum of 188 calves admitted for various conditions to the University of Zurich veterinary hospital, and in 64 healthy calves that served as controls. The lowest mean concentration was measured in the controls and it was 14.5 micrograms\/L. The mean concentrations in patients not previously supplemented with selenium for the three years were 29.1, 27.5 and 23.0 micrograms\/L, respectively, and the concentrations in the patients after supplementation were 61.7, 88.7 and 72.6 micrograms\/L, respectively. The differences between the two groups of patients, and between controls and calves of 1989 without selenium supplementation were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between mean selenium concentrations of calves of different age groups or between calves of different disease groups. Selenium concentrations were not correlated with blood pH, plasma protein and fibrinogen concentrations. The low values measured in untreated calves paralleled results of previous studies in calves and cows in Switzerland.","1733":"Bacteria of Group EF-4 were isolated in 7 dogs and in 5 cats from local purulent lesions in areas of natural openings of the head and from bite wounds, from lungs with focal necrotizing pneumonia in 2 additional cats and from internal organs in a badger with septicemia. The organisms grew mostly in pure culture. In conventional biochemical tests, 12 isolates were shown to belong to biovar EF-4a and 3 isolates to EF-4b. Classification as Group EF-4 was confirmed by assimilation tests performed with the commercially available gallery ATB 32 GN. Results of this study indicate that in veterinary medicine, bacteria of Group EF-4 are not only important from an epidemiological point of view, but that they may be more pathogenic for animals than considered hitherto.","1734":"Tyzzer's disease, caused by Bacillus piliformis and characterized by a multifocal, necrotizing hepatitis was diagnosed in a 25 days old, male, German warmblood foal. The animal was submitted to the clinic of horses because of colic symptoms and a severe depression. Upon arrival it was comatose, recumbent and showed opisthotonos. Due to a severe, metabolic acidosis and a rapid progression of the disease, the foal was euthanatized. In immediately formalin-fixed tissue samples Bacillus piliformis was detected in the cytoplasma of hepatocytes by different histological techniques (Giemsa stain, silver impregnation technique by Warthin-Starry, immunohistology). This case is discussed within a literature review.","1735":"The establishment of a Porcine Health Service (PHS) was pioneered in the early sixties. After reviewing the history of the formation of the PHS, a few examples of how it stimulated research in several fields in our two faculties are given. The development of the PHS was noticeably slowed down by yearly recurrent \"mysterious\" outbreaks of actinobacillosis and especially enzootic pneumonia. Epidemiologic investigations have since shown that the reintroductions of these pathogens can occur by airborne transmission. This information filled the last important gap in the battle against these economically and public health important diseases. Simultaneously it became apparent that enzootic pneumonia and actinobacillosis are not merely herd problems but epizootics which can only be eradicated by means of modern disease control legislation. The question is posed whether or not the PHS, which is potentially a valuable tool in the hands of the state veterinarians, should continue to remain under the control of the producers.","1736":"","1737":"","1738":"Measurement of the plasma concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone in six bitches on 180 consecutive days showed large fluctuations in the levels of both hormones. The concentrations of oestradiol began to increase 10-12 days before the peak levels of 38.1-89.7 pg\/ml were reached, then declined again over the next 3-7 days to or below the minimum measurable value of 9 pg\/ml. On the day after the maximum concentrations of oestradiol were recorded, plasma progesterone began to rise rapidly, reaching a plateau after approximately two weeks, then declining gradually after a further two weeks. At the height of the luteal phase, peak levels of 12.6-70.1 ng\/ml were measured, although on some days values of less than 1 ng\/ml were recorded. The time of occurrence of the initial rise in the progesterone concentration during oestrus presumably indicates that preovulatory luteinization had taken place. During anoestrus the basal concentration of progesterone was generally less than 1 ng\/ml and that of oestradiol less than 9 pg\/ml. The normal values derived from these observations are discussed with regard to the interpretation of oestradiol and progesterone concentrations in domestic pets under treatment in veterinary practice.","1739":"The clinical findings of seven \"White Alp\" rams are discussed. Six of the animals contracted Brucella ovis and exhibited signs of illness. The seventh animal indicated no Brucella ovis contact. The ejaculates of all rams showed significant changes. A spermatocele, typical for Brucella ovis, could be proven, pathologically and anatomically, in only one case. Brucella ovis was isolated from two samples. A brief discussion on the treatment of herds infected with Brucella ovis is included.","1740":"The range and type of ventrodorsal motion between two adjacent vertebra (L3-S1) was analyzed on isolated vertebral columns of 13 German Shepherd Dogs. All except one were neurologically normal dogs. The movement from maximal flexion to maximal extension was divided into 5 degree steps. For each step, the center of motion was determined on laterolateral radiographs. It could be shown that mobility between two adjacent vertebra within the lumbar spine increases towards the lumbosacral region with the highest mobility in this joint. In the cranial portion of the lumbar spine, rotation and ventrodorsal (parallel) displacement between two adjacent vertebra was seen. Rotation dominated in the lumbosacral joint in 11 dogs, whereas parallel displacement was mainly seen in 2 dogs. Further studies on pathologic and surgically modified vertebral columns are necessary to clarify the significance of these findings in the pathogenesis of lumbosacral instability and cauda equina compression in the German Shepherd Dog.","1741":"","1742":"","1743":"In feeding and balance trials with dogs (4) dried, ground carrots were tested in addition (30%) to a basic dry food (rice, corn gluten, fish meal and supplements). The palatability of both mixtures was good: fecal water losses were increased after feeding the carrots. Apparent digestibilities of organic and inorganic matter, especially sodium and potassium (not phosphorus), decreased. Digestibility of carrots was calculated to reach 70% with 1.2 MJ of digestible energy per 100 g dry matter. Reduced fecal pH (6.9--&gt;6.1), higher lactate concentrations and increasing excretion of volatile fatty acids were seen as results of the stimulated bacterial metabolism in the colon. Diurnal pattern of breath hydrogen exhalation was similar in both periods: renal excretions of phenol, indican, and nitrogen were significantly reduced after supplementation with carrots as compared to control period.","1744":"","1745":"","1746":"","1747":"","1748":"","1749":"Oestrus was induced in 14 anoestrous beagle bitches by intramuscular injection of PMSG in a dose of 20 I.U.\/kg once daily on five consecutive days, followed by an additional single i.m. injection of 500 I.U. of hCG on the fifth day. The day on which the first injection was given was counted as Day 1 of the experiment. Between the fourth and sixth day, the bitches began to attract the attention of male dogs and between Days 9 and 15 all bitches came in heat. Matings occurred on two to ten occasions, and six of the bitches conceived. The maximum concentrations of oestradiol in the plasma were in most cases reached on Days 10 or 12 and ranged from 42 to 195 pg\/ml. In all cases progesterone concentrations rose sharply between Days 10 and 20. The incretion phase of the corpora lutea was noticeably brief in the non-gravid bitches; in five of these eight bitches, anoestrous values below 2 ng\/ml were already obtained before the 65th day of the experiment. These results indicate that the administration of PMSG on five consecutive days supplemented by a final single injection of hCG stimulates the ovaries adequately to afford good prospects of conception. The concentrations of ovarian hormones are discussed.","1750":"1014 Swiss housecats have been blood typed. 99.6% had blood group A and 0.4% had blood group B, with no type AB cats detected. The transfusion of blood, or the transfer of antibodies to newborn kittens through colostrum, can cause clinical signs of incompatibility. Because almost all B-cats have high naturally occurring antibody titers against the other blood group, it is the B-cat which is most likely at risk to have incompatibility reactions after a blood transfusion and it is the B-queen which has high antibody titers in the colostrum. In the contrary only about one third of the A-cats have antibodies and usually in low titers. The present investigation demonstrates that the incidence of blood type B in Swiss housecats is very low. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a minimal risk for incompatibility reactions due to blood transfusions. The same could be said of neonatal isoerythrolysis which is unlikely to occur with the random mating of housecats.","1751":"The aim of the present study was to determine ultrasonographically the size of the umbilical structures in clinically health newborn calves and to evaluate their involution during the first three weeks of life. A total of 13 ultrasonograms were obtained in each of 20 healthy newborn calves using a 7.5-Mhz sector scanner transducer placed across the linea alba of the abdominal wall. The umbilical vein was imaged at five defined cross sections from the umbilicus to the portal vein in the liver, whereas the urachus and the umbilical arteries were imaged at four defined cross sections from the umbilicus to the pelvis. The umbilicus was scanned at three defined locations. All ultrasonographic cross sections were compared to those of a frozen newborn calf. The results were further tested against in a single examination of 20 different calves between 2 hours and 34 days. Standardized ultrasonographic examination is a safe and reliable method to image the umbilical structures in calves. The umbilical vein was imaged between the umbilicus and the caudoventral margin of the liver in calves up to three weeks of age. The umbilical vein, which at first was oval and thin-walled with a wide anechoic center (vertical diameter 11 +\/- 3 mm and horizontal diameter 19 +\/- 7 mm), diminished in diameter during the first week of life to 5 to 8 mm. The course of the umbilical vein in the liver was imaged in calves up to two weeks of age. The umbilical arteries could only be clearly imaged during the first seven days of life. They had a mean diameter of 8 +\/- 2 mm and were seen as round, thick walled vessels with an echogenic to hypoechoic center. In all calves, the urachus was not well-defined and was difficult to image. The data of the umbilical structures accumulated in this study can be used as a reference in the diagnosis of abnormalities of the umbilical structures in young calves.","1752":"Between 1982 and 1991 3403 diseased and dead rabbits from the field were dissected. The most important findings were intestinal coccidiosis (24.1%), dysentery (20.5%), liver coccidiosis (6.9%), mucoid enteritis (5.0%), acute pasteurellosis (4.2%), pneumonia (4.0%), rhinitis (3.6%) and adiposis (3.3%). The incidence of these diseases is similar to the most important rabbit diseases in other European countries. Short recommendations on prophylactic and therapeutic measures are given.","1753":"Production liability, safety regulations as well as marketing strategies are important motivations for companies to establish in-house quality control measures which can be certified by an independent control body. Companies that advertise quality control measures place pressure on opposition companies to follow suite. It follows that certification in foodstuff production will lead to a chain reaction and spread quickly to other companies. In the establishment of a quality assurance system it is just as important to distinguish between quality control and quality assurance as it is to consider the guidelines laid down in the ISO-Standards 9000-9004. After certification according to the ISO-Standards, which dictates certain forms of quality assurance, there is no guarantee that all important risks, such as hygiene risks introduced with technology, can be excluded. In terms of public health monitoring an important responsibility awaits veterinary public health. Strategies and consequences for official monitoring of foodstuffs are presented and discussed.","1754":"","1755":"","1756":null,"1757":"This study is concerned with the correct use of the scientific zoological nomenclature for domesticated and laboratory animals. With the help of four tables, additionally, the most current latin names of all important domesticated animals (animals of economic importance, ranch-bred animals, companion animals, fancy animals, laboratory animals) are given. The authors suggest a formal nomenclature for domesticated animals which should principally be related to the scientific name of the parent species (binomially and in italics), as always followed by the completion \"forma domestica\/f. dom.\" (not in italics). Problems arising from the use of such scientific names when hybridization and introgression is concerned are also discussed, and appropriate nomenclature is proposed.","1758":"Few scientists predicted the impact that echography would have on the equine breeding industry. The aim of this practical review is to give the practitioner the ability to be familiar with the ovarian echographic exam. He should be able to recognize different stages of estrous cycle in the mare, status of preovulatory follicles and to predict precisely the time of ovulation. Various specific criteria and details regarding the equine echography are studied and illustrated, using the last scientific data published after the Fifth International Symposium on Equine Reproduction in Deauville.","1759":"","1760":"The combined drug Mebendazole plus Trichlorfon (Telmin plus Trichlorfon, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse\/Belgium) has been tested in a field trial against naturally acquired Gasterophilus spp. infestations in horses. 44 foals (1 to 1.5 years old, 350-450 kg body-weight) originating from different endemic areas of Switzerland, have been randomly allocated to two groups as follows: 28 foals were treated with Mebendazole plus Trichlorfon, 16 animals served as untreated controls. The drug (paste) was administered and dosed according to the user's instruction. Macroscopic examinations of the digestive tractus and the larval counting has been performed immediately after slaughtering, i.e. 30 and 33 days after treatment, resp.. The efficacy of the product against Gasterophilus spp. amounts to 97.04% which is considered as highly effective. A further proof for the high efficacy is the observation of a lot of larvae-carrying foals in the control group. Since the larvae of Gasterophilus spp.--according to their life cycle--are essentially found in their hosts between November and February, an appropriate treatment should be performed during that period of time.","1761":"The clinical signs, changes in blood and rumen fluid, findings at laparotomy, therapy and course of disease of 23 cows with obstruction or compression of the duodenum are described. The duodenum was obstructed by a phytobezoar in 14 cows and by a blood clot in one cow. In eight cows, the duodenum was compressed by and adhered to a liver abscess. The most important clinical findings included moderate to severe disturbance in the general behaviour and attitude, markedly reduced gastrointestinal activity, no or greatly reduced defaecation and abomasal reflux with metabolic alkalosis. Ten cows were slaughtered after clinical examination or exploratory laparotomy. In 13 cows, the phytobezoar was compressed manually to facilitate normal elimination, and if this was not possible, the phytobezoar was removed by enterotomy. Postoperative therapy consisted of intravenous administration of a solution containing sodium chloride and glucose, potassium chloride and intramuscular administration of metoclopramide, procaine penicillin and flunixin meglumine for three to five days. Two of the treated cows were slaughtered a few days postoperatively. There was a rapid improvement in the remaining 11 cows, and general condition, appetite and defaecation returned to normal within a short time.","1762":"In the present study the effect of Flunixin meglumine (FM), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, was investigated on postpartal prostaglandin production and uterine activity in the cow. For that purpose 8 cows were given FM in a dose of 2.2 mg\/Kg b.w. twice daily (08.00 and 16.00 h) for the first 10 days p.p. Blood samples were collected at various times before, during and after parturition and the concentrations of 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF2 alpha (PGFM), progesterone as well as adrenaline and noradrenaline determined. Eight cows served as controls. Uterine activity was measured by means of pressure microsensors and electrodes which were surgically implanted into the uterine wall before parturition. During the whole treatment period FM inhibited endogenous PG-production by more than 80% (p &lt; 0.05). The suppressive effect of FM was maximal 4 h after the last injection and lasted no longer than 8 h. PGF2 alpha-suppression clearly decreased spontaneous uterine motility and reduced the myometrial response to ocytocin (5 IU i.v.) and PGF2 alpha (15 mg i.v.). Treatment with FM did not interfere with uterine involution, the return to cyclicity and the first postpartal cycle length. Also, no obvious effects were seen on catecholamine concentrations which fluctuated during parturition without regularly representing the actual stress situation. Our results demonstrate that FM is able to effectively inhibit PGF2 alpha-secretion as well as uterine activity in the cow. Further evaluation of FM as a tocolyticum or in the treatment of uterine infections is required.","1763":"A case of acute hepatic necrosis in a dog is clinically and pathologically described. The occurrence of Clostridium perfringens in the liver lesions was revealed by histological examination and bacteriological isolation. Based on these findings we conclude that Clostridium perfringens is the cause of the infarcts. The case is discussed on the base of the literature.","1764":"","1765":"In dog fetuses aged of 45 and 55 days as well as in dogs and cats of different ages the body weight and the concentration of ascorbic acid in different tissues were analysed. In the liver, the highest concentration was determined in the dogs aged 28 days (432 +\/- 71 micrograms\/g wet weight) and in the cats aged of 42 days (474 +\/- 85 micrograms\/g). In the cerebrum the highest concentration was found in dog fetuses aged 55 days (821 +\/- 75 micrograms\/g) and in cats aged 1 to 3 days (888 +\/- 56 micrograms\/g). In the kidneys and in the M. longissimus dorsi, the concentration was also in part age-dependent. The concentration in the adrenals of dog fetuses was lower than that after birth: the highest concentration was analysed in dogs aged 28 days (1780 +\/- 340 micrograms\/g) and in cats aged 6 months (1497 +\/- 203 micrograms\/g). The significance of ascorbic acid for the development of the tissues of carnivores is discussed and compared with the concentration in other species.","1766":"The nervous supply of the teat and udder skin of the bovine was examined by means of the AChE-reaction. In comparison to the silver impregnation method, a rich subepidermal fibre-network with intra-epithelial nerve endings and, especially, a strongly developed nerve fibre meshwork associated with muscle fibres was seen.","1767":"Six pregnant sows were treated in early pregnancy, late pregnancy and during lactation. Four empty sows served as control. Marbofloxacin was administered (2 mg\/kg body weight) intravenously and orally. The active drug concentration in the plasma was quantitated by use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microbiological assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by use of a noncompartment model. In lactating animals, the concentrations in milk were also determined by HPLC. Mean elimination half-life of the drug after oral administration was significantly shorter in lactating sows (5.74 h) than that of the early pregnancy group (10.09 h). Total body clearance was highest in the lactating sows (3.27 ml\/minute.kg body weight). The volume of distribution was large in all physiological states studied indicating good tissue penetration. Bioavailability was about 80% in pregnant and lactating sows. Antimicrobial secretion in milk contributed greatly to marbofloxacin elimination. These results indicate an important influence of lactation on marbofloxacin pharmacokinetics in sows. Therefore, in such cases, the antibiotic dose should be increased during lactation.","1768":"In the first part general principles and indications for external fixator use in cats for treatment of fractures and luxations are described. This study considers only one of many external fixator systems. The results of the clinical use of this system in cats are described in the second part of this investigation. Technical aspects, post operative care, implants removal, possible complications and their therapy are discussed.","1769":"In 1990 and 1991 4522 blood samples from 398 pullet flocks and 1338 blood samples from 128 laying flocks were monitored for antibody against infectious bronchitis virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, adenovirus, reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, Newcastle disease virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae. The results are discussed for pullets and laying hens.","1770":"The glandular chambers in the spongy zone grow out of the superficial endometrial glands during the implantation of the embryo. To our knowledge, no scanning electron microscopic investigations of the spongy layer in the placenta of the bitch have been published so far. We examined the placenta at the 44. day of pregnancy by scanning electron microscopy. The glandular epithelium in the spongy zone forms extensive folds, which fill up most of the lumen of the glandular chambers. They are lined by a simple columnar epithelium with high apical protrusions. The luminal surface of the cells is bordered by short microvilli. Numerous vesicles are stacked in the cytoplasm. The tips of the chorionic tufts project into the lumen of the glandular chambers. The lumen is filled with masses of mucus separating the trophoblast from the glandular epithelium. With respect to its morphology, the trophoblast lining the tips of the chorionic tufts is very different from the trophoblast in the other parts of the placenta. The cells are swollen and club-shaped. The cytoplasm is completely supplanted by big vacuoles. We feel that the trophoblast in the glandular chambers is unable to perform any resorptive activity. The significance of the mucus in the glandular chambers in stopping the invasive growth of the trophoblast is discussed.","1771":"A ventricular septum defect in a dog has been diagnosed by angiocardiography and color-doppler-echocardiography. The results were compared with those obtained by invasive oxymetry and pressure measurements.","1772":"It is generally known that Homeopathy and other so-called alternative methods of treatment have recently been gaining acceptance. The profession of lay animal practitioner is no longer a rarity in Switzerland. For some, alternative medicine is one phenomenon among others in a saturated health market and thrives on the fact that classical medicine does not yet extend to all areas. For others, the search for alternatives corresponds to a justified demand by the practitioners and denotes an extension of the medical disciplines. The Workshop for Veterinary Acupuncture and Homeopathy (AGVAH) was founded several years ago by veterinarians in Switzerland. It represents the professional interests of its members and upholds their right to practice these forms of therapy. The ensuing debate between classical and alternative medicine questions not only the basis of Homeopathy and similar forms of medicine, but also that of scientific thought. The realization that any scientific approach has its limits can open a door to deeper understanding of traditional occidental medicine.","1773":"This review describes the mechanism of intestinal colonization by enterotoxigenic and enterotoxaemic Escherichia (E.) coli in swine. Colonization depends on specific binding between adhesive fimbriae and receptors on the enterocytes. Special focus is given on the occurrence of specific intestinal receptors for the fimbrial antigens F4 (K88), F5 (K99), F6 (987P) and F41. The demonstration of these receptors allows the identification of susceptible and resistant pigs. Furthermore unclassified adhesive fimbriae of E. coli isolated from pigs with postweaning diarrhea and edema disease are described. Finally the present knowledge is discussed in context with protection of animals against infections.","1774":"This case report describes a three-year-old Swiss Braunvieh cow with ascites due to thrombosis of the caudal vena cava. Ultrasonography verified the ascites and revealed dilatation of the abdominal portion of the caudal vena cava (4.8 cm). It was presumed that the caudal vena cava was occluded by a thrombus or by perivenous compression cranial to the dilatation. Post mortem findings included: a massive accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity; a 15 cm long thrombus in the subphrenic region of the caudal vena cava; multiple pulmonary abscesses; severe thrombosis of the pulmonary vasculature; hepatic congestion; oedematous abomasal folds; and severe thrombophlebitis of the left jugular vein and both udder veins, due to poor intravenous injection technique. Ascites caused by thrombosis of the caudal vena cava is rare because collateral routes of venous return, including the udder veins, are usually established. It was therefore concluded that the ascites was attributable to bilateral thrombosis of the udder veins.","1775":"Milk yield is determined by number, size, synthetic and secretory capacity of mammary alveolar cells and low amounts of residual milk after milking. Initial milk yield and persistency of lactation are important. Important factors to achieve high milk yield are: optimal mammary development and preparation to lactation; maintenance and possibly increase in number and of synthetic capacity of alveolar cells during established lactation; sufficient availability of substrates for milk synthesis through high feed intake, readiness to mobilize body reserves (especially depot fat) and increased mammary blood flow; optimal milk let-down; regular and possibly more than twice milking\/day. Favorable for a high milk yield are high circulating concentrations of somatotropin, possibly associated with increased production and levels of the insulin-like growth factor I, in the presence of low concentrations of and reduced sensitivity or responsiveness of target organs to insulin, reduced circulating levels of thyroid hormones and possibly enhanced conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in the mammary gland. Enhanced sensitivity of depot fat to lipolytic hormones is favorable for high milk production.","1776":"A four year old cow with an enlargement of the uterus of unknown cause was submitted to the clinic. The cow had a pyonecrotizing myometritis and placental retention following an injury of the birth canal. The final diagnosis was only made after pathological examination.","1777":"Dealing with the subject \"polled goats intersexuality\", whose problems are discussed, we studied the pathology of 7 3-month old XX-kids: 2 pseudomales, 3 males with urethral diverticulum (1 animal with 2 U.D.), and 2 testicular pseudohermaphrodites. Four horned male kids of comparable age were used as control. Urethral diverticula, seen now and then in local breeds, i.e. in \"chamois-colored\" mountain goats, Saanen, and Toggenburg goats, are rather unknown and only sporadically reported abroad. In agreement with previous histological studies, the testes were hypoplastic, the spermatogonia absent. In no case ovarian tissue was found. The Leydig cells appeared to be functionally active. The selection of an experimental flock of intersex-free polled goats is proposed.","1778":"","1779":"Applied ethology in general and farm animal ethology in particular have a great importance in connection with animal welfare regulations on a national and international level. They have through the legislation on animal welfare brought about important repercussions on housing of farm animals, wild animals and experimental animals in Switzerland. The animal welfare legislation has been a considerable boost to scientific research. The application of ethological knowledge in the legislation and in practice has indeed also its limits. The importance of applied ethology for animal welfare and for animal husbandry will still increase in future.","1780":"After introducing remarks on the meaning of the ethology of farm animals about the evaluation of housing systems the own examinations about piglets in the rearing period and about housing systems of rabbits held in groups respectively will be demonstrated. By these examinations choice experiments have proved true. For estimating and evaluating the ethological experimental results the concept of the meeting of requirements and avoidance of damage is an important point. The animals requirement can be found out in reference systems. Those investigated results are used as guiding-line for the evaluation of the dates found under practical conditions. The merits of Tschanz concerning the ethology of farm animals will be appreciated.","1781":"Ethological studies in semi-natural enclosures consistently show that the species-specific behaviour of our farm animal species has hardly been changed by domestication. However, in intensive husbandry systems the evolutionary bases of behaviour are neglected. The functions of behaviour are no longer achieved by the animal's species-specific behaviour, but by technical solutions. In contrast, alternative husbandry systems provide the animal an environment that releases and structures its species-specific behaviour. A combined husbandry system for breeding sows and fattening pigs in an enriched pen is described. Although the structures of the pen and the space available differ much from a semi-natural environment, the pigs show their normal species-specific behaviour. This is because the behavioural mechanisms do not respond differently to natural and artificial stimuli in their environment.","1782":"The Swiss Federal Act on Animal Protection (1978) requires the sale of mass-produced housing systems for farm animals to be authorized by the Federal Veterinary Office. Authorization is only granted for housing systems that safeguard the animals' welfare. A concept for the assessment of Animal Welfare has to provide a high forensic value. The capacity of farm animals to adapt to an intensive housing system can be directly examined, whereas the existence and extent of subjective feelings can only be assumed. In our concept the examination focuses on the interaction of individuals with their artificial environment. The main question is whether or not the individuals are able to cope with given nonspecific (e.g. temperature, humidity) and specific (e.g. drinking troughs, behaviour of conspecifics) stimuli in order to reach the immediate (e.g. drinking, make way for) and ultimate (survival, reproduction success) goals. Animals of the same breed are observed in a highly diverse environment in order to determine normal behaviour. Whether behavioural expressions which differ significantly from normal behaviour are adaptive to the restrictive housing conditions is judged by the behaviours' consequences for both, the individuals and the environment. Many studies prove the concept's high forensic value and the authorities prefer conclusions based on this concept to others referring to the animals' motivational and emotional state. However more research has to be done with respect to animal welfare in farm and laboratory animal breeding as well as in the use of laboratory animals for experimental studies.","1783":"Clinical, neurophysiological and histopathological findings of sixteen cases of spinal muscular atrophy in calves are described. The first clinical signs usually were noticed at 2-6 weeks of age. The animals showed weakness in the hindquarters, trembling and ultimate recumbency. There was a marked muscular atrophy in all four extremities. In addition, secondary bronchopneumonia was evident in 11 cases. Histopathological lesions consisted of degenerative changes in the neurons of the ventral horns and the axons of the spinal cord as well as degeneration of nerve axons in the extremities. Neurophysiological measurements revealed spontaneous activity in the muscles of the limbs. The conditions is autosomal recessive. So far 11 bulls have been identified and excluded from breeding.","1784":"Promastigote Leishmania-organisms were diagnostically cultivated in vitro from popliteal lymph node aspirates obtained from 32 of in total 36 dogs returning from endemic areas. Isoenzyme analysis (glucosephosphate-isomerase (GPI), phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and glutamate-oxaloacetate-transaminase (GOT) resulted in the identification of Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania (L.) infantum) for all 18 isolates investigated. Parasites were still able to be cultivated in vitro in 79% of 28 biopsies (from 15 dogs) even following chemotherapy by Glucantime, independent of the time of sampling and the course of disease after treatment. Dogs with a progressive form of disease (despite chemotherapy) showed only a minor or no reduction (between 0 and 4.8%) of the relative antibody concentration (determined by ELISA), whereas regressive forms of disease (without recurrences observed in the period of 10 to 37 months after therapy) demonstrated a marked reduction of the relative antibody concentration (between 6.7 and 16.2%) within the first 5 to 8 months; thereafter the decrease diminished and changed to a persistent low relative antibody concentration.","1785":"","1786":"In this last part the preparation of the patient for the ERG is shown. Anesthesia, positioning, and retrobulbar injection technique are discussed. The protocol for recording the ERG is presented. The dog is dark adapted for 30 minutes. The level of adaptation is examined using a single flash of dim red light at various times. Rods and cones are stimulated separately by scotopically balanced red and blue flashes. After a single flash of bright white light the rods and cones are studied with flicker trains at 5, 12.5, 15 and 30 Hz. During dark adaptation the maximum b-wave amplitude increased from 13.8 +\/- 8.4 microV to 49.3 +\/- 16.3 microV. Bright white light stimuli resulted in b-wave amplitudes of 167.7 +\/- 75.3 microV. There were always 6 oscillatory potentials visible on the b-wave. Scotopically balanced stimuli produced b-waves of 104 microV (red) and 116 microV (blue). It was found that older dogs had reduced b-wave amplitudes and longer peak times than younger dogs. The most common artefacts in electroretinography are discussed.","1787":"This brief review is concerned with the main aspects of our knowledge of a deficiency of the trace element selenium in man and animals. After an introduction about the history of the discovery of selenium as an essential trace element in man and animals a short definition of the term \"essential\" is given. The following chapters are concerned with the etiology of selenium deficiency, the measurement of selenium status and the biological functions of selenium in mammals. Finally selenium deficiency diseases in man and animals will be discussed.","1788":"","1789":"Patent ductus arteriosus, a common congenital cardio-vascular disease, needs surgery for correction. Three methods are described: 1. transsection and suturing of the ductus ends; 2. dissection of the ductus itself and occlusion by double ligation (classical method), 3. modified double ligation described by Jackson and Henderson. A modification of the technique is described, based on the previous methods of double ligation.","1790":"We tested hemolytic E. coli from 86 pigs with edema disease or colidiarrhea. They were tested serologically and with nonradioactive digoxigenin-dUTP labelled probes for the presence of enterotoxin or Shiga-like-toxin genes. By slide-agglutination we detected 38 cases with E. coli O149:K88, 28 with E. coli O139:82B and 20 with E. coli O141. E. coli of serogroup O149:K88 isolated from diarrheic pigs, reacted with the probes for LT and STb genes. Edema disease E. coli O139:82B reacted with the SLTII probe. E. coli O141, isolated from colidiarrhea or edema disease showed a diversity of toxin gene patterns. All the E. coli O141 from diarrheic pigs reacted with the probes for LT and STap in addition to SLTII. No strains isolated from pigs with edema disease possessed any of these enterotoxin genes. Gene probe technique confirmed the serological method as useful tool for diagnosing E. coli O149:K88 and O139:82B as ETEC or VTEC, respectively. On the other hand only the demonstration of toxin genes with probes could explain the pathological findings in the pigs shedding E. coli of serogroup O141.","1791":"The process of behaviour ontogeny occurs epigenetically, i.e. from the interaction at any one time between phenotype, active genes and the environment within the range of the phylogenetically formed \"Reaktionsnorm\". Particularly during the post-embryonic stage, learning processes, such as habituation, classical and operant conditioning, imitation, perceptive learning and imprinting, will influence behaviour ontogeny. In view of the restrictive housing conditions of farm and laboratory animals and of neurophysiological findings it may be postulated etiologically speaking that abnormal behaviour should be attributed to a changed network and differentiation within the brain which may have occurred during early ontogeny (e.g. deprivation and missing or misdirected imprinting). In addition, behaviour disorders may result directly from a dysfunction at the level of information coordination. Animals strive without success to adapt to a rigid, unavoidable and artificial housing environment and as a result develop coping strategies which are maladaptive (e.g. stereotypies, learned helplessness). In order to prevent behaviour disorders, research into their origin is indispensable, as indeed is an examination of the ontogeny of normal behaviour. Only in this way can new housing systems be developed where in spite of restriction crucial stimuli may nevertheless be provided which will enable animals to develop and to breed without suffering harm.","1792":"","1793":"Elbow dysplasia (ED) is a common developmental malformation in many breeds over 20 kg bodyweight. It may affect as many as 50% of all dogs within a breed. Arthrosis and poor performance may result. The most common forms of ED are fragmented medial coronoid process, osteochondrosis of the medial humeral condyle and loose anconeal process. There is evidence for the existence of a hereditary disposition for osteochondrosis in Labrador retrievers. In Sweden selection of ED-free dogs for breeding resulted in reduction of frequency and degree of severity of ED in the offspring. Adoption of a similar breeding program for Switzerland is suggested.","1794":"An outbreak of infectious anaemia in 46 broiler flocks due to chicken anaemia agent (CAA) is described. The vertically acquired infection led to increased mortality (3.6-19.8%) in 16 to 24 day-old broiler chickens. At necropsy severe atrophy of thymus and anaemia with pale bone marrow was observed. The histologic findings were depletion of cortical thymocytes and of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The CAA was isolated from 15 of 35 examined broiler flocks.","1795":"Eighteen healthy foals were studied from birth until 2 months of age. Blood samples were obtained at the following times: presuckle, 30 hours, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks of age. Changes in serum P, Mg, Ca, Na, K, Cl, iron, AP, ASAT, ALAT, GGT, GLDH, CK, lipase, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, protein and fibrinogen and in plasma total solids were examined and the values compared to reference values of adult horses. There were characteristic age related changes in several parameters. Single measurements should be interpreted cautiously to allow for individual variations.","1796":"We present a case of acute lead poisoning in 10 calves. All calves died with few or no clinical signs prior to death. The clinical signs included neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms but were of an unspecific nature. Several painted iron girders, stored on a field close to the farm, were determined as the source of the poisoning. Postmortem findings were minimal. Some animals presented acid-fast, intranuclear inclusion bodies in the renal tubules. A chemical analysis of some frozen parts of the liver and kidney revealed levels of lead as high as 12 ppm in the liver and 63 ppm in the kidney on a wet-weight basis. This article discusses the etiology, clinical signs, postmortem findings and diagnosis of lead poisoning in calves with special emphasis on the chemical analysis.","1797":"The oscillatory potentials (OP) on the b-wave of the canine ERG are characterized. Normal values for an OP-index, implicit times and periodicity are given. The OP-index increases during dark adaptation as well as with increasing stimulus intensities for white light flashes. Scotopic blue and red stimuli, although balanced for the maximum b-wave amplitude, surprisingly result in higher OP-indices for red flashes. Implicit times decrease for all OP with increasing stimulus intensities. Scotopic balanced red light results in OP with markedly reduced implicit times compared to blue light stimulation. The intervals between two OPs remain constant during dark adaptation, however, intervals between OPs with longer implicit times tend to be shorter. In contrast, the b-waves for scotopic balanced stimuli show rhythmic oscillations with constant intervals between them, the intervals being shorter for blue light than for red light. The intervals between OPs tend to become shorter with increasing stimulus intensities. This investigation indicates that OPs are influenced but not generated by photoreceptors. The examination of a dog with optic nerve hypoplasia indicates that the ganglion cells do not contribute to the biogenesis of OPs. The prognostic value of OPs in the early diagnosis for hereditary retinal degenerations in the dog is discussed.","1798":"The thyrotropin response test is the most common test for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Here we report serious adverse effects in two dogs after intravenous administration of bovine TSH. The clinical signs were consistent with an anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reaction. In both cases a previous sensibilization with bovine TSH can be excluded. We discuss the etiology and emphasize the most probable cause to be an anaphylactoid reaction. Preventive measures are discussed.","1799":"In the dog congenital or acquired stenosis of the lumbosacral region is commonly encountered. In humans the lumbosacral junction is the most often affected part of the vertebral column. Lumbosacral instability, one possible etiology for stenosis of the vertebral canal plays an important role in man. This study summarizes the functional anatomy and some important geometric and kinematic considerations necessary for the understanding of the motion (flexion-extension) between two adjacent vertebra.","1800":"In Switzerland during the foaling season 1988 and 1989 the cause of abortion in 60 foals was investigated. Special attention was paid to infections with equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV 1). Diagnosis were based on post-mortem, histopathological, bacteriological and immunofluorescence investigation. The results confirm data from other countries, that EHV 1 is the most prevalent viral (20%) cause of abortion, followed by various bacterial agents (12%). Other causes were umbilical torsion, twin pregnancy and malformations. In 18% of the cases the investigation of fetuses did not give any results as to the cause of abortion, suggesting maternal factors as only cause of abortion.","1801":"A lentivirus belonging to the group of retroviridae causes a chronic progressive interstitial pneumopathy (maedi) or a demyelinating encephalo-myelitis (visna) in sheep and goats. Pulmonary lesions of maedi as well as sero-positive, clinically healthy animals can be observed in Switzerland; visna, which even in countries with endemic infection does not occur frequently, is extremely rare. The head and cervical spine of an ewe with severe nervous troubles suspected of scrapie were submitted for postmortem examination. We found a demyelinating myelitis resembling visna. Immunocytochemical staining (PAP) to demonstrate the presence of the virus in paraffin sections was negative, but several animals of the flock proved to be seropositive for maedi\/visna virus, which supports the histological diagnosis. Although there is no risk of an epidemic outbreak of maedi\/visna in Switzerland, modes of transmission, eradication programmes and prophylactic measures successfully employed in countries with endemic maedi\/visna are discussed.","1802":"The efficacy of the Paratect Flex-Bolus for the control of parasitic gastroenteritis in calves was evaluated in a field experiment in the Swiss midland region. The bolus was administered to 9 first year grazing calves at 4 to 5 months of age before turnout on June 26 while 9 calves remained as untreated controls. Both groups were rotated between 8 paddocks that had been pregrazed by older cattle in spring. For a period of 12 weeks the faecal egg output of the treated calves was reduced significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the controls, whereas no significant differences were observed in the mean serum pepsinogen values of both groups. At the end of the experiment (November 14) the bolus-treated calves showed a 4 kg weight gain advantage over the controls which was not significant. The mild infection levels in both groups were probably due to the low pasture contamination with infective larvae throughout the season which most likely resulted from the late turnout of the calves. An outbreak of dictyocaulosis was observed in both groups in October and confirmed that the Paratect Flex-Bolus provides insufficient protection against this infection.","1803":"This review describes molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular signal transmission. Special focus is given on calcium and calcium binding proteins as signaling intermediates. These strictly controlled biochemical reactions prevent uncoordinated proliferation which may lead to tumor development. Generally, signal transduction pathways are very similar among higher eukaryotes. Mutations in genes responsible for signal transmission and growth control (protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes) are often found in tumors or cancer cell lines.","1804":"The bacterial and fungal flora of 1118 ears of dogs with otitis externa and 100 ears of healthy control dogs were studied in order to isolate the causative agents. The yeast Malassezia pachydermatis (56%) was by far the most common organism in otitic dogs followed by the bacteria Staphylococcus intermedius (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Proteus spp. (6%) and Streptococcus canis (5%). A statistical analysis of observed results showed that the incidence of these organisms is significant in otitic dogs. Many strains of S.intermedius, P.aeruginosa and Proteus spp. are resistant to antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat otitis externa. Therefore an antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using \"Cobas Bact\" for these bacterias. Furthermore, 80 strains of M.pachydermatis were submitted to identification-kits (API 20 CAUX, API STAPH, Cobas Micro). The observed results showed that an identification with these tests was not possible.","1805":"A case of E. canis in a 7 year old intact female bearded collie is described and possible clinical signs of Ehrlichiosis are discussed. Non-specific findings included elevated rectal temperature, depression and anorexia. Additional findings were generalized lymphadenomegaly, myalgia and painful swollen joints. Significant changes in the CBC were leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. The positive E. canis titer of 1:40 and rising titer to 1:160 were specific for Ehrlichiosis. Doxycycline and prednisolone were needed to obtain clinical remission, which underlines, that immune-mediated processes are important in the pathogenesis of Ehrlichiosis.","1806":"The frequency of fish diseases diagnosed at the Fish Disease Laboratory at the University of Berne from 1979 to 1988 is presented. Parasitic infections have been found to be the most frequent diagnosis. Among noninfectious diseases poisonings were predominant. Six infectious diseases have been considered to be economically relevant. These diseases (according to their frequency: Gyrodactylosis, Costiosis, Ichthyophthiriosis, Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS), Saprolegniosis and Furunculosis) were further analysed. Their incidence varies with season, species, origin and length of fish. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.","1807":"In a controlled study, the distribution and elimination kinetics of hydroxyethyl starch as well as clinically relevant parameters were determined in horses. The half-life of the first phase was 5.59 hours, that of the second phase 122.22 hours. During the first phase, hydroxyethyl starch persisted almost exclusively intravascularly. The results of this study are largely in agreement with those in human beings. Thus, routes of elimination, duration of plasma-expanding action, distribution volume and redistribution kinetics in horses and human beings are very similar. However, the elimination kinetics of the second phase and the behavior of serum amylase appear to be equine-specific. Coagulation is barley influenced by the administration of hydroxyethyl starch. The results of this study confirm that hydroxyethyl starch is very suitable for use as a plasma-expander in horses.","1808":"Between 1988 and 1990 we have investigated 45 cases of the rabbit viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) at our institute in order to ascertain: 1) both monthly and regional distribution of the disease: 2) the histopathological patterns of the disease. The VHD cases were particularly frequent between October and January and between May and August. They occurred in 7 cantons. The panlobular hepatocytic necrosis was observed in 80% of the cases, whereas in the remaining 20% the necrosis occurred in the periportal region. In 80% of the animals the spleen blood vessels were dilated with perivascular fibrin accumulation indicative of hyperpermeability. In two cases haemoglobin cages were observed in the kidney tubules.","1809":"Equine bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected from 70 horses and respiratory secretions (RS) obtained from 61 of these horses were evaluated cytologically and grouped according to the histological diagnosis of the lungs from which they were obtained. The histological categories included: normal lung (8 horses); pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration (9 horses); interstitial pneumonia (5 horses); pulmonary hemorrhage (5 horses); and mild (12 horses), moderate (7 horses) and severe (24 horses) chronic small airway disease. In horses with pulmonary disease, all BAL samples and all but one RS sample differed cytologically to those obtained from normal horses; however, the type and severity of the pulmonary disease could not always be determined using either BAL or RS cytology. There was a positive association between the percentage of neutrophils in BAL and the neutrophil scores in RS specimens; there was no positive association between other cell types.","1810":"A special form of keratitis in the cat is described on the basis of 8 clinical cases. The disease has been known in the United States and the United Kingdom for some time, however, it has, to our knowledge, never been described in Switzerland. This keratitis is characterized by chronicity and infiltration of the cornea by mast cells and eosinophils. It is usually an unilateral and painless condition. We describe the clinical features and diagnostic examinations of the disease. Cytology of a corneal scraping is usually diagnostic. As in the cases described in the literature the cats were successfully treated with oral megestrol acetate. The aetiology of the disease is unknown.","1811":"Most organs, unless mineralized or gas containing, may be examined ultrasonographically, though with variable success. Echocardiography is a particularly valuable tool since the dynamic cardiac action can be quantified in detail. In parenchymal organs discrimination between solid and cavitary lesions such as cyst, hematoma, or abscess is possible. Focal disease is more easily recognized than diffuse disease. Establishment of an etiologic diagnosis is rarely possible. Many organs however may be biopsied under ultrasonographic guidance and control.","1812":"Two small free range flocks with 32 hens, whose Salmonella enteritidis contaminated eggs caused salmonellosis in man, were investigated for localisation of the agent. Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 was isolated from 12 of 32 hens (37.5%). Eight hens (25%) harbored the bacterium in the ovary and\/or the oviduct. The rapid slide agglutination test with Salmonella pullorum-antigen revealed 21 positive hens (66%). All eight hens with Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 in the reproductive tract were seropositive. The significance of these findings for the control of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4-infections in poultry is discussed.","1813":"The somatic cell count (SCC) was determined in 28 milk sheep with normal udder health using the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and a fluoro-opto-electronic cell counter (Partec Counter). The examinations were made at two week intervals throughout the lactation period. 92% of the premilking samples had a negative CMT reaction and in 0.5% of the samples the reaction was distinctly positive. In 95% of the premilking samples the SCC showed less than 200,000\/ml and in 95% of the individual total milkings it was less than 350,000\/ml. Elevated SCC were common towards the end of lactation when milk yield was low.","1814":"Comparative behavioural observations were made in the home setting in order to analyze the ethology of the human-cat relationship. Factors postulated, and indeed, found to influence that relationship included marital status of the human (women living alone, with a partner or with a partner and children), housing conditions of the cat (indoor vs. outdoor access), number of cats kept (one vs. more than one), and to a very minor extent, pedigree of the cat (purebred vs. domestic mixture). Various measures of success at both the interactional, and the relationship level were examined and yielded the following results: 1) The more successful the person is in initiating interactions with the cat, the shorter, the total interaction time with the pet. 2) The higher the proportion of all successful intents to interact that were due to the cat, the more time spent interacting. 3) Willingness to comply with the partner's wishes to interact is positively correlated between the cat and the human over all pairs examined--which helps explain the widespread popularity of cats, as pets.","1815":"Spongiform encephalopathies occur in humans and several domestic animal species. Among them, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has aroused considerable interest because of a massive outbreak of this disease in Great Britain, which is thought to result from feeding meat and bone meal contaminated with the spongiform encephalopathy agent. We observed the first case of BSE in Switzerland, which is also the first case on the European continent. A 6 year old cow suffered from progressive neurological disease. On neuropathological examination typical spongiform changes and neuronal vacuolation were found. The origin of the infection remains unknown. It cannot be excluded that the animal was exposed to cattle feed derived from Great Britain. It is possible that additional sporadic cases may occur in Switzerland, an outbreak such as in England is unlikely to happen.","1816":"","1817":"DNA diagnostic has become very important for genetic and infectious diseases. With a new method, called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), specific pieces of genomes from viruses, bacteria, parasites or even cells can be amplified more than hundred million fold in a very short time period. For the following reasons this opens a new dimension in diagnostics: (1) The technique is so sensitive that a single virus, bacterium, parasite or cell is sufficient to be detected provided part of its nucleic acid sequence is known. (2) The material does neither need to be fresh nor be stored under special conditions since the nucleic acids are much more stable than e.g. enzymes or other proteins. (3) The method is quicker than the usual immunodetection methods. (4) The polymerase chain reaction has been standardized recently so that it can be carried out in diagnostic laboratories. The purpose of this minireview is to give an introduction into the basic technique and to mention possible and already existing applications in veterinary medicine.","1818":"","1819":"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a vaccine strain of Newcastle disease as antigen has been developed. It allows the control of the drop in the maternal antibody level of 1 and 28 days old chicks. Thus it can be used as alternative to the inhibition of hemagglutination method. A comparative study has shown a good correlation between the enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay and the inhibition of hemagglutination.","1820":"An infestation with Raillietia auris in a 4 years old cow is reported. For a period of 3 weeks the animal showed an increasing unrest, extreme efforts while trying to feed, and continuous shaking of the head which slanted to the left. After slaughter numerous specimens of the ear-mite R. auris were found in the basic part of the left auditory canal, located in the vicinity of a purulent paste-like plug. Histological examinations of the brain revealed a severe non-purulent meningoencephalitis with necroses of the vascular walls, focal malacia and gliosis. An etiological correlation of these lesions with the mite-infestation, however, is considered to be most unlikely. To the best of our knowledge the occurrence of R. auris in Switzerland was up to now unknown.","1821":"The results of continually repeated transrectal palpations, performed in 168 post partum periods, 383 estrous cycles and 178 early pregnancies, were used to describe and to discuss the left-right distribution of ovarian functional structures. In cycling as well as in pregnant cattle, anovulatory interestral follicles and estrous follicles or corpora lutea in the mean were all distributed at 41% and 59% on the left and right ovaries respectively. No signs were found indicating that the position of functional structures would be influenced by local interactions between follicles and corpora lutea. At least for cyclic ovarian activity, and in early pregnancy, the interrelationship observed between the locations of these structures could be put down to the normally increased activity of the right ovary. After delivery, the first follicles preferentially became discernible on the ovary opposite to the previously pregnant uterine horn. But, as from the 4th follicle p.p. onward, the distribution of new ovarian structures again agreed with the one of the ensuing reproductive stages. After calving, probably the position of new follicles is temporally influenced by direct signals from the uterine horns affected differently by pregnancy. Several observations indicate that the factors causing asymmetrical ovarian activity could exert a selective effect on the recruitment of the dominant and solitary interestral follicles from the pool of their minor and less differentiated precursors.","1822":"Eighty-one cows with ovarian cysts were treated with one group receiving 1500 IU HCG\/150 mg progesterone and the other group receiving 5000 IU HCG\/300 mg progesterone. A second examination was performed two weeks later. Milk progesterone levels were determined both initially and at the follow-up examination. No significant relationships were observed between firmness of the wall of the cysts as well as other clinical signs and the progesterone values. The examination two weeks later revealed similar findings for both treatments with a great variability within the groups. Normal ovarian activity was observed in slightly more than half of the animals. The discussion of the findings also considers the high tendency of ovarian cysts for spontaneous regression.","1823":"Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies are a group of chronic, always fatal diseases affecting the central nervous system of humans and animals. They occur in all species and are probably caused by agents called prions. In this minireview, a first part provides an overview of the various disease forms, a second part is devoted to the molecular biology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and a last part deals with the specific problems of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.","1824":"Veterinary assistants being members of the Swiss Veterinary Association received a questionnaire in 1989. Informations concerning the search for employment, employment conditions, introduction into the job, working climate, field of activities, postgraduate education, professional aims and prospects for the future as well as the particular situation of women were collected. 2\/3 of the assistants in practice and 4\/5 of Faculty assistants found their jobs privately without any public advertisement. 3\/5 of the assistants in a practice have been employed without a written contract. The mean working time without emergency calls and night work amounts to 45 hours a week in small animal practice and 50 hours in large animal practice. Salaries have been shown to be clearly higher in practice compared to universities. Postgraduate education, however, has obviously been missing in over 50% of assistants in practice but not at the Faculty. Most assistants in practice as well as at the universities strive for partnership practice, especially for both, small and large animals.","1825":"The dosage of Prostaglandin F2 alpha used until the present (100, 250 and 1000 micrograms\/kg bw), in order to treat pyometra in the bitch, was accompanied with side effects such as salivation, vomiting and diarrhea. In the present work, the efficiency of low dose Prostaglandin (20 micrograms\/kg bw) was examined in two different groups of patients: Group 1: Included 9 bitches pregnant for a period of 5-7 weeks duration. Initially the bitches were treated 3 or 4 times per day with Prostaglandin F2 alpha. In these cases abortion took place within 4 to 11 days. Group 2: 12 dogs, suffering from pyometra, were treated 3 times per day with PGF2 alpha for 8 days. In 9 dogs the pyometra resolved and the bitches came in estrus 2-5 months after treatment. 7 bitches have been mated and 6 of these gave birth to healthy litters. During a follow-up period of at least 10 months there has not been a reoccurrence of pyometra. In 3 out of the 12 dogs the uteri were still enlarged after 8 days of treatment. These bitches underwent ovariohysterectomy and a cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium was diagnosed histologically. The low dose (20 micrograms\/kg BW) Prostaglandin F2 alpha induced in all dogs the expulsion of the uterine contents. Side effects during the treatment were not observed.","1826":"","1827":"In human cancer treatment, CEA (carcino embryonic antigen) testing is a routine procedure, even though the test is of low sensitivity (40%) and low specificity (70%). Since tests with polyclonal antibodies render no reproducible results with animal sera, the applicability of a recently available monoclonal CEA test designed for human sera was evaluated. We were able to show that the latter test was of supplemental diagnostic value when testing animal sera. The upper normal limit for dogs is 1.65 ng\/ml, for cats 2.81 ng\/ml, for cows 2.85 ng\/ml, for sheep 2.85 ng\/ml and for horses 1.61 ng\/ml.","1828":"The second part of this study deals primarily with the technical aspects of electroretinography. A custom made dark chamber for the patient is presented. The requirements for an optical stimulator are discussed in detail and the recording instrumentation--electrodes, amplifiers, averager, digitalizer--are presented. The display of the signals on a monitor and plotter concludes this technical description. The remainder of part 2 is devoted to the many factors influencing the recording of an ERG, notably pupillary diameter, anesthesia, oxygen and glucose supply to the animal, body temperature of the patient, its intraocular pressure and level of retinal adaptation, and finally the age of the patient. On the technical side the intensity, wavelength and frequency of stimulation play an important role.","1829":"In a herd of 23 ewes of the White Alp breed, a congenital epitheliogenesis imperfecta was observed in five twin-births. All lambs originated from the same father. Except in one case, only one of the twins was affected. Characteristic lesions were epidermal defects between the coronary groove and the carpal\/tarsal joint, exungulation, and defects in the buccal mucosa (cheeks, palatum durum, tongue). After removal of the ram from breeding, no more abnormalities were observed.","1830":"","1831":"The morphological features and fluctuation of cellular components derived from haemograms of a cat infected with toxoplasmosis provide information on the state and activity of important cell systems: the unspecific cellular defense by means of phagocytosis as well as the recruitment and functional stimulation of phagocytizing cells by cytokines and moreover the specific immune reaction, triggered by macrophages, phagocytizing, processing and presenting antigens to immune competent T-cells, inducing an immune response, which finally leads to the formation of antibody-producing plasma cells from B-cells.","1832":"In the last years molecular biology has gained more and more influence in veterinary medicine, e.g. in animal breeding. In addition, methods of molecular biology may open new areas in the diagnosis of viral diseases, because they are fast and very sensitive. The following article displays an overview of molecular biological techniques that are currently in use for virus detection. In addition, the limits of these methods are discussed. In particular, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is described in some detail. Since this method has a considerable impact on the progress in molecular biology, it may as well be of importance for the detection of viruses. The potential of PCR in virus detection is illustrated using sheep and goat lentivirus and Bovine Viral Diarrhea\/Mucosal Disease virus.","1833":"","1834":"7 chamois-coloured mountain goats were used to investigate histologically and histochemically the processes of involution and redevelopment of the mammary gland after a lactation period of 8 to 10 months. Tissue specimens were obtained by incision biopsy at drying-off two months prepartum and afterwards in intervals of 8-16 days up to parturition. The findings of this investigation were compared with results of two former investigations, in which involution and proliferation of the gland were studied separately, thus precluding an overlapping of the two processes. At drying-off, after an 8 to 10 month-lactation, sections indicative of active lactation occurred concomitantly with sections at various stages of involution, as well as early stages of redeveloping alveoli. At 16 days post drying-off, the sections indicating lactation at first examination were in a stage of maximum involution and transformation. Thus, the time required for involution was reduced by half compared to drying-off at peak lactation. At 32 days post drying-off, stages of proliferation predominated with only a few involuting glands. Specimens obtained thereafter contained only redeveloping glands. The histological and histochemical differentiation between areas of involution and those of proliferation may present difficulties during the mid-portion of the dry period. There appears to be an association between the length of the time interval from drying-off to parturition and the rate of tissue transformation in the caprine mammary gland; the rate is increased when the duration of the dry period is reduced.","1835":"In the first of three parts of this investigation the clinical importance and the principal indications for electroretinography are presented. The histology and ultrastructure of the retina with special emphasis on the photoreceptors and the second order neurons are discussed. A section is devoted to the history of electroretinography in man and animals. The components of the ERG and their origin are discussed.","1836":"In landlocked countries, the role of fish is often poorly known and\/or propagated. In many countries fish represent the biggest and qualitatively most valuable protein source (24% of the worldwide available animal protein) for human consumption. At present the economic significance of the production and trade of fish is already very high. However, according to FAO, the future demand of proteins can only be covered by a considerable expansion of the aquaculture production, in particular because of a stagnated fish catch and a continuous reduction of the agricultural production. The ideational value of ornamental fish appears obvious however pet fish keeping represents also a value worth of many millions US dollars worldwide. Finally the importance of fish will not only increase for economic, but certainly also for ecological reasons, because it is well established as an incorruptible bioindicator of our environment.","1837":"In two fattening trials, each time 64 male calves of Simmental x Red Holstein cross breeds were used to investigate the influence of different commercial feed additives containing at the same time antimicrobial agents, minerals and vitamins on growth performance, feed intake, feed conversion and health condition. Calves whose milk diets were supplemented had, depending on products used, higher growth rates (9 to 28%) and better feed conversion rates (2 to 12%) compared to control calves which were fed only whole milk. This improved performance is primarily due to higher feed intakes. It is questionable how much the minerals and vitamins in addition to antimicrobial agents contributed to the improvement. The additional mineral supply caused after 8 weeks a statistically significant higher haemoglobin content, serum magnesium and glutathione peroxidase activity in erythrocytes compared to the exclusive whole milk feeding. Calves which were fed no additives refused feed intake more often as a result of disease incidence and required veterinary treatment more frequently.","1838":"The effect of selenium status on the development of Heinz body anaemia was studied in 16 three months old Saanen goats which received a diet with a low selenium content. The control group (Se-, n = 8) received no supplementary selenium while the treated group (Se+, n = 8) received selenium by injection. Erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase concentration was significantly higher in the Se+ group than in the control group (105 vs 36 U\/g Hgb). The animals were drenched once per day with 30 mg of dimethyl disulphide (DMDS) per kg of body weight for 14 days and with 50 mg per kg during the following 11 days. Erythrocytes with Heinz bodies appeared within one week after increasing the DMDS dose to 50 mg\/kg\/day and reached a peak one week later (30% and 37% of erythrocytes with Heinz bodies in group Se+ and Se- respectively). Within the next three weeks haemoglobin levels dropped from 135 g\/l to 123 g\/l and 114 g\/l in the Se+ and the Se- group respectively. Differences between the two groups were statistically significant for the percentage of erythrocytes with Heinz bodies and for haemoglobin values (p less than 0.05). The data support the hypothesis that selenium status influences the resistance of ruminants to brassica-induced Heinz body anaemia.","1839":"","1840":null,"1841":"In this review, the main aspects of our knowledge of the physiology and pathophysiology of the beta-amino sulfonic acid taurine will be summarized. After shortly considering the chemistry, the occurrence and the metabolism of taurine, the biological functions of taurine in the mammalian organism will be dealt with. With respect to taurine deficiency, this review will be limited to the cat since taurine is an essential nutrient for this species.","1842":"The entire diagnostic material of the Fish Disease Laboratory at the University of Berne from 1979 to 1988, a total of more than 3800 cases, is presented. Not included is material of import controls and material from experimental work. The following criteria were evaluated: fish species, origin and length of fish, season, infectious and noninfectious diseases. Furthermore, the results were investigated for changes of the composition of fish species and number of diseases within the ten-year period and for a seasonal influence on the outbreak of diseases. More than 40% of all fish investigated were rainbow trout, followed by brown trout, omamental fish and cyprinids. Over 40% of fish originated from private fishfarms whereas 20% were of governmental origin (governmental fishfarms, rivers, lakes) and 20% from aquaria. Parasites were present in more than 40% of all cases. Bacterial infections were diagnosed in nearly 30%, viral infections in 6% and fungal diseases in 5% of all cases. 20% of all cases concerning noninfectious diseases were caused by unfavourable environmental conditions whereas the incidence of diseases related to nutrition was less than 10%. The occurrence of the different diseases was waxing and waning over the period of ten years but no definite tendencies could be emphasized. However, most of the diseases investigated demonstrated a significant seasonal influence.","1843":"Defence reactions of cattle against Fasciola hepatica take place not only in the liver but also on a prehepatic level. The aim of the present experiments is to identify and quantify the cellular response in the small intestine. Five groups of two bulls (Simmental x Red Holstein, 6 months old) were infected by oesophageal probe with metacercariae of F. hepatica (MC) according to two experimental procedures. Two groups of bulls served as controls. In the first experiment both infected groups received 1000 MC once or twice at an interval of five weeks. The intestinal tissue was taken before infection and 5, 10 and 19 weeks p.i., respectively 5 and 14 weeks p. reinf. (p.ri.). In the second experiment, three infected groups received 400, 2 x 400 MC (at an interval of five weeks) and 800 MC respectively. Biopsies were taken one week ante infectionem, 6, 11 and 19 weeks p.i., respectively 1, 6 and 14 weeks post reinfectionem (p. ri.). The biopsies of the small intestine were prepared for histology and the tissue sections stained as follows: Astra blue for mucosal mast cells (MMC), Lendrum for eosinophils (EOS) and Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) for goblet cells (GC). The density of the three cell populations in the mucosa was determined microscopically and quantified. In both experiments the density of the MMC and EOS increased with each reinfection and depended on the infectious dose. There was no significant variation of the GC-numbers. The described intestinal cellular reactions suggest a participation of the small intestinal wall in the immunity against the common liver fluke.","1844":"The infection of our indigenous wild birds by the parasite Collyriclum faba represents a rare event. The adult trematodes reside in the subcutaneous tissue of the host, where prominent cysts can be found. In summer 1988, two cases were diagnosed, in a house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and in a goldcrest (Regulus regulus), which led us to a description of this unusual parasitic disease, whose cycle still remains unknown, and to a review of the prior known appearances in Switzerland. In the time between 1960 and 1989, a total of 2070 wild birds were examined in our Institute. In only four cases could an infection with C. faba be demonstrated. All of the affected birds belonged to the order of the Passeriformes. The occurrence rate of infestation among all wild birds was of 0.2%, and of 0.6% within the order of the Passeriformes. On the basis of this infection rate in our samples, we conclude that the rate of C. faba infections in wild birds of Switzerland is extremely low.","1845":"Between March 1988 and December 1989, 198 gastrointestinal tracts from slaughtered horses from different areas of Switzerland have been analysed for the presence and the frequency of Gasterophilus spp. During the same period--always between July and November--200 horses from selected areas of Western Switzerland have been checked for the presence of eggs and their subsequent developmental stages in order to investigate further clinical and biological aspects of this infection. The evaluation has been performed according to origin, age, sex, colour of the horse and seasonal pattern of the cases and the various larval stages, respectively. The prevalence of Gasterophilus spp. amounts to 64.6%, showing a marked seasonal distribution. Only Gasterophilus intestinalis has been detected and the Western part of Switzerland appears to be considerably more contaminated than the other areas of the country. The reasons are discussed. It is possible that an intensive horse-traffic at the border is partly responsible. Horses with a dark coat are more often parasitized whereas no difference occurs with regard to age and sex. The observed high prevalence of this parasite infection in the Swiss horse population confirms that gasterophilosis has to be taken into serious consideration and prophylactic measures might be indicated.","1846":"Biotin deficiency in animals causes pathological changes of the skin and its appendages including, for example, exfoliative dermatitis, depigmentation, and alopecia. The hooves of biotin-deficient swine are weak, brittle, and often necrotic. These changes disappear after dietary biotin supplementation. Biotin supplementation also noticeably improves the hoof quality of horses, cattle and swine having no apparent biotin deficiency. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the influence of biotin on cytokeratin expression in a keratinocyte cell line (Ha-CaT) was investigated using electrophoretic and immunological techniques. Pharmacological biotin concentrations of 1 microM, and 100 microM in the culture medium caused a specific increase in cytokeratins, which are normally induced upon terminal differentiation of epidermal cells in vivo. The expression of cytokeratins occurring in stratified epithelia independent of differentiation were not affected. These findings show that biotin directly stimulates the differentiation of epidermal cells. Such a molecular mechanism revealed in cell culture could provide an explanation for the therapeutic effects of pharmacological doses of biotin on hoof quality in farm animals.","1847":"Two useful staining methods for the diagnosis of haemobartonellosis on blood smears and distribution of Haemobartonellae on erythrocyte surfaces are shown.","1848":"With the development of recombinant DNA-technology during the last 15 years, it became possible to analyse genetic variability directly at the level of genomic DNA. Restriction-Fragment-Length-Polymorphism (RFLP) and Highly-Variable-Regions (HVRs) lead to the development of new genetic markers, which can be used for the localization of normal and mutated genes. Some polymorphisms are hypervariable and can therefore be applied to carry out DNA-fingerprints thus identifying individuals from man and animals.","1849":"","1850":"1215 strains of bacteria isolated from cows suffering from acute or chronic clinic mastitis were tested in the antibiogram according to the Kirby-Bauer method. The germ spectrum included: 304 DNase-positive strains of Staphylococci 304 DNase-negative strains of Staphylococci 304 CAMP-negative strains of Streptococci 303 Strains of Enterobacteriaceae The antibiotics selected were Penicillin, Cloxacillin, Neomycin und Gentamicin, then the combinations Penicillin\/Neomycin, Cloxacillin\/Gentamicin and Nafcillin\/Penicillin\/Dihydrostreptomycin. Gentamicin showed excellent action against Staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae. Further on, the present investigations show, that the combination Cloxacillin\/Gentamicin is fully effective in the gram-positive spectrum (against Streptococci and Staphylococci), as in the gram-negative spectrum (against E. coli).","1851":"During three years (1982 to 1984) data were collected concerning diseases and reasons for culling in 612 dairy farms with Brown Swiss, Simmental and Black and White cattle. The frequency of culling increases in all three breeds with increasing age, from 20% at the first lactation up to 33% from the 4th lactation on. The main reasons for disposal are insufficient production, reproductive problems or udder diseases. After treatment for reproductive problems, mastitis or acetonemia, the risk for culling within the same lactation period is increased. Reproductive problems (no heat symptoms, repeat breeder, ovarian cysts) and acetonemia increase with increasing milk production in all three breeds. In cows with high 100-day-performance they are also more frequent. The occurrence of acute mastitis shows no general trend with increasing milk production or with high 100-day-performance. No systematic relationship is found between reproductive disorders or acute mastitis and persistency of milk production. On the other hand, acetonemia is somewhat more frequent in cows showing higher persistency.","1852":"The QBC V hematology system was tested with respect to its application in veterinary medicine. PCV's and counts of total leukocytes, granulocytes, lympho\/monocytes and platelets collected from 435 horses, dogs and cats were determined and compared with conventionally measured values. Precision and accuracy were found to be good for the majority of parameters. In the authors' opinion the QBC V hematology system is well suited for use in veterinary practice.","1853":"Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diagnosed in a 3 1\/2 year old cow of the Simmental breed. The cow was little less than 6 months pregnant and was admitted to the clinic because of severely disturbed general health. The most important clinical findings were increased heart and breathing rate, rectal temperature of 39.9 degrees C, nosebleed and petechiae on the nasal mucosa. Additionally, the cow showed petechiae on the vaginal mucosa, haemorrhage from the rectum lasting several hours after rectal examination and severe haemoglobinuria. Haematological and biochemical examinations showed increased liver enzymes and severe changes in all coagulation parameters (platelet count, PT, PTT, thrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products). Based on the mentioned findings the diagnosis DIC was made. Possible causes were severe necrotic endometritis and placentitis combined with fetal death. High counts of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens were determined in liver, lung and abomasal contents of the aborted fetus as well as in the placenta. Uterine secretion contained Actinomyces pyogenes besides.","1854":"18 piglets were fed either a dry, humid or soup diet and each animal was dosed with 40 mg chlortetracycline\/kg bodyweight. The chlortetracycline-concentration in the diet was 2500 mg\/kg air-dried feed. After a single oral dosage the absorption of chlortetracycline occurred significantly faster from the soup diet, resulting in higher serum levels as well as prolonged elevated serum concentrations of CTC compared with the other two diets. Using a mathematical model, serum concentrations over a 5-day period with repeated dosage of CTC were calculated. Based on this dates we recommend the following dosage regime for chlortetracycline: 20-30 mg CTC\/kg bodyweight\/12 h for soup feeding and 30-40 mg CTC\/kg bodyweight\/12 h for dry or humid feeding.","1855":"The authors describe two cases of myocardial infarction evaluated during an anatomo-histopathological study on the cat's cardiovascular system. The authors discuss the pathogenetic hypotheses and their role in comparative pathological studies.","1856":"Ponies were fed hay (n = 21) or mixed feed (n = 27; 128 g crude protein, 175 g crude fibre\/kg dry matter) for at least 14 days (treatment against parasites with ivermectin before the experimental period). The feeding level was 18 g dry mater\/kg body weight\/day. After the feeding period (the experiments were conducted to investigate the water and electrolyte content of the alimentary tract in dependence on feed, feeding time and physical exercise) the ponies were slaughtered and the stomachs were visually controlled for the occurrence of ulcers. In the hay group no gastric ulcers were observed, but from the 27 ponies given mixed feed 10 (chi 2 = 7.71) animals showed ulcers on the cutaneous mucosa of the pars oesophagea localized along the margo plicatus. At 3.5 hours postprandial the percentage of dry matter in gastric contents of concentrate fed ponies was higher than in those which consumed hay; 12 hours after feeding the opposite took place. The gastric fill was rather similar, while the amount of chlorine and the pH-value respectively were 37 (+\/- 16) mg\/kg BW and 3.83 (+\/- 0.83; n = 8) respectively in hay fed animals compared to 45 (+\/- 17) mg\/kg BW and 4.84 (+\/- 0.55; n = 11) respectively in ponies, which consumed the mixed feed.","1857":"Pathological findings from 389 SimmentalxRed Holstein cattle and from 11 Holstein\/Friesian cattle with cardiomyopathy (CMP) are described. The average age of affected animals was 34 months; the majority of cases was observed between October and March. The hallmark of the disease was cardiomegaly with ventricular and atrial dilation and hypertrophy, as well as myocardial fibrosis, in part accompanied by myofibrillar degeneration. Striking vascular changes within lung vessels were hypertrophy of arteriolar and venular walls together with luminal stenosis of veins. Marked hepatomegaly was induced by chronic liver congestion with hepatocyte degeneration and fibrosis. Many cases showed chronic, interstitial nephritis. CMP affected crossbred cattle only, which suggests a genetic factor influencing the pathogenesis of this disease by possibly interfering with biochemical and metabolic pathways leading to endothelial damage and extracellular matrix alterations.","1858":null,"1859":"In the present study spontaneous uterine motility was recorded in 4 cows during late pregnancy, parturition and the puerperium using pressure microsensors and electrodes which were surgically implanted into the myometrium of the pregnant horn 3 to 4 weeks before parturition. Hysterograms were evaluated by means of pressure amplitude, frequency, duration, interval of uterine contractions and also by electromyography. During the last 2-3 weeks of pregnancy only single weak uterine contractions of different intensity were seen. About 18-20 hours a.p. frequency and amplitude of mainly tubocervical directed waves continuously increased. When the fetus entered the birth canal and especially during expulsion of the calf extremely strong irregular contractions occurred, which became very regular during the first hours p. p. After the placenta has been released 3-8 hours p. p., spontaneous uterine motility drastically decreased until the second postpartal week, when it started to increase again.","1860":"By symphysiotomy and inserting of a homograft, the pelvic transverse diameter of a cat, suffering from pelvic fracture complication, has been improved. Chronic obstipation has been suppressed; gait and muscular atrophy have been ameliorated.","1861":"HAES Steril 10% is a colloidal plasma expander rarely used in veterinary medicine. In this study HAES was used in clinical cases for the treatment of shock and in a comparative hypervolemic hemodilution study (HAES versus lactated Ringer's solution) using two experimental horses. Injection of a HAES volume equivalent to 10% of estimated blood volume resulted in a highly significant drop in PCV and in a significant drop in total protein concentration. Half live of HAES was approximately two hours. No incompatibility reactions were observed. In man HAES improves microcirculation. Studies in progress may confirm a similar effect in the equine.","1862":"Post-mortem examinations were carried out on 168 kittens 0 to 12 weeks of age. One third of the kittens died of an infectious agent, one third showed non infectious illnesses and in one third the examinations revealed none or vague results.","1863":"Squamous cell carcinoma in the axilla, unilaterally as well as bilaterally, is described pathologically in three love-birds and two budgerigars. The deep, hemorrhagic ulceration with secondary bacterial and\/or mycotic infection corresponds to the \"EMA-Syndrome\".","1864":"Vasculature of the epididymis was investigated by means of corrosion casts. In the boar, epididymal arteries form a complex network around their stem vessel, the testicular artery. Proper perfusion fixation or complete casting therefore require direct injection into one of these branches. To reach the distal cauda, cannulation of the deferential artery is further needed. Connections between all of these feeding vessels occur at the level of the vascular cone. A prominent anastomosis between an epididymal branch and the testicular artery is regularly observed under the caput epididymis. Epididymal veins drain to a large extent into the pampiniform plexus. Unlike the situation in other species, vascularization of testis and epididymis are closely associated in the boar.","1865":"Twelve sows each farrowed in an experimental pen designed especially for this study or in a crate. Viable counts of enterobacteriaceae were performed in samples taken from the laying area and from the teats. Secretion from every mammary complex was examined repeatedly for bacteria and for somatic cells. The sows in the experimental pen did not lay down in their own faeces. The viable counts in samples from the laying area and the teats were much lower than with the sows kept in farrowing crates. Infection with E. coli was observed in 3 mammary complexes of the sows in the experimental pen as compared to 27 complexes of the sows in the crate. More than half of the infections was detected in the samples taken before farrowing began. In the average the bacteria persisted for 1.3 days. On the first 4 days of life piglets sucking teats with cytologically defined mastitis had an average daily gain of 105 g as compared to 125 g with piglets sucking healthy teats. In conclusion puerperal mastitis is a consequence of faecal contamination of the mammary gland. Soiling of the laying area with faeces and urine can be reduced by improvements in the farrowing accommodations.","1866":"","1867":"The uterine effects of oxytocin, the prostaglandins dinoprost and cloprostenol as well as clenbuterol, ergometrin, xylazine and Utrorale were investigated in 8 cows during late pregnancy, parturition and early puerperium (until 4th day p. p.). Uterine motility was measured by means of pressure microsensors and electrodes which were surgically implanted 3 to 4 weeks before parturition. Hysterograms were characterized by means of pressure amplitude, frequency and duration of uterine contractions and also by electromyography. Oxytocin (2-5 IE) given intravenously always provoked strong uterine contractions until the 4th day p.p. From the prostaglandins examined during early puerperium only dinoprost (15 mg i.v.) produced uterotonic effects, while the synthetic analogue cloprostenol (0.25 mg i.v.) had a weak stimulatory activity only on day 1 p.p. Both prostaglandins were ineffective when injected intramuscularly. Clenbuterol (0.3 mg i.v.) a beta 2-mimetic compound effectively induced long lasting tocolysis during parturition, which could be abolished by oxytocin. Xylazine (10 mg i.v.) was able to significantly increase uterine motility during late gestation. Following intravenous administration of ergometrin (1 and 10 mg), bunitrolol (1-16 mg) and Utrorale (0.1-4 ml) including its compounds oleum sabinae, oleum terebinthinae, balsamum copaivale and Styrax no uterokinetic activity was recorded at any time.","1868":"Thirty-nine horses and 3 ponies underwent a thorough respiratory examination and were grouped as follows: healthy (4 horses and 1 pony); mild chronic pulmonary disease (CPD 11 horses); moderate CPD (16 horses and 1 pony); and severe CPD (8 horses and 1 pony). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected from all animals and respiratory secretions (RS) obtained from 39 of these animals were evaluated cytologically and the results were compared. It was concluded that cytological examination of either BAL fluid or RS was useful in diagnosing various equine pulmonary diseases. The only advantage that BAL offered over RS sampling was in cases in which there was no RS available in the trachea. In addition, the severity of the CPD did not always correlate with either RS or BAL cytology.","1869":"Carprofen, flunixin meglumine and placebo in the form of a physiological solution of sodium chloride were tested in an open randomised cross-over trial for analgesic efficacy in horses with two external skin-stimulation systems. Both systems, the withers model and the \"heating element\" model, were compared in order to find an optimal way to measure pain perception after stimulating the skin with high temperature. No analgesic effect of flunixin or carprofen could be demonstrated when using the withers model. In the \"heating element\" model, a 1.1 mg\/kg i.v. dose of flunixin meglumine failed to inhibit the peripheral pain, while it could be shown that a 0.7 mg\/kg i.v. dose of carprofen inhibited the peripheral perception of pain in horses for approximately 24 hours after the drug injection. To induce an analgesic effect with carprofen, its plasma concentration had to be at least 1.5 micrograms\/ml.","1870":"The effect of noradrenaline and adrenaline on isolated smooth muscle from the reticular groove of calves was studied. Both catecholamines caused a concentration-dependent (1.1.10(-6) mol\/l) contraction of the transversal muscle strips from the floor of the reticular groove. This excitatory effect was antagonized by prazosin (10(-7)) mol\/l), and by high concentrations of yohimbine (10(-6) mol\/l) and atropine (10(-5)) mol\/l). Tetrodotoxin (3.10(-6) mol\/l), an inhibitor of nerve conduction, did not change the contraction induced by catecholamines (55.10(-6)) mol\/l). Catecholamines did not produce a contraction of the longitudinal muscle from the lips of the reticular groove. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (55.10(-6) mol\/l) even elicited a reduction of acetylcholine (55.10(-6)) mol\/l) induced contraction of both the transversal and the longitudinal muscle from the reticular groove. The relaxing effect of isoprenaline was antagonized by propranolol (55.10(-6)) mol\/l). According to these results the excitatory effect of catecholamines on the smooth muscle cells occurs through alpha-adrenergic receptors, whereas the relaxing effect is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors of the muscle cell. The excitatory effect of catecholamines on the transversal muscle appears to be predominant. Atropine appears to be an unspecific blocking agent of alpha-adrenergic receptors.","1871":"","1872":"A liver infection with Capillaria hepatica is described, having been found for the first time in Switzerland in a dog and a hedgehog. After a literature review of cases known among man and animals, we present our own pathological findings. Furthermore, the parasite's life cycle is discussed.","1873":"32 young and healthy cows each received a single intrauterine treatment with one of the following solutions: Lugol's solution, Vetedine, Lorasol, Lotagen, Aureomycin, and normal saline solution as a control. Endometrial biopsies were taken immediately before application and at days 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20 and 30 thereafter. On day 1, degenerative and inflammatory reactions could already be observed in all groups, with the exception of the control group. The intensity of the lesions varied, not only between treatment groups but also to a lesser extent between individuals within groups. Degeneration and inflammatory reaction found in the subepithelial stromal tissues were more distinct than those seen in the epithelia. Lorasol caused the most severe degenerative changes, regarding the depth of degeneration into the tissue, as well as the intensity of the inflammatory reaction. Lugol's solution also showed a high degree of change, followed by Lotagen and Vetedine showing moderate change, respectively. Reaction to the antibiotic treatment with Aureomycin was only slight. The regeneration time of these lesions was proportional to the intensity of the induced changes, amounting to 10-15 days for Lorasol and 3-6 days for Aureomycin, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed.","1874":"Lately reports of nocardial mastitis have been increasing. Therefore the clinical aspects of 7 individual cases were investigated. Pathologic-anatomical changes of the udder were registered and bacteriological examination of tissue and milk probes were performed. All of the cows had a mastitis during previous lactation periods which had to be treated with antibiotics. The infected quarters recovered in no cases. Shortly after parturition 6 cows had a severe acute mastitis. The cows were treated intramammarily and parenterally with various antibiotics during several days. The infected quarter became indurated and strongly enlarged. These changes were not influenced by therapy, and the cows lost weight. 14 days after the outbreak of the illness, all 6 cows were culled. One cow had a chronic Nocardia mastitis with involution of the affected quarter. Though treated several times, this cow did not recover either. The histopathological examination of the affected quarters revealed an acute to chronic, necrotic to granulomatous mastitis. Nocardia asteroides was histologically and bacteriologically proven to be the causative agent. The reason for the frequent infections with Nocardia and the way of infection is not clear yet. Therapy with antibiotics brought no recovery in any cases. The infected cows should be removed from the herd or culled.","1875":"Polyclonal antibodies can be isolated not only from the blood of immunized mammals but also from the egg yolk of immunized chickens. The advantages of this alternative method are: 1) Birds produce antibodies against highly conserved mammalian proteins. 2) The quantity of antigen needed for an efficient immune response is very low (20-30 micrograms). 3) The use of complete Freund's adjuvant leads to long lasting titers of yolk antibodies yielding a total amount of 65 mg specific antibodies per month. 4) The purification of antibodies is simple, inexpensive and quick. Polyethylene glycol precipitation is sufficient to obtain a purity of more than 90%. 5) Chicken antibodies are acid- and heat-resistant and might therefore be orally applied to prevent or to cure infectious intestinal diseases of young animals or humans. 6) Immunization with complete Freund's adjuvant is well tolerated and produces no inflammatory reactions and 7) collecting eggs is, in contrast to bleeding animals, non-invasive. In this review we present both, the method how to produce and to isolate yolk antibodies as well as their possible application in science, diagnosis, prophylaxis and therapy.","1876":"Ultrasonography utilizes high frequency sound waves between 2 and 10 MHz. Returning echos from reflecting surfaces in the body are displayed as two-dimensional images on a CRT screen. Ultrasonography is particularly useful for analysis of internal structures of parenchymal organs such as liver, spleen, kidneys, prostate and uterus, as well as fluid filled organs such as heart, urinary bladder, gallbladder, and pregnant uterus. The clinical examination is safe. Sector transducers with frequencies between 5 and 10 MHz are useful for dogs and cats.","1877":"We present a literature review on current techniques of intravenous regional anesthesia and intravenous regional antibiosis of the distal limb in cattle. Our own experiences performing a combined procedure of intravenous anesthesia and antibiosis (10 million I.U. benzylpenicillin sodium dissolved in 15-20 ml 2%-lidocaine hydrochloride) are discussed in detail. Complete anesthesia of the treated limb was achieved in 22 out of 23 cases (96%). The successfully treated animals did not express any symptoms of pain for the entire surgical procedure. In 2 out of 15 patients (13%) we observed serious post-surgical complications. The reason of which was extensive thrombosis of all veins distal of the tourniquet. The age of the clots at the time of slaughtering of the cows was determined histologically. A direct cause effect relationship between intravenous anesthesia\/antibiosis and complication is indicated. We conclude that direct toxicity of the 2000-fold overdose of benzylpenicillin (as compared to generally accepted therapeutic levels) most likely caused the problem. We recommend to reduce the dose of penicillin in regional intravenous antibiosis to maximally 100,000 I.U., even in the case of local sepsis.","1878":"The objective of the present review was to summarize current knowledge of African horse sickness (AHS), based on available literature (which is nonetheless relatively scant) and recent information obtained from the O.I.E. Brief description is made of the biology of AHS virus (an arbovirus, transmitted by Culicoides imicola), isolation of the agent, diagnosis by serotyping procedures, and preventive measures (such as protection of horses from insect infestation, or vaccination programs) which may be taken. The recent outbreaks in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, have demonstrated that much more research on this disease is required.","1879":"Clinical findings, therapy, and prognosis of 20 calves with urachal problems were studied and are discussed. Ultrasonography proved to be a valuable adjunct diagnostic procedure to manual palpation. It allowed exact evaluation of the intraabdominal umbilical cord size and was an important aid in the selection of the correct therapy. A complete omphalourachectomy was performed in calves with an extra- and intraabdominal umbilical cord diameter of up to 10 cm, otherwise drainage was established. Based on our results prognosis for calves with urachitis is independent of the size of the umbilicus and can be judged as favourable in cases without systemic complications.","1880":"It is generally accepted that both, the wildebeest-derived malignant catarrhal fever (WD-MCF), and the circumstantially evidenced sheep-associated form of the disease (SA-MCF), may be explained as autoimmune disease of various ruminants, namely cattle and farmed deer. The disease follows infection with related herpesviruses being shed by the respective healthy carrier animals. This has convincingly be shown to apply for WD-MCF (Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1, AlcHV1). SA-MCF, however, remains to be controversial with both respects. In Switzerland, a serological study indicated that a herpesvirus(es) was highly prevalent among cattle and sheep, inducing antibody that cross-react with AlcHV1 and bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV4). The latter is known as a largely innocuous agent. A relationship can be demonstrated between the presence of MCF in this country and concurrent serological reactions to both viruses. However similar results may be obtained with healthy animals. Healthy cattle and sheep from farms with or without incidences of MCF displayed the same antibody profiles. It is thus not possible to effectuate meaningful diagnostic tests for (SA-)MCF, nor to confirm any relationship between presumed carrier sheep and the appearance of MCF.","1881":"The so-called \"fox tapeworm\" (Echinococcus multilocularis), the causative agent of a severe disease in man (alveolar echinococcosis), is presently under public discussion in Switzerland. Therefore, actual information is provided on the life cycle of the parasite, epidemiology, disease in humans, symptomatology, diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis. It is recommended that in endemic regions hunters handling foxes should wear protective gloves, dead foxes should be transported in plastic bags and wild fruits, berries and vegetables should be carefully washed and--if possible--heated to more than 70 degrees C for some minutes prior to consumption. After contact with foxes or other final hosts (dogs, cats) infected with E. multilocularis, persons should be monitored with the highly sensitive and specific Em2-ELISA for serum antibodies aiming at an early diagnosis and treatment of a potential infection.","1882":"The judgement of the quality of pig meat is often based on prize and muscle cross sections as well as the amount of meat in the carcass. Accordingly the physiological, sensory and technological properties are not considered sufficiently. Even in small quantities the regular ingestion of pig meat contributes markedly to cover the nutrient needs of the Swiss population (mainly amino acids, magnesium, iron, zinc and the vitamins B1, B2, B12 and niacin). Furthermore pig meat contains hardly important amounts of undesired constituents, which might harm the health of the population. Important drawbacks are a to low fat content in the muscles and in the adipose tissues, the fat consistency and oxidative stability. With suitable measures in breeding and feeding of the pigs an improvement of the situation can be achieved already after a short period.","1883":"An outbreak of abortion due to the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in the eastern part of Switzerland is reviewed. Seven of eleven pregnant mares aborted within twenty-three days in January 1989. Four weeks later another foal died a few minutes after parturition. Three mares delivered live foals in February, March and April without any complications. The examination of the eight dead foals revealed an EHV-1 Infection. The clinical signs and the pathology are discussed. Severe complications during the early post-parturient time are in contrast to the uncomplicated outcome mentioned by other authors. Procedures for prevention and control are listed.","1884":"Swiss Animal Protection Regulations summon that the food provided shall be such as to permit the animals to satisfy their need for occupation combined with feeding. In intensive cage-keeping of fattening rabbits there is often no hay or straw fed in addition to the pellets, despite ethological evidence, that this does not fit their need for occupation. In a large semi-natural enclosure (600 m2) with grass and shrubs as well as feeding huts with pellets young rabbits at the age of 30-120 days are observed seven times from 6.00-21.00 h (N = 78 observations on 13 individuals). During this time they spend 81 +\/- 37 minutes feeding on pellets and 92 +\/- 47 minutes grazing, mainly early in the morning or late in the evening. In a group housing system for fattening rabbits (base 150 x 150 cm, two floors) the behaviour of 24 young rabbits from six different groups is surveyed in the region of the hay rack with a video camera. Two recordings during 24 hours in each group at the age of about 60 days (N = 48) show that in addition to feeding on pellets the animals engage with hay and straw for 111 +\/- 45 minutes a day. The daily distribution shows maxima at dawn and dusk. The feeding patterns correspond to those observed in the semi-natural enclosure. Based on the ethological evidence and the Animal Protection Ordinance rabbits are to get additional straw or hay.","1885":null,"1886":"Serum samples from 1421 domestic cats (561 healthy, 860 sick) were tested for FIV-, FeLV- and coronavirus infection. The results were stored in a computer data base and compared with epidemiologic data and clinical findings. All 3 infections were significantly more prevalent in sick than healthy cats: FIV was found in 0.7% of healthy and 3.4% of sick cats. For FeLV the prevalence was 3.0% and 13.0% and for coronavirus 21% and 36.2%, respectively. FIV-infected cats were mostly male (73%); no sex predilection was observed in FeLV- and coronavirus infection. In sick cats FIV-infection was significantly more prevalent in cats greater than 2 years of age; no age-dependence was found in FeLV- and coronavirus infections. The prevalence of FIV-infection increased significantly with the number of animals per household. In contrast, the frequency of FeLV infection decreased with the number of animals per household. Prevalence of coronavirus infection did not vary with group size or living conditions. The following clinical symptoms were associated with infection: FIV: general depression, diseases of the urinary tract; FeLV: general depression, fever, rough hair coat, lymphadenopathy, impaired functions of heart and circulation and muscle atrophy; coronavirus: lymphadenopathy and alterations in the abdomen. It was concluded that based on the clinical symptoms alone FIV-infection could not be diagnosed nor differentiated from the other 2 infections.","1887":"Based on an epidemic in Switzerland, the histopathological findings of a viremic Herpes infection in Spur-tailed and Spur-thighed mediterranean land tortoises are described for the first time. Horizontal viral transmission has been proved; the vertical transmission is suggested. An impression smear of the tongue enables an early clinical diagnosis.","1888":"The authors describe the possibility of adopting a DNA probe in the detection of Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV), using the molecular hybridization technique. The study was carried out on 18 seropositive Friesian cows taken from different stock farms during the persistent lymphocytosis phase. The presence of a possible BLV molecular variant was highlighted in one stock farm.","1889":"Thirty young white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and black storks (Ciconia nigra) from a stork restocking station in Switzerland suffered from cutaneous, verrucous pox-efflorescences on legs, feet, beak and eyelids. The poxvirus was demonstrated ultrastructurally. As the endemic was in autumn, mosquitos may be a possible vector. It is uncertain, if the disease is connected with the previously imported storks from the Federal Republic of Germany.","1890":"For the first time a detection about bovine enzootic leukemia in the Swiss canton Neuenburg was carried out. Out of 3674 milk samples only two gave seropositive results. The advantage of the immuno-enzyme method ELISA is obviously: reliable, cheap and easy to apply.","1891":"25 horses which entered the clinic for minor surgery, received ketamine (2.2 mg\/kg i.v.) for induction of anesthesia after previous sedation with xylazine (1.1 mg\/kg i.v.). As soon as the horses were in the lateral recumbency, the benzodiazepine derivate climazolam was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg\/kg i.v. (10 horses) or 0.2 mg\/kg i.v. (15 horses). The anesthesia was maintained with repeated injections of ketamine (1.1 mg\/kg i.v. every 9-12 minutes). At the end of the surgery, 20 minutes after the last ketamine injection, Ro 15-3505, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was injected at a dose of 0.01 mg\/kg i.v. or 0.02 mg\/kg i.v. Climazolam successfully suppressed the adverse reactions of ketamine, such as poor muscle relaxation, hyperacusis and convulsions. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-3505 allowed good control of the duration of anesthesia and--in most cases--a smooth, predictable recovery period was the result.","1892":"Carprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was injected intravenously in six cows after calving, either as a single or a daily dose of 0.7 mg\/kg for five days. Carprofen was well tolerated by the cows at this dose rate, the milk production and biochemical variables remaining within the normal ranges. The plasma elimination half-life of carprofen ranged from 44.5 to 64.6 h after repeated daily injections. These values are longer than those reported for other NSAIDs used in veterinary medicine, e.g. flunixin and phenylbutazone. The volume of distribution and the clearance values calculated after a single intravenous injection amounted to 0.09 l\/kg and 9.0 ml\/min. The concentration of carprofen in milk collected twice daily (morning and evening) was, in general, below the sensitivity limit of the analytical method (25 ng\/ml) up to five days after the last carprofen injection; the concentration of carprofen reached about 30 ng\/ml in only a few milk samples collected after the fourth or fifth injection. This indicates that carprofen is poorly excreted in the milk.","1893":"Twenty-six cases of mandibular fractures and luxations are reviewed. Mandibular trauma was due to car accidents (46%) and falls from great heights (23%). Cardiovascular shocks (40%), thoracic injuries (23%), epistaxis (30%), cleft palates (19%), subconjunctival hemorrhages (15%), broken canines (15%), concussions (15%), maxillary fractures (12%) were the most frequently encountered associated problems. Of the 26 cats, 22 had symphyseal fractures, 6 mandibular body fractures, 4 ramus fractures (3 of which were articular) and 6 had temporo-mandibular luxations. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed in 21 cases, surgery being indicated for unstable symphyseal and body fractures, the rostral body fractures being the most challenging to repair. Conservative therapy and ancillary treatment methods such as external coaptation and pharyngostomy were used for the fractures of the ramus. Six temporo-mandibular luxations associated with mandibular fractures in 5 cases were reduced under anesthesia. Good dental occlusion and mandibular function was obtained in the 24 treated cases.","1894":"Based on clinical, macroscopic and light microscopical examinations we describe for the first time in Switzerland the \"infectious necrotizing hepatitis\" of rabbits (Marcato et al., 1988).","1895":"The technical and biological progress together with improved educational programs for farmers have strongly influenced the development of Swiss agriculture after World War II. In spite of a decreasing number of farms and employees agricultural production has clearly increased resulting in some market problems as well as in a higher impact on the environment. Therefore, the goal of agricultural politics is to unify the sometimes divergent interests by means of offer regulation, income guarantee and environmental protection. In order to successfully meet the requirements of the 21st century, Swiss agriculture needs responsible and dynamic farmers.","1896":"","1897":"The assertion that animals have interests and rights comparable to those of humans raises some new questions: How should unavoidable conflicts between man and animal be solved? How should a decision be taken in a conflict between human demands of no vital necessity e.g. the consumption of meat or mobility, and the right of animals to live? The answers to these questions illustrate the scope and limitations of ethical discussions. In spite of this solutions have to be elaborated based on conscience, ideas of a fair partnership and theological considerations.","1898":"","1899":"Results of inquiry made of 2190 dog owners about customs of feeding and keeping dogs in Switzerland are presented. The diet most often used consists of cereal flakes which are given together with feedstuff from animals or other commercial dogfood. Usually, only one meal per day is given and the amount of food is based on a constant body weight. Regular feeding of bones appears to have a good effect on digestion and dental health.","1900":"10 cows suffering from bacteriological proved A. pyogenes-endometritis have been treated by a single intrauterine infusion of GENTASEPTIN. All animals were cured. Clinical findings were confirmed by bacteriological tests. All animals conceived at the first insemination after treatment. The intrauterine application of GENTASEPTIN seems to be a very efficient treatment of A. pyogenes-endometritis as compared to hitherto existing treatments.","1901":"Solitary injuries of the gall bladder and the bile ducts are very seldom and dangerous. The prognosis of such injuries depends of the delay until the diagnosis is made and of the method of the bile ducts reconstruction. Several methods have been described; we present a method of reconstruction of the bile ducts after cholecystectomy with a bilio-digestive anastomosis with following advantages: no tension on the anastomosis, possibility of several anastomoses on the same jejunal loop, exact adaptation of the mucosa and elimination of the reflux of intestinal contain in the bile ducts with a long and isoperistaltic Roux-loop.","1902":"The Domestic Dog lives today in the industrial nations mainly as a companion animal of man and is not so much used or exploited anymore, as in earlier times or in other cultures. There exist the following forms of keeping (\"keeping systems\"): Keeping in apartments or houses, keeping in enclosures or pens, keeping the dog attached or chained, letting the dog roam freely and uncontrolled. The latter form will not be discussed. For the keeping of dogs in enclosures or chained, forms which are easier to detect, observe and control, there exist rather well-defined criteria for an evaluation of the keeping conditions, to a great extent based on the animal welfare legislation. Dogs in apartments or houses however are kept in the seclusion and privacy of human homes which makes an evaluation of the keeping conditions more difficult. Basically however, the same criteria are to be applied as to the other keeping forms. Keeping of dogs in apartments or houses is to be considered as appropriate for the animal, if certain requirements are met. Dog keeping includes being busy with the animal in different ways. Animal appropriate ways of treatment of and of occupation with the dog are therefore an integrative part of correct keeping conditions.","1903":"A severe neurological disorder was observed during a very dry season, in sheep pasturing on land with mediterranean vegetation. During the crisis, lasting 5-20\", ataxia and convulsions were the main clinical signs. Brain congestion, spongy appearance of the liver, interstitial nephritis and hyperpigmentation of visceral lymph nodes were the most important macroscopic lesions. Histopathological, histochemical and ultrastructural findings confirmed liver and kidney lesions and showed considerable neurovisceral storage of lipofuscin. Although further toxicological and experimental studies are needed to elucidate the origin of the disease, the Authors attribute the outbreak of the neurological syndrome to the ingestion of a neurotoxin containing plant.","1904":"The motor cortex was transcranially and peripheral nervous structures (motor roots, plexus, peripheral nerves) were percutaneously stimulated by magnetic pulses in awake dogs and in dogs awaking from general anesthesia. The compound muscle action potentials were recorded by surface or needle electrodes. The central motor conduction time as an information about central motor tracts was obtained by subtracting the peripheral latency from the corticomuscular latency. The peripheral latency was assessed by high voltage electrical and magnetic stimulation of motor roots and by the F-wave technique. The motor conduction velocity of the tibial nerve was measured by percutaneous magnetic and by electrical stimulation and the resulting values were compared.","1905":"188 bovines with neurological disease were analysed in a retrospective study. We found that only few diseases can be diagnosed on the basis of neurologic signs only. However, with a few additional clinical data such as signalment, history, extraneural findings, hematological findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, a diagnosis can be made in many cases. A history of neurologic signs occurring since birth, is highly suggestive of a congenital malformation. High fever and mucosal changes are typical for malignant catarrhal fever. Lesions of peripheral nerves and spinal cord compression can be diagnosed based on the neurologic signs. Cranial nerve dysfunction and central vestibular signs in combination with other findings as age, season and cerebrospinal fluid, are indicative of listeriosis. Tetanus is characterized by pronounced extensor rigidity. Systemic muscle diseases were also included, because motor neurons and muscle cells are a functional unit. A suspicion of white muscle disease can be confirmed by increased creatine phosphokinase activity in serum. Suppurative bacterial meningoencephalitis can be diagnosed by the presence of a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. The clinical differentiation between sporadic non suppurative meningoencephalitis and metabolic diseases of the central nervous system remains difficult.","1906":"For various anamnestic reasons the cervical vertebral column of 78 horses was examined radiologically. Statistical comparisons showed that male \"warmbloods\" were more frequently affected than was expected. Our horses were older than comparable animals in the international literature. Independently of their history the radiologic diagnosis of \"cervical spondylarthrosis\" was established in 56 horses. Arthrosis and other conditions were clinically manifested by spinal ataxia (44 horses) or mechanical impairment of the neck's mobility (21 horses). 10 of the arthrotic patients had synovial cysts causing compression of the spinal cord. 79 percent of all dorsal intervertebral arthrotic joints were found in the caudal column (C6\/7 to C7\/Th1). With 38 percent, C6\/7 was the most frequently affected joint. Clinical and radiological findings could be compared with patho-anatomic results in 29 horses. The correlation was satisfactory.","1907":"In order to investigate usefulness of electrodiagnostic methods in Cauda Equina-Compression, 26 dogs with this disease were subjected to electromyography and spinal evoked potentials. 16 normal dogs served as controls. It was found that--after stimulation of the Nn.tibialis, peronaeus, pudendus and coccygeales and recording at the lumbosacral junction--latencies and nerve-conduction velocities were largely normal. However the amplitudes were decreased and--depending on the severity of the compression--the morphology of the potentials was altered although considerable standard deviations were obtained. Electromyographically, increased spontaneous activity with fibrillations and positive sharp waves were found in the myotomes of the lumbosacral nerves. Their number increased according to the severity of the cauda equina compression and they had a centrifugal distribution pattern. Based on these results it appears indicated to perform an electromyographic exam before applying myelography. The technique of spinal evoked potentials will need more refinement and standardisation before being useful in a clinical situation.","1908":"The Authors describe chronic vaginitis of bovines in intensive breeding. All of the 78 subjects examined presented vaginitis, accompanied by fibrinous hydrocele. On the spermatic cord and the tail of epididymis, initial lesions consisted of granulomas and fibrinous bridges between vaginalis propria of testicle and of epididymis. Subsequently appeared adherence and synechiae, which join the deferens and epididymis body to didymis, and thickening of albuginea. Synechiae can develop between peritesticular vaginalis propria and communis. Histopathological findings: peritoneal-like papillary structures with metaplastic mesothelial cells; diffuse lympho-plasmacellular infiltration with eosinophils and mast cells; intense capillary angiogenesis. The epididymal lesions are: diffuse mononuclear infiltration; periarteritis nodosa; papillary proliferations of endothelium; endothelial degeneration; tubular ectasia and stenosis; intraepithelial cyst. Noticeable within testis: periarteritis nodosa; fibrosis of albuginea; spermatocytes vacuolisation; multinucleate spermatids; epithelial shedding. The Authors pointed out: the serological and bacteriological testings furnished inconclusive results; only pathological finding always present is a large infestation of cremasteric muscle with Sarcocystis, to which is attributed the etiopathogenesis of flogosis, that is chronic from the beginning. The Authors propose the terminology of \"Chronic peritesticular and periepididymal vaginitis\" or \"Chronic Periorchitis and periepididymitis\".","1909":"","1910":"A follow up study was performed in 412 spayed bitches in order to determine the incidence of urinary incontinence. The period between the operation being performed and the survey being made varied between 3 and 10 years. 83 animals (20.1%) were incontinent independent of the surgical procedure (ovariectomy versus ovariohysterectomy). The onset of incontinence varied between immediately to 12 years with an average period of 2.9 years after surgery. 57 of these incontinent bitches were treated with ephedrine or estrogen. In 73.7% a good response was achieved with ephedrine and a further 23.7% showed some improvement. Generally ephedrine was more successful than estrogen in the treatment of incontinence. There appears to be a strong connection between body weight and the incidence of incontinence. Of bitches with a body weight of less than 20 kg only 9.3% were incontinent. Whereas in bitches with a body weight of more than 20 kg the incidence was 30.9%. Of the breeds Boxers showed a high incidence of incontinence (65%) while breeds such as German Shepherds (10.6%) or Dachshunds (11.1%) showed a low incidence in relation to the average incidence rate (20.1%).","1911":"In various districts (Cantons) of Switzerland 815 calves (a few days up to 6 months old), 382 lambs and 20 young goats (both groups 1-6 months old) were selected randomly for a single coprological examination (flotation method) for Giardia infection. In average 26.6% of the calves, 29.8% of the lambs and 4 of 20 young goats excreted Giardia cysts. In 9 Cantons the percentages of cyst excretors among the calves varied between 15 and 32, but these differences were not significant. Further there were no significant differences in the frequency of cyst excretion between calves of 3 different breeds and 2 age groups (up to 3 months old and 3 to 6 months). The intensity of cyst excretion was high and varied in random samples between 4.1 x 10(3) and 3.0 x 10(5) cysts per g of faeces in calves and between 2.2 x 10(3) and 1.6 x 10(5) in lambs. In 5 of 7 farms where calves and lambs were maintained simultaneously both animal species were Giardia infected. As expected, trophozoites of Giardia isolates from calves and lambs belonged to the Giardia duodenalis type and could not be differentiated on a morphological basis. Giardia cysts from calves (average measurements: 13.7 x 9.1 microns) and lambs (13.8 x 9.2 microns) were indistinguishable both morphologically and morphometrically. The results indicate that Giardia infections are frequent and geographically widely distributed in calves and lambs in Switzerland.","1912":"A case of aortic valve dysplasia in a 6 year old male cocker spaniel is described. The dog was presented to the veterinarian because of strong dyspnea and frequent coughing. Clinical examination, EKG, radiographs and angiocardiography all pointed towards a tentative diagnosis of aortic insufficiency. Four months after the first appointment the dog was presented again with congestive heart failure, neural symptoms and strong abdominal pain. Electrocardiography and concentrations of LDH and CK were typical of myocardial infarction. Autopsy revealed a narrowing of the aortic valves in combination with a subaortic stenosis and several infarctions localized in the left ventricle as well as a recent infarction in the left kidney.","1913":"","1914":"Carprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, was given intravenously in five cows at a daily dose of 0.7 mg\/kg for five days beginning on day 1 postpartum. Blood samples were collected at various times over a period of six days following the first injection. At this dose, carprofen reached highest plasma values of about 45 micrograms\/ml after the fifth injection and was well tolerated by all the cows. During the whole experimental period, mean plasma levels of 15-keto-13, 14-dihydro-prostaglandin F2 alpha, the primary metabolite of PGF2 alpha, were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in treated than in control animals (28-47% vs 64-101% of pretreatment concentrations). The suppressive effect of carprofen on PGF2 alpha-production occurred immediately after its application and was maximal 3-6 h post injection on the first and on the fifth experimental day (60-80% and 40-85%, respectively). We conclude from our results that carprofen in a single dose of 0.7 mg\/kg b.w. effectively suppresses PGF2 alpha-release in the postpartum cow. Whether this effect is beneficial in the treatment of uterine inflammatory processes remains to be determined.","1915":"Using a partial sanitation method \"Enzootic Pneumonia\" (EP) could be eradicated in 17 EP-reinfected pig breeding herds. Partial sanitation includes separation measures in form of a piglet and gilt free interval on one side and as an additional protection against reinfection the temporary feeding of a medicated diet on the other side. Frequent herd controls for several years as well as mixed fattening experiments with carcass examination combined with milk and blood serology served as criteria for the sanitation success. From these results it is concluded that the infection pathway of EP is mainly maintained by young animals in the herd. Contrary to total sanitation, which will amount to at least sFr. 720 per sow, partial sanitation will only cost between sFr. 40-170 per sow, depending on herd size. Therefore, partial sanitation may be regarded as a full alternative to total sanitation after an outbreak of EP.","1916":"Normal radiographs of hocks were analyzed for 270 horses (3 views for each hock). They were mainly from young and sound horses. For such animals, the mean number of abnormalities found was 2 to 4.5 for each picture. The mean dimension of certain tarsal bones was measured; geldings had greater bones than mares. An increase of reactions at the origin of the M. interosseus was seen with the age. It was possible to demonstrate that Medichrome films increase the number of discrete abnormalities to be found; this is of particular value for purchase examinations of young horses. The direction of the central beam (angle) is important in order to get symmetrical pictures; a minimal change in this angle can show or hide discrete abnormalities. A description of the normal radiographic anatomy of the equine hock, and its principal variations, is given.","1917":"A retrospective study of 24 cases of inflammation of carpal extensors (m. extensor carpi radialis, m. extensor digitorum communis, m. abductor digiti I longus) was conducted. The findings of anamnestic, clinical, and post-mortem investigations are described. Half of the patients were first calf heifers at the ages of 2 1\/2 to 3 years. The rest of the animals were older cows (with one exception). In all of the young cows the disease had become apparent within 11 weeks post partum. The most striking clinical finding is the posture of the animals when lying down: the affected forelimbs are extended forward. Palpation reveals a homogeneous firm swelling of the cranial portion of the forearm. Most of the patients also had pododermatitis in hind and\/or front legs, and exhibited signs of a systemic reaction in the form of \"polysynovitis\" and raised serum total protein concentrations. Post mortem examination revealed a hemorrhagic edematous impregnation of the distal part of the radial carpal extensor muscle and particularly of its fascia. The tendon and tendon sheath had unclear contours and were swollen. Histologically the lesions are typical of subacute granulating inflammation. As to the cause, it is assumed that the ailment is a significant complication of some other disease of the locomotion system. Type and localization of the lesions suggest a traumatic etiology. Therapeutic results have been unsatisfactory.","1918":"The efficacy of a recently developed Morantel-Sustained-Release-Trilaminate-Bolus (Paratect Flex Bolus [PFB]-Pfizer Inc.) against gastrointestinal nematode infections in cattle was assessed by monitoring faecal egg counts (EpG), herbage larval counts, serum pepsinogen levels and liveweight gains in first season calves. In two field trials (1987 and 1988), a PFB-Bolus was administered to two different groups of animals (1987: 15 calves; 1988:13 calves) at turnout (29 May 1987; 26 May 1988), control groups were included. In 1988, 13 calves received for comparison an Oxfendazole-Release-Bolus (Systamex Intervall Bolus [OXF]-Coopers Inc.). All groups were grazed on adjacent but separately fenced pastures throughout the season, until housing (27 October 1987; 15 October 1988). When compared with controls, the PFB-groups showed significantly lower EpG values and consequently, lower herbage larval counts throughout the season in both trials. From day 30 after turnout, the PFB-group had significantly lower serum pepsinogen levels, which reflects the low degree of abomasal damage in these animals. When compared to controls, the PFB-treated animals showed significantly higher weight performances. The mean weight-gain benefit of PFB-treated animals was +12.5 kg (p less than 0.05) and +21.1 kg (p less than 0.005) in 1987 and 1988, resp. No difference occurred between PFB-treated and OXF-treated calves, the latter outperformed the control animals by +21.6 kg (p less than 0.005).","1919":"As far as the authors know this is the first case of Key-Gaskell-syndrome being described in Switzerland. The clinical signs of megaoesophagus, anorexia, constipation, dryness of all mucous membranes, reduced tear production, protrusion of the membrana nictitans, mydriasis, regurgitation and bradycardia are pathognomonic and can't be mistaken by any other disease. The subject of the Key-Gaskell-syndrome is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Histopathological changes are exclusively related to the autonomic nervous system and to neurons of some nuclei in the cranial nerves. Less severe changes can be found in the neurons of the spinal cord or in the dorsal root ganglia. The etiology remains still unclear. There is a relationship to the grass sickness syndrome in horses and to dysautonomia of man and dog.","1920":"The first case of Key-Gaskell syndrome in Switzerland has been described. The disease is mainly characterized by damaged autonomous ganglia. Lesions of the parasympathicus account for dry mucous membranes, mydriasis, paralysis of the bladder, megaesophagus and paralysis of the remaining gastrointestinal tract. Lesions of the sympathicus are explained by bradycardia and prolapse of the third eyelid. Until now the etiology of the disease is not known.","1921":"Structure and function of Peyer's patches in man and animals are compared reviewing reports of recent years. Differences exist regarding number and distribution of Peyer's patches along the small intestine and regarding distribution of m-cells of dome epithelium. M-cells trigger the contact between infectious organisms and intestinal epithelium. Several different ways of interaction are possible: 1. Selective uptake of organisms by m-cells. 2. Paracellular transport of organisms between m-cells. 3. Multiplication of organisms above dome epithelial areas. 4. Restriction of interaction between organism and mucosa to absorptive enterocytes. 5. Specific damage of organisms to lymphatic areas of Peyer's patches.","1922":"Taste has a dual role. Like other senses it informs the individual about the external world, but unlike other senses it connects that perception with information about the internal environment. The principal function of taste is similar in all higher species. Molecules act on specialized sensory cells (= taste cells) in various regions of the oral cavity thus triggering signals, which are relayed to the cortex via afferent nerves, the caudal hindbrain and the thalamus. Taste afferents also reach the hypothalamus and the limbic system. The taste of food triggers physiological and behavioral reactions in man and animals. Stimulation of taste cells immediately elicits salivation, secretion of gastric acid and pancreatic juice as well as secretion of gastrointestinal and pancreatic hormones. Innate and learned taste preferences or aversions play an important role in food selection and taste aversions are considered to be reliable indicators of malaise. Neural signals from the periphery or humoral factors which are sensed by receptors in the central nervous system both can change the acceptance of a certain taste. Endogenous opiates in the brain seem to play a special role in the modulation of taste perception. The amygdala is apparently a brain area which is particularly important for taste perception.","1923":"The radiological findings regarding eggs (variation in form, size, shell thickness, degree of calcification) combined with the clinical symptoms (Ca-Gluconate and Oxytocin application as well as unsuccessful labour contractions and constipation) set up the diagnosis of dystocia in the tortoise. Celiotomy is the remedy for cesarean section, ovariosalpingotomy and gastrointestinal foreign body. A large, topographically well-placed Plastron incision, separation and reposition of the m. pectoralis and m. obliquus internus abdominis using cross-stitch sutures, as well as the careful manipulation of tissues, are of great importance. Gastrotomy is even feasible on terrapins through a partial detachment of the stomach from the liver, enabling a sufficient presentation of the stomach.","1924":"In this review the following possibilities of indirect detection of causal agents in selected animal parasitoses are discussed: Detection of serum antibodies by ELISA, IFAT and other test systems in leishmaniasis of dogs, babesiosis of horse, cattle and dog, and in toxoplasmosis of cat and various intermediate host species. In leishmaniasis of dogs the specificity of serodiagnosis can be improved by additional Western-Blot analysis. New approaches are provided by the detection of antigens circulating in serum (i.e. in dirofilariasis of dogs) or excreted in faeces (copro-antigens) (i.e. in intestinal parasitoses). Some of the last mentioned techniques are still under evaluation. A new trend in the diagnosis of parasitoses is the application of DNA technologies for the specific identification of causal agents. Some examples are discussed.","1925":"The Swiss animal welfare legislation, which restricts experiments on animals, entered into force in 1981. The discussions, the legal prescriptions, the official guidelines and the ethical principles for animal experimentation issued by scientists are treated. The legislation has slowly brought about positive effects. Animal experimentation shows for several reasons a remarkable decline in the last years. Research on alternative methods to animal experiments was substantially promoted. Further improvements in the field of animal experimentation are requested.","1926":"The eradication of Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis\/Infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR\/IPV) in Switzerland is reviewed. In 1978 IBR was reported in dairy cattle in the Eastern part of Switzerland. No preexisting eradication program was available at that time. In 1983, following a period of hesitation, the legal basis for the eradication of IBR was issued. This aim was achieved by: i) Controls and restrictions of the traffic of susceptible animals in order to prevent further transmission of IBR. ii) Slaughter of seropositive cattle, based on the assumption that animals with antibodies to BHV 1 were virus carriers and therefore an IBR-virus-reservoir. iii) The fact that besides the cattle population no BHV 1 reservoir existed in Switzerland. iv) Never licensing IBR-vaccines because they were not able to prevent the infection and the establishment of latency. The costs of the eradication program amounted to approx. SFr. 114,000,000. A total of 51,911 animals were slaughtered in order to eradicate IBR. An amount of SFr. 5,000,000 per annum is estimated to be necessary in order to maintain the favourable situation concerning IBR. In the future, the experience concerning IBR is applied for the prevention and control of other infectious diseases in the Swiss cattle population.","1927":"","1928":"Brain macrophages play an important role in the CNS. We review some biological aspects of brain macrophages in vivo and in vitro. The criteria and methods used for the identification of these cells are considered. They include some morphological features such as the use of histochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for internal and surface components. In the second part of this review, we describe the role of brain macrophages in canine distemper encephalitis as proposed earlier by us. Studies in cultured dog glial cells infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) have shown that brain macrophages stimulated by anti-CDV antibodies will release reactive oxygen species as measured by chemiluminescence. This response depends on the presence of viral antigens on the surfaces of infected cells and is mediated by the interaction of antigen-bound antibodies with Fc receptors on brain macrophages. These observations support the hypotheses that brain macrophages may contribute to the damage of the white matter observed in canine distemper encephalitis.","1929":"This article reviews the radiologic examination of the canine cauda equina. The radiographic technique and interpretation of survey radiographs, radiographs with the spine in flexion and extension, tomography and contrast procedures, the diagnostic value and limits of these methods are discussed. The diseases which may cause cauda equina compression and the radiographic findings are described and illustrated.","1930":"The intestine is richly populated with lymphoid tissue capable of initiating and effecting a wide variety of immunologic reactions. These reactions have consequences not only for the gut itself but for the body in general, and have established the importance of the gut as an immunologic organ. Among the outer and inner surfaces of our body, the 200 to 300 m2 of the gut contrast with the 2 m2 of the skin, and the 80 m2 of the lung. At the inner surface of the intestine, our organism contacts intimately bacteria, parasites, enzymes, toxins, a wide variety of dietary substances and their breakdown products. The essential barrier against the permanent antigenic burden is the mucosa. Its integrity depends on the continual replication, maturation, and metabolism of its constituents. Additional defense functions are exerted by the mucus, lysozyme, phagocytes, other cells, humoral factors and biological response modifiers involved in inflammatory and immune reactions. Some of these factors are being produced very close to the surface at which they act. The sum of the mechanical, humoral, cellular, immunologic and non-immunologic defense factors of the intestinal mucosa constitutes the mucosal block. However, the block is not complete. Rather, a continuous antigenic uptake through the epithelial layer takes place. The specialized structures of Peyer's patches, solitary lymph follicles, appendix vermiformis and their associated epithelium allow a controlled antigen uptake (sampling). Because of the heavy antigenic load, the intestine can be described as the most important immunologic contact organ of our body. The antigens may give rise to local and systemic immune reactions with antibody production, or the suppression of systemic immunologic responses to ingested antigens (\"oral tolerance\").","1931":"As in monogastric species, food intake in ruminants is regulated from meal to meal. The prandial stimulation of taste receptors and gastrointestinal chemo- and mechanoreceptors as well as hepatic chemoreceptors contributes to satiety. All these receptors are apparently connected with the brain by vagal afferents. A physiological satiety function of prandially released gastrointestinal and pancreatic hormones in ruminants is uncertain. Food stimuli affect feeding also through autonomic reflexes which regulate reticulo-rumen motility. All informations from the periphery are finally integrated in the hypothalamus. The exact role of the various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides involved in the control of feeding is as yet largely unknown.","1932":"","1933":"Limb fractures in cattle have to be treated as emergencies. The success or failure of treatment depends on a careful examination and adequate emergency treatment by the veterinarian. The most important rules in an emergency treatment are the evaluation of the general systemic conditions and the initiation of whatever supportive care is required. Further attention should be paid to thoroughly rinsing and disinfecting open wounds and to immobilizing fractures for transport purposes. In 39 cases the localisation and the type of fracture were determined and the clinical relevance of a careful examination and emergency treatment was evaluated. Metacarpal fractures were the most common type of fracture. Open fractures were more likely to occur in cases of insufficient immobilisation than with properly attended patients (p less than 0,01). Open fractures have a poorer prognosis than closed fractures (p less than 0.002).","1934":"In a collaborative study with small-animal veterinary surgeons, dogs with fur and skin conditions were treated with biotin (approximately 5 mg biotin\/10 kg body weight\/day) for 3 to 5 weeks. In total 119 cases could be treated which were reported to show symptoms such as dull coat, brittle hair, loss of hair, scaly skin, pruritus or dermatitis. Cases requiring other treatments with e.g. glucocorticoids, were excluded from the study. In 60% of the cases all symptoms were reported to be cured after the biotin treatment and in a further 31% an improvement was noted; in only 9% no effect was recorded. All breeds responded but to a variable extent: e.g. in Poodles the response was lower (no response in 6 out of 11 cases) than in Alsatians where all improved and 14 out of 29 were completely cured. The results confirm the favourable effect of biotin for treatment of fur and skin conditions in dogs.","1935":"By means of a kinetic UV-assay, lipase activity was determined in various organs of the fowl as well as laboratory, domestic and zoo animals and the resulting tissue distribution patterns were established for the respective species. For the validation of the assay, lipase contained in canine pancreatic extracts was inhibited by tetrahydrolipostatin, a selective inhibitor of pancreatic lipase. In all examined species, the pancreas proved to be the organ with the highest lipase activity. Apart from considerable individual variation with regard to the pancreatic content of lipase, important species differences were observed and the possible causes of these findings are discussed.","1936":"","1937":"The anatomical-pathological findings of 15 woolly monkeys were comparable with those described in man with essential benign or malignant hypertension. Kidneys revealed arterio- and arteriolosclerosis or an onion peel-like proliferation, in some cases necrotizing endarteritis. Obesity due to restricted physical activity, unnatural feeding, and psychical and physical stress could have contributed to the development of this condition. Further, high vulnerability of the genus woolly monkey is postulated. Thus, essential hypertension of woolly monkeys appears to be a multifactorial disease.","1938":"9 Giardia-free calves were artificially infected with 1.5-5.1 x 10(6) Giardia cysts originating from Swiss cattle (\"bovine isolates\"). In 4 of these animals the course of infection was examined. After prepatent periods of 7-8 days all calves excreted high numbers of Giardia cysts for 60-112 days. During patency on 44% of the examination days Giardia cysts and antigen could be detected simultaneously in faecal samples using the flotation method and a sandwich-ELISA, respectively. With the exception of light diarrhoea lasting only for some days at the beginning of patency no other symptoms occurred. Further 5 artificially infected calves were submitted to autopsy. Giardia trophozoites were detected in 4 calves in the jejunum and in 1 animal in the ileum (peroxidase-antiperoxidase method). All animals were simultaneously infected with Campylobacter spp. and\/or Rota- and Corona-virus. Electronmicroscopically mucosal attachment sites of Giardia trophozoites had intact microvilli and enterocytes. In various parts of the intestine blunting and flattening of the villi and cellular infiltrations of the mucosa were present. These alterations in calves are generally associated with bacterial and\/or viral infections of calves. A Swiss bovine Giardia cyst-isolate was transmitted to 4 Giardia-free conventionally maintained lambs which excreted Giardia cysts after prepatent periods of 10-21 days for 31-61 days.","1939":"Most endocrinological studies are normally performed on several animal groups: one group for the determination of hormonal levels in tissues and plasma under basal conditions, a second group for the same determinations after \"in vivo\" treatment of the animals (stimulation or inhibition of the endocrine activities) and two additional groups for morphological investigations. Surgical approaches belong not rarely to the \"in vivo\" treatment of the animals. Moreover, the results from the different animal groups have to be extrapolated. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we have developed two \"in vitro\" models by means of which we can study on the tissues from the same animal: 1. function and structure of the hypothalamus and 2. function and structure of isolated pituitary cells. By using these models we can considerably reduce the number of animals needed for the studies, replace the \"in vivo\" by the \"in vitro\" experiments and refine the methods avoiding, among others, the extrapolation of results.","1940":"One of the vaccines that were used in 1988 to immunize the Swiss national cattle population against foot-and mouth disease (FMD) was apparently not stable. Data, provided by the manufacturer, indicated a high initial antigenic content for serotype O. Protection experiments at the end of the vaccination campaign, however, indicated a substantial loss of serotype O antigen in the vaccine. Serological data, obtained during the campaign indicated that only 12% of the primovaccinated animals and 63% of previously vaccinated animals received an amount of FMD viral antigen sufficient to induce protective immunity. The primovaccinated animals were revaccinated in fall 1988 with a new batch provided by the same manufacturer. The new vaccine induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies in primo- and an anamnestic response in revaccinated cattle.","1941":"Protection of the Swiss national cattle herd against foot-and mouth disease is attempted by annual vaccination with inactivated trivalent (O, A, C) vaccines. With the serotype A5 as an example, this paper demonstrates the procedure of potency testing. Serological data obtained with two vaccines in primovaccinated feeder bulls showed that neutralizing antibodies developed within 7 to 14 days post vaccination. There was no statistically significant difference in the anti-serotype antibody titers induced by each of the vaccines; differences were seen between anti-O serotype and anti-A serotype antibody titers, regardless of which vaccine was used. Epidemiological analyses with about 3000 cattle demonstrated that single-vaccinated, and to a lesser degree twice-vaccinated, animals often had short lived immunity; that is, the antibody titers waned within a few months. In contrast, the majority of thrice and multiple vaccinated animals maintained relatively high antibody titers throughout the twelve month period of observation.","1942":"In order to investigate the specificity of low titer antibodies to BHV 1, twelve cattle were subjected to stress and dexamethasone treatment. They were monitored virologically by inoculating cell cultures with naso-pharyngeal-, ocular- and vaginal- or preputial swabs and serologically by assessing the prevalence and incidence of antibodies to bovine, caprine-, porcine-, and equine herpesviruses and to bovine leukemia virus. Antibodies were classified as specific for BHV 1 if the animals excreted IBR virus, or if the antibodies neutralized BHV 1 and reacted with BHV 1 antigens, or if they reacted additionally with CapHV antigens. Animals whose sera recognized BHV 1 and BHV 2 but not other herpesviruses, were judged to have experienced both infections. Nine of the twelve animals had specific BHV 1 antibodies. With three animals the question for specificity of their antibodies remains open. Two animals experienced several herpesvirus infections. Therefore, the induction of crossreacting antibodies, directed against epitopes common to herpesviruses, could not be ruled out. The sera of one animal reacted with BHV 1 and BHV 4 antigens in ELISA tests. They did, however, not neutralize BHV 1.","1943":"This report describes the necropsy findings in 3 cats with a natural T-lymphotropic Lentivirus (FTLV) infection. The changes are compared with the \"immunodeficiency syndrome\" of humans and monkeys. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of the FTLV and the significance of a dual infection with FTLV and Spumavirus is
