","334":"Falls are a common clinical problem in the acute care setting, and fall-related injuries can include fractures, subdural hematomas, excessive bleeding, and even death (Hitcho et al., 2004). Several instruments are used clinically to estimate a patient's risk of falling. The STRATIFY (Oliver, Britton, Seed, Martin, &amp; Hopper, 1997), the Morse Fall Scale (Morse, Black, Oberle, &amp; Donahue, 1989), and the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model (Hendrich, Bender, &amp; Nyhuis, 2003) are three instruments widely used in clinical practice by nurses. To be clinically useful, a fall risk assessment instrument should be easy to use with only a small number of items, perform consistently across target populations, and have evidence-based scoring and good inter-rater reliability. Oliver (2008), author of the STRATIFY tool, questioned the merits of any instrument used to assess fall risk in hospital inpatients in the absence of interventions to modify the risk factors. Too often, patient assessment and assignment of a score become required tasks and resulting data do not drive interventions. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between scores on the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model (HIIFRM) and fall occurrence as recorded in the medical record for patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure in an acute care inpatient setting. To determine if a relationship existed between the occurrence of a fall and the HIIFRM score, the study used a random sample of patients who fell during admission and a matched control group of patients who did not fall. Fall cases were identified based on an admission Medical Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) (Schmidt &amp; Stegman, 2008) of stroke or secondary International Classification of Diseases (9th revision) (ICD-9) code (Hart, Stegman, &amp; Ford, 2009) of heart failure or diabetes. Non-faller matched controls were selected at random from the same admission MS-DRG or secondary ICD-9 code as the fall case and matched for admission month\/year. This study found HIIFRM scores to be related significantly to falls in the sample of patients with diabetes, but not in the sample of patients with heart failure. Although the HIIFRM demonstrated statistically significant mean differences in scores between patients who fell and those who did not, clinically the instrument failed to identify 44% of patients who did fall as being at high risk for falling. Given the negative consequences associated with falling, not identifying 44% of high-risk patients can have significant clinical implications. In this study, HIIFRM scores were related to falls among inpatients in an acute care hospital who had a diabetes diagnosis, but not a heart failure diagnosis. The differ ences between patient groups based on medical diagnoses suggest the instrument does not perform equally across patient groups, nursing skill levels, or clinical units. Though the findings are statistically significant, the clinical concemrn remains that a large percentage of patients who fell were scored as low risk using the HIIFRM instrument. At some level, every patient admitted to an acute care hospital is at risk for falls. Patients sick enough to be in the hospital have underlying disease, are receiving physiologically altering medications and treatments, and are likely experiencing pain, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and other symptoms that interfere with cognitive and physical functioning. The key to preventing falls among hospitalized patients may lie in addressing how the hospital environment creates risk. Nurses should continue to improve the ability to assess fall risk and implement interventions that modify or eliminate risk when possible. ","335":"Nurse-to-nurse relationships are a key component in determining the health of a work setting. Because of the impact that such relationships can have on patients, health care organizations, nurses, and the nursing profession, it is imperative to understand how nurses relate to each other. The purpose of this article is to present findings from a study that explored how direct-care nurses relate to each other in everyday interactions on patient care units. This study used a mixed method research design. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected, but only qualitative findings are presented. Eighty-two staff registered nurses responded to a researcher-developed online questionnaire. A qualitative content analysis was conducted. Data were categorized according to questions then analyzed for key thoughts. Common themes were determined. Findings revealed participants had considered leaving the profession, and had considered leaving or had left a nursing unit because of poor nurse relationships. Participants identified environmental characteristics necessary for good relations. The crucial role nurse managers play in establishing good nurse relations was highlighted. Participants cited new graduate actions that could enhance relationships with expert nurses. Participants also noted missing factors on many nursing units that are essential for good nurse-to-nurse relationships. Positive nursing relationships are the key to establishing a healthy place of work. Only when positive nurse-to-nurse relationships are established can healthy work environments be created and sustained for nurses in the future. ","336":"","337":"The current era of health care delivery, with its focus on providing high-quality, affordable care, presents many challenges to hospital-based health professionals. The prevention and treatment of hospital malnutrition offers a tremendous opportunity to optimize the overall quality of patient care, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. Unfortunately, malnutrition continues to go unrecognized and untreated in many hospitalized patients. This article represents a call to action from the interdisciplinary Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition to highlight the critical role of nutrition intervention in clinical care and suggest practical ways for prompt diagosis and treatment of malnourished patients and those at risk for malnutrition. We underscore the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to addressing malnutrition both in the hospital and in the acute post-hospital phase. It is well recognized that malnutrition is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Although data vary across studies, available evidence shows early nutrition intervention can reduce complication rates, length of hospital stay, re-admission rates, mortality, and cost of care. The key is to identify patients systematically who are malnourished or at risk and to promptly intervene. We present a novel care model to drive improvement, emphasizing the following six principles: (1) create an institutional culture where all stakeholders value nutrition; (2) redefine clinicians' roles to include nutrition care; (3) recognize and diagnose all malnourished patients and those at risk; (4) rapidly implement comprehensive nutrition interventions and continued monitoring; (5) communicate nutrition care plans; and (6) develop a comprehensive discharge nutrition care and education plan.","338":"","339":"","340":"","341":"Alcohol-related problems are substantial in this society.

A pilot study was conducted among nurses on medical-surgical and intensive care units to identify differences in nurses' perceptions of RN-MD collaborative efforts. Collaboration between nurses and physicians is essential in fostering interdisciplinary relationships. Specialty practice may influence the quality of this collaboration. Effective communication and collegial RN-MD relationships are critical to improved patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in nurses' perceptions of collaborative efforts between nurses and physicians in medical-surgical (MSUs) units versus intensive care units (ICUs). A descriptive survey methodology was employed. Nurses in three ICUs and eight MSUs within a 975-bed Magnet hospital completed a 25-item Nurse-Physician Relationship survey, used in previous studies on RN-MD communication. The sample (N = 170) consisted of 54% medical-surgical nurses and 46% ICU nurses. No statistically significant differences were found in the demographic variables between the MSU and ICU nurses except for educational degree. A greater percentage of ICU nurses held a bachelor's degree. This study found that although some differences existed in ICU and MSU nurses' perceptions of RN-MD collaboration, there are more similarities between the two areas. Overall, nurses were satisfied with RN-MD relationships, with 75% of ICU and 65% of MSU nurses reporting satisfaction (p = 0.110). MSU nurses were less likely to participate in interdisciplinary rounds than ICU nurses (p &lt; 0.001).

Evidence-based nursing literature has challenged this long-standing traditional nursing practice. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence from a randomized clinical trial and rationale supporting evidence-based inquiry concerning return of bowel sounds as an unreliable indicator of the end of POI after abdominal surgery. Time (days) of return of bowel sounds after abdominal surgery was compared to the time (days) of first postoperative flatus, an indicator of the end of POI, in 66 patients recovering from abdominal surgery randomized to receive standard care compared to those who received standard care plus a rocking chair intervention. Pearson's correlation between time to first flatus and return of bowel sounds for combined groups was not significant (r = 0.231, p = 0.062, p &lt; 0.05) indicating that time to return of bowel sounds and time to first flatus were not associated.

The simple answer to these requests is that the nurse is prohibited in participating in assisted suicide or euthanasia by the Code of Ethics for Nurses and by the ANA position statements (ANA, 1994). In this article, the author attempted to present a balanced view of the ethical issues on both sides of the question of PAS. Honoring the autonomy of a patient does not require participation in PAS. However, nurses who support PAS speak of the patient's autonomous choice and their choice to assist in ending suffering of terminally ill patients. As more states pass ballot initiatives or laws supporting PAS, nurses will be faced with the legal choice to participate in the process of PAS by providing information on the option and attending to the patient who has taken the lethal drug.

At his retirement dinner, a factory worker accepted accolades for his years of dedicated service. In his farewell speech, he noted that for 40 years the factory used his hands but never his brains. His expertise and knowledge were never acknowledged or solicited. Consequently he watched in silence for years as directives came down from managers and leaders that were totally unrealistic and bore no relevance to the reality in which he worked. And he watched the initiatives fail.

A nursing goal for the postoperative patient is always prevention of wound dehiscence. Recognition of risk factors is essential. For example, older males with ascites are at very high risk. Prevention of wound infection and mechanical stress on the incision are important. Management of dehisced wounds may include immediate surgery if bowel is protruding from the wound. If surgery is not needed, management is essentially the same as that of any other wound through maintenance of a moist wound environment, reduction of bioburden and pain, and promotion of granulation tissue. Mortality rates associated with dehiscence have been reported between 14% and 50% (Hanif et al., 2000; Waqar et al., 2005). One of the complications (morbidity) of dehisced wounds is an incisional hernia, which develops in an estimated 43% of patients (van't et al., 2004). Researchers followed 126 patients who had wound dehiscence repair for a mean of 37 months and found that 31% of the hernias were diagnosed more than 2 years postoperatively. Nurses need to ensure adequate nutrition and reduced tension on the abdomen, and implement measures to prevent incisional infections.","837":"","838":"Nurses are responsible for continual patient evaluation as they address patient needs, provide essential input into evaluation and risk stratification, and make recommendations regarding prevention-oriented strategies (American Health Consultants, 2002a).

Chaplains are trained extensively to provide spiritual care to patients, families, and staff as they assist in meeting the organization's mission to provide patient-centered care. Spiritual assessment is a tool for nurses to recognize patient's needs for spiritual intervention and chaplain referral. By collaborating with chaplains, nurses can help develop an organizational infrastructure capable of timely responsiveness to patients' spiritual needs.","860":"The increasing incidence of morbid obesity suggests that the quantity of bariatric surgical procedures will continue to multiply each year. Bariatric surgery has become an accepted approach to weight management with the additional benefit of resolution of several co-morbidities. However, quality nursing care and effective patient teaching are essential to achieve positive patient outcomes. Nursing care along the continuum of the bariatric surgical experience is key to positive outcomes for these patients. Throughout the process from selection for surgery to follow-up visits in the physician's office, the nurse can have a significant impact on the response of the patient and family to the surgical procedure. During the selection process, the nurse can explain the required diagnostic tests and their rationale and conduct a thorough medical history, informing the physician of pertinent information that might affect the patient's outcomes. Patient and family teaching begins at this stage with information about the peri-operative experience. Bariatric surgery results in a major lifestyle change for the patient. This change will evolve over time as weight is lost, and the patient adjusts to changes in eating patterns, body image, and the perceptions of others. The nurse should see that the patient has appropriate referral information for support services and should follow up to see that the patient and family availed themselves of these services. The patient's stay in acute care is usually very short. Clearly the patient and family need to go home with specific information about drinking\/eating, caring for drainage tubes, skin and wound care, ambulation, self-care, and signs and symptoms that require medical attention. Nursing care should include written information and demonstrations of such activities as care of the wounds and drains. The nurse should assure that the patient leaves the hospital with a call number if questions arise at home. Ideally the nurse, patient, and family should have an opportunity for private education sessions prior to discharge. During the postoperative period, the nurse in the physician's office can serve as a source of information and a monitor of patient progress. Follow-up calls to patients and families after surgery are very helpful in determining the welfare of the patient, offering suggestions for managing the patient's care, and learning if any complications are developing. At the same time, the nurse can assess the psychological condition of the patient and his or her adjustment to a new way of living.","861":"","862":"","863":"The successful leader and manager have two very important challenges: to scan the horizon and not be thrown into crisis by not seeing predictable surprises, and to recognize the longer, more pervasive trends that are in the more distant future. In reality, these two processes merge and drive the future planning of the patient care enterprise. The merger of the operational imperatives and the long-range trends that create very different ways for us to work is the work of leaders. In the words of Senge and colleagues (2004), we are at the end of the era of hierarchical leadership and at the beginning of distributed, shared networks where \"...becoming a real human being really is the primary leadership issue of our time\" (p. 186).

A specific class of HIV medication, protease inhibitors, has been implicated in elevating serum levels of triglyceride and cholesterol in treated individuals (Green, 2002; Penzak &amp; Chuck, 2000). However, current treatments for hyperlipidemia in HIV are not always effective and can be dose-limited due to interactions with HAART regimens (Currier, 2002). Dietary guidelines by the NCEP have been recommended as the first-line approach to managing this condition. Well-controlled studies are needed to test the effectiveness of the NCEP diet on HIV-positive individuals. Published studies have focused primarily on dietary counseling and have lacked randomization, control groups, and adequate description of the counseling intervention. Because the mechanism associated with dyslipidemia and HAART is not fully understood, rigorously controlled dietary studies may provide the opportunity to investigate how diet metabolically affects lipid levels during HAART treatment.","882":"","883":"","884":"","885":"All of us have signature strengths that make us unique and valuable.

The competencies derived from their interviews reflect leadership and management skills that medical-surgical nurses need to function as effective charge nurses.","1048":"Because nurses' early recognition of patient problems is a key aspect in producing positive patient outcomes in acute care settings, the skill of early recognition, the language to describe it, and institutional support of the nurse to use it in a consistent way are critical to quality care. An important aspect of clinical judgment, the early recognition of patient problems is described from the perspective of medical-surgical nurses.","1049":"Older adult patients often have poor, fragmented sleep when they are in the hospital. The factors contributing to sleep disturbance in hospitalized elders will be explored, and interventions for promoting sleep among these patients will be discussed.","1050":"","1051":"","1052":"","1053":"The surgical procedure for patients undergoing lung and heart-lung transplantation, conventional discharge criteria following the surgery, and common transplant-related complications will be reviewed. The impact of transplant on the routine illnesses experienced by people living in the community will also be discussed, including special nursing considerations when caring for patients following lung or heart-lung transplantation. As transplant recipients return to their homes and communities, it is likely that they will first come to their local hospital to care of these illnesses. Knowledgeable care by nurses in that local hospital will promote successful recovery.","1054":"Not all individuals respond to drug therapy equally, nor do they all experience the adverse effects that are reported to occur with specific medications. Current prescribing practices, which use medications shown to be safe and effective in selected patient populations, vary in their efficacy and also in the development of adverse effects among individual patients. The new and rapidly evolving discipline of pharmacogenetics has the potential to match specific drugs to the genetic profile of the individual. Pharmacogenetics is likely to significantly affect the selection of prescription medicines and offers the potential for optimal safety and efficacy in an individual patient. Nurses must understand this new science in order to respond to inquiries and questions from their patients and to contribute to the development of protocols for delivering genome-based pharmacotherapeutics.","1055":"Age-related macular degeneration (ARM) is a progressive, chronic condition that results when the macula degenerates and central vision is lost. ARM is the leading cause of vision loss in Americans over age 50 and is a major public health concern. Very little is known about the etiology of ARM. Deciphering the genetic susceptibility associated with ARM holds great promise for gaining a better understanding of the disease, identifying at-risk individuals, and developing interventions and treatments.","1056":"The use of companions to monitor and care for patients at risk for adverse events is a long-standing practice with patients who require constant observation such as with suicide precautions. While offering a potential benefit of increased safety, the use of companions in subacute care is inefficient and poses an enormous financial strain on the health care system. Development of a protocol for assessing at-risk patients, and collaboration between care-givers through a performance improvement initiative, made it possible to reduce companion expenditure without negatively affecting patient outcomes.","1057":"Evidence-based medicine has been defined as \"the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients\" (Sackett et al., 1996). Evidence-based nursing takes the process one step further by integrating clinical expertise and the data obtained from performance improvement processes with clinical research. The challenge nursing then faces is to translate the evidence into practice. Although central line removal is a fairly common procedure, it is not benign. The authors noted an opportunity for improving central venous catheter (CVC) removal from the subclavian or internal jugular vein. Based upon previously recommended guidelines (Kim et al., 1998), the authors set out to determine the best practice related to CVC removal.","1058":"The dramatic increase in the older adult population necessitates health promotion efforts to maintain and improve the health of this vulnerable population. The majority of older adults are women who experience unique social and personal factors that influence their health behaviors. Increased physical activity is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality; however, few older adults participate in regular physical activity. This lack of participation is more prevalent in older women. The purpose of this literature review is to identify the determinants of physical activity of older women. Only after identifying the unique intrapersonal characteristics that influence women's physical activity can interventions be developed to meet their unique needs.","1059":"","1060":"","1061":"","1062":"Types of blood products commonly transfused by medical-surgical nurses include packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. This review of ABO and Rh blood types and leukocyte-reduced blood products serves as a basis for understanding the nursing procedures and assessments that are a vital part of a safe and successful transfusion. The concept of the seroconversion window is described and related to the latest donor blood testing procedures such as nucleic acid amplification, which has markedly reduced the time between the initial contracting of viral illnesses such as HIV and hepatitis C and the point at which they may be detected in donor blood.","1063":"Today, an increasing number of nurses are applying new genetic knowledge in their practice, research, and educational activities. Just as the evolving precepts of biology, psychology, sociology, medicine, public health, and economics are integral to the practice of quality patient care, so too are those of genomics. The International Society of Nurses in Genetics (ISONG) has taken up the challenge of educating nurses about genetics and about ways such knowledge might be integrated into practice.","1064":"The researchers explored the failure of older women to attend cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction, and examined facilitating and inhibiting factors in making lifestyle changes.

A primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy individuals, especially in young adults. It is important for adult-health\/medical-surgical nurses to understand the recommended medical treatment and nursing management for patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Nursing care includes preventing complications, resolving the pneumothorax, managing pain, and educating the patient and family.","1066":"During the last 10 years, fibromyalgia (FM) research shifted focus from psychological and behavioral issues to sleep, nociception, and neuroendocrinology. Although there are still no definitive markers of the disease, a barrage of studies in physiological, psychological, and behavioral sciences have now dispelled the belief that FM is solely psychosomatic. Studies in the late 1990s as well as in the early part of the current decade reaffirm earlier research that sleep abnormalities and alterations in nociception may partly be responsible for FM. While sleep research shows that FM patients typically are deficient in stage IV (restorative) sleep, most current studies in nociception now affirm that patients with FM exhibit low serum serotonin in combination with increased substance P levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Although there is still no cure, treatment aimed at promoting sleep, interrupting nociception, and actively involving patient and family in FM management can bring lifetime control for the disease.","1067":"","1068":"","1069":"","1070":"Osteoporosis is a chronic and potentially debilitating disease. A painful consequence of osteoporosis is a compression fracture of a vertebral body of the spine. These fractures can lead to physical deformities and emotional trauma. Treatment options for these fractures are limited and occasionally ineffective. New surgical advances in treating vertebro-compression fractures are evolving. Kyphoplasty is a new surgical procedure now being used to treat the painful compression fracture.","1071":"Patients who were taught about their health problems while waiting in the clinic (n = 104) were significantly more satisfied with the education received during that visit than the control group (n = 101). The longer patients waited in the clinic to see their providers, the less satisfied they were with the clinic visit.","1072":"Technologies for genetically modifying foods hold tremendous promise for meeting important public health challenges in this century. By keeping informed of the ongoing development of genetically modified foods, nurses can effectively educate patients about the benefits and risks of these foods and promote informed decision making.","1073":"A series of nursing care variances related to the procedure of catheterizing male patients stimulated an evidence-based practice project designed to define best practice for the technique of inserting male catheters.

Strategies are presented for dealing with angry patients, physicians, and colleagues.","1081":"Patients' pain experiences with peripheral i.v. insertions, with and without the use of lidocaine for anesthesia, were described and compared. Patients reported their preferences related to the use of intradermal lidocaine with future i.v. insertions.","1082":"Medication administration errors (MAE) continue as major problems for health care institutions, nurses, and patients. However, MAEs are often the result of system failures leading to patient injury, increased hospital costs, and blaming. Costs include those related to increased hospital length of stay and legal expenses. Contributing factors include distractions, lack of focus, poor communication, and failure to follow standard protocols during medication administration.","1083":"","1084":"","1085":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. As information from the Human Genome Project becomes integrated into clinical practice, knowledge of genetic susceptibility for lung cancer will be used to identify persons at risk and to individualize treatments, such as prescribing chemoprevention. Nurses who assimilate genetic information into their practice can help patients to understand the implications of genetic susceptibility to lung cancer for their health and to reduce their disease risk with adaptive behaviors.","1086":"Testicular cancer (TC) strikes men between the ages of 15 and 35. If detected early, this disease can be irradicated in virtually every patient. Unfortunately, several hundred men will die from this disease each year. Research has shown that men do not know the importance of testicular self-examination, and they are not knowledgeable about TC. Nurses should be able to discuss treatment modalities, side-effect management related to those treatments, and special issues dealing with sexuality, body image perception, and infertility.","1087":"Patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy and\/or head and neck radiotherapy frequently experience treatment side effects. Oral complications are among the most common problems associated with these therapies. These sequelae include mucositis, oral hemorrhage, infection, and xerostomia (dry mouth). Occasionally, oral complications are so severe that the cancer treatment must be reduced or even terminated. By providing comprehensive care, nurses work to help prevent, identify, and manage these oral sequelae, and thus maximize quality of life. Limiting the effects of oral sequelae increases patient adherence to treatment protocols, improves the quality of life, and increases the odds of long-term survival.","1088":"Natural rubber gloves have been acknowledged as the best protective devices available for protecting health care personnel and their patients against viral transmission and infectious fluids. Yet, with the adoption of standard safety precautions and the increase in the use of gloves, an increasing number of people are being affected with latex allergy. Negative publicity related to latex allergy has resulted in health care personnel deciding against using the highly protective natural rubber gloves. The relationship between natural rubber gloves and latex protein allergy needs to be better understood in order for health care professionals to make an informed choice in their selection of gloves.","1089":"Older adults experiencing acute pain are often underassessed and undertreated. This review summarizes recommendations from an evidence-based practice guideline on acute pain management in older adults. Key areas highlighted are pain assessment and monitoring, patient education, pharmacologic management, and nonpharmacologic management.","1090":"","1091":"","1092":"Traditionally, many health care providers consider clinical genetics to be a field that only applies to specialists who provide services to individuals with rare single-gene or chromosomal disorders. But this concept is changing rapidly. In the year 2000, nine of the ten leading causes of mortality, including heart disease, have identified genetic components. As patient advocates and health care providers, nurses have a responsibility to become familiar with genetic advances and translate this knowledge into improved individualized care for patients.","1093":"The majority of stroke survivors receive home care.

Geriatric depression has a unique presentation that differs from the hallmarks of depressive illness documented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The \"masked\" presentation of depression in the elderly contributes to problems with accurate assessment, prompt diagnosis, and treatment. Without treatment, there are serious negative consequences for elderly clients such as cognitive impairment, physical disability, social isolation, and suicide. Enhancing professional nurses' awareness of this underrecognized mental health problem among elderly patients is a significant priority.","1502":"Visiting hours play an integral role in the intensive care unit (ICU) for both patients and health care providers. Family members offer support and comfort to patients during critical illnesses. Nurses, however, often view visiting hours as intrusive and time consuming. The issue of restricted versus open visiting hours continues in many ICUs, and the advantages and disadvantages of both types of visitation must be weighed before selecting the visiting hours appropriate for the institution.","1503":"A hospital implemented a computerized documentation system using planned change. Nursing staff and managers were instrumental in reviewing and choosing a system, and implementing and evaluating project results. The project was successful and raised some critical ethical and legal issues.","1504":"Tube feedings have been a common nutritional support technique for decades.

In addition there must be a provision for informed consent so that subjects can freely choose whether or not to participate. Most health care agencies have adopted this as the standard for conducting research. The ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, guide review boards in making decisions for protecting human subjects. The standards for conducting QM studies have not been as explicit, but it seems that similar ethical principles could provide a guiding framework. To protect human subjects in QM studies, it has been suggested that studies be submitted to an IRB when they: (a) are prospective, (b) have potential scientific merit, and\/or (c) may have application beyond the study setting. In addition even when data are coming from existing sources or patient records and used only for evaluation purposes within the study setting, mechanisms for ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and consent need consideration.","1568":"","1569":"The motivation for implementing the Emergency Support Team was the unique situation of being the only hospital within a resort area with limited resources for supporting families in crisis. As the program developed, broader implications for the service were identified. Educational needs became more apparent and programs were instituted to orient and educate the team members. The comfort level of the volunteers increased as they developed skills in working with families in crisis. Events such as unexpected death are difficult times for families. The support given by the team member can turn a catastrophic situation into one that is remembered by the family as a compassionate experience.","1570":"","1571":"","1572":"Staff nurse complaints about the length and quality of intershift report led to a quality improvement project.

Intravenous heparin is the mainstay of therapy but thrombolytic agents hold promise for reducing long-term pulmonary problems. Medical-surgical nurses must be prepared to recognize the early symptoms of pulmonary embolism and intervene to prevent untoward outcomes.","1590":"Nurses have a responsibility to maximize safety while minimizing the use of restraints. Assessment of fall risk factors for a specific population can aid in planning alternatives to the use of restraints while maximizing safety.","1591":"Peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) affords many cancer patients the opportunity to use their own blood cells to recover from ablative chemotherapy. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) also affords cancer patients this same opportunity; however, more problems are associated with this treatment. Medical-surgical nurses caring for patients receiving these innovations must be aware of current care guidelines.","1592":"Before using research in practice, nurses must adequately evaluate both the scientific merit of the research and its potential impact on practice. This column outlined some basic questions that nurses can ask when reading research for use in practice. Many references in the nursing literature may be helpful to nurses who want to increase their skill in evaluating research for use in their own practice settings (Alderman, 1985; Haller et al., 1979; Jacox &amp; Prescott, 1978; Stetler &amp; Marram, 1976; Topham &amp; DeSilva, 1988). Clinical nurses have tangible knowledge of their own practice settings. This knowledge makes them the ideal decision-makers in determining when research findings are suitable for their practice. They should continue to develop their skills in evaluating research and form networks with nurse researchers, nursing faculty, clinical nurse specialists, and others with advanced research preparation to assist them in evaluating research and to validate their own assessment of the research. This kind of collaboration will promote prudent use of research findings in nursing practice.","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"Patient education is an essential component of nursing care.
