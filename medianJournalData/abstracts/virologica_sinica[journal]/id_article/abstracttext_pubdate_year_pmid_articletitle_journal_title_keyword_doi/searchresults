global spread of enteroviruses (EVs) has become more frequent, severe and life-threatening. Intereron (IFN) I has been proved to control EVs by regulating IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) expression. 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases 3 (OAS3) is an important ISG in the OAS\/RNase L antiviral system. The relationship between OAS3 and EVs is still unclear. Here, we reveal that OAS3, superior to OAS1 and OAS2, significantly inhibited EV71 replication in vitro. However, EV71 utilized autologous 3C protease (3Cpro) to cleave intracellular OAS3 and enhance viral replication. Rupintrivir, a human rhinovirus 3C protease inhibitor, completely abolished the cleavage of EV71 3Cpro on OAS3. And the proteolytically deficient mutants H40G, E71A, and C147G of EV71 3Cpro also lost the ability of OAS3 cleavage. Mechanistically, the Q982-G983 motif in C-terminal of OAS3 was identified as a crucial 3Cpro cutting site. Further investigation indicated that OAS3 inhibited not only EV71 but also Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), Enterovirus D68 (EVD68), and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA6) subtypes. Notably, unlike other four subtypes, CA16 3Cpro could not cleave OAS3. Two key amino acids variation Ile36 and Val86 in CA16 3Cpro might result in weak and delayed virus replication of CA16 because of failure of OAS and 3AB cleavage. Our works elucidate the broad anti-EVs function of OAS3, and illuminate a novel mechanism by which EV71 use 3Cpro to escape the antiviral effect of OAS3. These findings can be an important entry point for developing novel therapeutic strategies for multiple EVs infection.","2":"","3":"Virus identification is a prerequisite not only for the early diagnosis of viral infectious diseases but also for the effective prevention of epidemics. Successful cultivation is the gold standard for identifying a virus, according to the Koch postulates. However, this requires screening for a permissive cell line, which is traditionally time-, reagent- and labor-intensive. Here, a simple and easy-to-operate microfluidic chip, formed by seeding a variety of cell lines and culturing them in parallel, is reported for use in virus cultivation and virus-permissive host-cell screening. The chip was tested by infection with two known viruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and influenza virus H1N1. Infection with EV71 and H1N1 caused significant cytopathic effects (CPE) in RD and MDCK cells, respectively, demonstrating that virus cultivation based on this microfluidic cell chip can be used as a substitute for the traditional plate-based culture method and reproduce the typical CPE caused by virus infection. Using this microfluidic cell chip method for virus cultivation could make it possible to identify an emerging virus in a high-throughput, automatic, and unprecedentedly fast way.","4":"Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) has been widely used to assemble large DNA constructs. One of the significant obstacles hindering assembly efficiency is the presence of error-prone DNA repair pathways in yeast, which results in vector backbone recircularization or illegitimate recombination products. To increase TAR assembly efficiency, we prepared a dual-selective TAR vector, pGFCS, by adding a PADH1-URA3 cassette to a previously described yeast-bacteria shuttle vector, pGF, harboring a PHIS3-HIS3 cassette as a positive selection marker. This new cassette works as a negative selection marker to ensure that yeast harboring a recircularized vector cannot propagate in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid. To prevent pGFCS bearing ura3 from recombining with endogenous ura3-52 in the yeast genome, a highly transformable Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, VL6-48B, was prepared by chromosomal substitution of ura3-52 with a transgene conferring resistance to blasticidin. A 55-kb genomic fragment of monkeypox virus encompassing primary detection targets for quantitative PCR was assembled by TAR using pGFCS in VL6-48B. The pGFCS-mediated TAR assembly showed a zero rate of vector recircularization and an average correct assembly yield of 79% indicating that the dual-selection strategy provides an efficient approach to optimizing TAR assembly.","5":"In this study, we described a \"cloning-free\" approach to generate monoclonal antibodies with heavy chain class-switch recombination in hybridoma cells. A controllable tetracycline-inducible AID (Tet-On) expression system of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) was generated in an anti-influenza B virus monoclonal IgM hybridoma 7G1 and single cell lines with four kinds of mouse IgG subclasses were isolated. We next observed that 7G1 of different subclasses displayed slightly different reactive spectrums against influenza B virus and provided different protection efficiency in the mice model, this may be since different antibody classes have different Fc structures and thus have different Fc-based functions. Our methodology may represent a general strategy to enhance antibody properties with \"on-demand\" class-switch recombination, and even somatic hypermutation, without the need for antibody engineering or recombinant protein expression. Moreover, this strategy is convenient for investigating the functions of different isotypes of a therapeutic antibody during early drug discovery and development.","6":"A significant number of mycoviruses have been identified that are related to plant viruses, but their evolutionary relationships are largely unexplored. A fusarivirus, Rhizoctonia solani fusarivirus 4 (RsFV4), was identified in phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani) strain XY74 co-infected by an alphaendornavirus. RsFV4 had a genome of 10833 nt (excluding the poly-A tail), and consisted of four non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes an 825 aa protein containing a conserved helicase domain (Hel1). ORF3 encodes 1550 aa protein with two conserved domains, namely an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and another helicase (Hel2). The ORF2 and ORF4 likely encode two hypothetical proteins (520 and 542 aa) with unknown functions. The phylogenetic analysis based on Hel2 and RdRp suggest that RsFV4 was positioned within the fusarivirus group, but formed an independent branch with three previously reported fusariviruses of R. solani. Notably, the Hel1 and its relatives were phylogenetically closer to helicases of potyviruses and hypoviruses than fusariviruses, suggesting fusarivirus Hel1 formed an evolutionary link between these three virus groups. This finding provides evidence of the occurrence of a horizontal gene transfer or recombination event between mycoviruses and plant viruses or between mycoviruses. Our findings are likely to enhance the understanding of virus evolution and diversity.","7":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype B and C are two major genotypes that are prevalent in Asia and differ in natural history and disease progression. The impact of HBV genotypes on viral replication and protein expression has been explored by the transfection of hepatoma cells with replication-competent HBV DNA, which mimics the later stages of the viral life cycle. However, the influence of HBV genotypes on the early events of viral infection remains undetermined, mainly due to the difficulties in obtaining sufficient infectious viral particles for infection assays. Here, we report that a high-titer HBV inoculum can be generated from the transient transfection-based cell model after optimizing transfection conditions and modifying the HBV-expressing construct. By performing in vitro infection assays using transiently transfected derived viruses, we found that clinical genotype C isolates possessed higher infectivity than genotype B isolates. Moreover, we identified a naturally occurring mutation sL21S in small hepatitis B surface protein, which markedly decreased the infectivity of HBV genotype C isolates, but not that of genotype B isolates. In summary, using infectious viral particles provided by the optimized transient transfection-based cell model, we have been able to investigate a wide range of HBV variants on viral infectivity, which may contribute to our understanding of the reasons for different clinical outcomes in HBV infections and the development of therapeutic drugs targeting the early stages of HBV life cycle.","8":null,"9":"","10":null,"11":null,"12":"","13":"The nationwide COVID-19 epidemic ended in 2020, a few months after its outbreak in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. Most COVID-19 cases occurred in Hubei Province, with a few local outbreaks in other provinces of China. A few studies have reported the early SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in several large cities or provinces of China. However, information regarding the early epidemics in small and medium-sized cities, where there are still traditionally large families and community culture is more strongly maintained and thus, transmission profiles may differ, is limited. In this study, we characterized 60 newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Anyang as a representative of small and medium-sized Chinese cities, compared them with more than 400 reference genomes from the early outbreak, and studied the SARS-CoV-2 transmission profiles. Genomic epidemiology revealed multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions in Anyang and a large-scale expansion of the epidemic because of the large family size. Moreover, our study revealed two transmission patterns in a single outbreak, which were attributed to different social activities. We observed the complete dynamic process of single-nucleotide polymorphism development during community transmission and found that intrahost variant analysis was an effective approach to studying cluster infections. In summary, our study provided new SARS-CoV-2 transmission profiles representative of small and medium-sized Chinese cities as well as information on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains during the early COVID-19 epidemic in China.","14":"","15":"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious and acute hemorrhagic viral disease with a high mortality approaching 100% in domestic pigs. ASF is an endemic in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Now, it has been spreading to many countries, especially in Asia and Europe. Due to the fact that there is no commercial vaccine available for ASF to provide sustainable prevention, the disease has spread rapidly worldwide and caused great economic losses in swine industry. The knowledge gap of ASF virus (ASFV) pathogenesis and immune evasion is the main factor to limit the development of safe and effective ASF vaccines. Here, we will summarize the molecular mechanisms of how ASFV interferes with the host innate and adaptive immune responses. An in-depth understanding of ASFV immune evasion strategies will provide us with rational design of ASF vaccines.","16":"","17":null,"18":"Since its outbreak in 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps surprising the medical community by evolving diverse immune escape mutations in a rapid and effective manner. To gain deeper insight into mutation frequency and dynamics, we isolated ten ancestral strains of SARS-CoV-2 and performed consecutive serial incubation in ten replications in a suitable and common cell line and subsequently analysed them using RT-qPCR and whole genome sequencing. Along those lines we hoped to gain fundamental insights into the evolutionary capacity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Our results identified a series of adaptive genetic changes, ranging from unique convergent substitutional mutations and hitherto undescribed insertions. The region coding for spike proved to be a mutational hotspot, evolving a number of mutational changes including the already known substitutions at positions S:484 and S:501. We discussed the evolution of all specific adaptations as well as possible reasons for the seemingly inhomogeneous potential of SARS-CoV-2 in the adaptation to cell culture. The combination of serial passage in vitro with whole genome sequencing uncovers the immense mutational potential of some SARS-CoV-2 strains. The observed genetic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro could not be explained solely by selectively neutral mutations but possibly resulted from the action of directional selection accumulating favourable genetic changes in the evolving variants, along the path of increasing potency of the strain. Competition among a high number of quasi-species in the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro population gene pool may reinforce directional selection and boost the speed of evolutionary change.","19":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic poses a global health emergency. Cellular entry of the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its spike protein interacting with cellular receptor-human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, by using lentivirus based pseudotypes bearing spike protein, we demonstrated that entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphoinositides played essential roles during this process. In addition, we showed that the intracellular domain and the catalytic activity of ACE2 were not required for efficient virus entry. Finally, we showed that the current predominant Delta variant, although with high infectivity and high syncytium formation, also entered cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These results provide new insights into SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and present proof of principle that targeting viral entry could be an effective way to treat different variant infections.","20":"","21":null,"22":"","23":null,"24":"","25":"Advancements in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of antibody repertoires (Ig-Seq) have unprecedentedly improved our ability to characterize the antibody repertoires on a large scale. However, currently, only a few studies explored the influence of chronic HIV-1 infection on human antibody repertoires and many of them reached contradictory conclusions, possibly limited by inadequate sequencing depth and throughput. To better understand how HIV-1 infection would impact humoral immune system, in this study, we systematically analyzed the differences between the IgM (HIV-IgM) and IgG (HIV-IgG) heavy chain repertoires of HIV-1 infected patients, as well as between antibody repertoires of HIV-1 patients and healthy donors (HH). Notably, the public unique clones accounted for only a negligible proportion between the HIV-IgM and HIV-IgG repertoires libraries, and the diversity of unique clones in HIV-IgG remarkably reduced. In aspect of somatic mutation rates of CDR1 and CDR2, the HIV-IgG repertoire was higher than HIV-IgM. Besides, the average length of CDR3 region in HIV-IgM was significant longer than that in the HH repertoire, presumably caused by the great number of novel VDJ rearrangement patterns, especially a massive use of IGHJ6. Moreover, some of the B cell clonotypes had numerous clones, and somatic variants were detected within the clonotype lineage in HIV-IgG, indicating HIV-1 neutralizing activities. The in-depth characterization of HIV-IgG and HIV-IgM repertoires enriches our knowledge in the profound effect of HIV-1 infection on human antibody repertoires and may have practical value for the discovery of therapeutic antibodies.","26":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection, was first reported in 2010 in China with an initial fatality of up to 30%. The laboratory confirmation of SFTSV infection in terms of detection of viral RNA or antibody levels is critical for SFTS diagnosis and therapy. In this study, a new luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay based on pREN2 plasmid expressing SFTSV NP gene and tagged with Renilla luciferase (Rluc), was established and used to investigate the levels of antibody responses to SFTSV. Totally 464 serum samples from febrile patients were collected in the hospital of Shaoxing City in Zhejiang Province in 2019. The results showed that 82 of the 464 patients (17.7%) had antibody response to SFTSV, which were further supported by immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). Further, qRT-PCR and microneutralization tests showed that among the 82 positive cases, 15 patients had viremia, 10 patients had neutralizing antibody, and one had both (totally 26 patient). However, none of these patients were diagnosed as SFTS in the hospital probably because of their mild symptoms or subclinical manifestations. All the results indicated that at least the 26 patients having viremia or neutralizing antibody were the missed diagnosis of SFTS cases. The findings suggested the occurrence of SFTS and the SFTS incidence were higher than the reported level in Shaoxing in 2019, and that LIPS may provide an alternative strategy to confirm SFTSV infection in the laboratory.","27":"Retroviruses exclusively infect vertebrates, causing a variety of diseases. The replication of retroviruses requires reverse transcription and integration into host genomes. When infecting germline cells, retroviruses become inherited vertically, forming endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). ERVs document past viral infections, providing molecular fossils for studying the evolutionary history of retroviruses. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in understanding the diversity and evolution of retroviruses from the perspectives of viral fossils, and discuss the effects of ERVs on the evolution of host biology.","28":"","29":null,"30":"Pegivirus (family Flaviviridae) is a genus of small enveloped RNA viruses that mainly causes blood infections in various mammals including human.

Three novel pegiviruses, namely Passer montanus pegivirus, Leucosticte brandti pegivirus and Montifringilla taczanowskii pegivirus, were identified from different wild birds, and one new rodent pegivirus, namely Phaiomys leucurus pegivirus, was identified from Blyth's vole. Interestingly, the pegiviruses of non-mammalian origin discovered in this study substantially broaden the host range of Pegivirus to avian species. Co-evolutionary analysis showed virus-host co-divergence over long evolutionary timescales, and indicated that pegiviruses largely followed a virus-host co-divergence relationship. Overall, this work extends the biodiversity of the Pegivirus genus to those infecting wild birds and hence revises the host range and evolutionary history of genus Pegivirus.","31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":"","35":null,"36":null,"37":"","38":null,"39":"Although tremendous efforts have been made to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection, HIV-1\/AIDS remains a major threat to global human health. The combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), although able to suppress HIV-1 replication, cannot eliminate the proviral DNA integrated into the human genome and thus requires lifelong treatment that may lead to various side effects. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) related gene-editing systems have been developed and designed as effective ways to treat HIV-1 infection. However, new gene-targeting tools derived from or functioning like CRISPR\/Cas9, including base editor, prime editing, SHERLOCK, DETECTR, PAC-MAN, ABACAS, pfAGO, have been developed and optimized for pathogens detection and diseases correction. Here, we summarize recent studies on HIV-1\/AIDS gene therapy and provide more gene-editing targets based on studies relating to the molecular mechanism of HIV-1 infection. We also identify the strategies and potential applications of these new gene-editing technologies for HIV-1\/AIDS treatment in the future.

To investigate the epidemiological characteristics as well as genetic features of CVA10 currently circulating in Shanghai, China, we collected a total of 9,952 sporadic HFMD cases from January 2016 to December 2020. In the past five years, CVA10 was the fourth prevalent causatives associated with HFMD in Shanghai and the overall positive rate was 2.78%. The annual distribution experienced significant fluctuations over the past five years. In addition to entire VP1 sequencing, complete genome sequencing and recombination analysis of CVA10 isolates in Shanghai were further performed. A total of 64 near complete genomes and 11 entire VP1 sequences in this study combined with reference sequences publicly available were integrated into phylogenetic analysis. The CVA10 sequences in this study mainly belonged to genogroup C and presented 91%-100% nucleotide identity with other Chinese isolates based on VP1 region. For the first time, our study reported the appearance of CVA10 genogroup D in Chinese mainland, which had led to large-scale outbreaks in Europe previously. The recombination analysis showed the recombination break point located between 5,100 nt and 6,700 nt, which suggesting intertypic recombination with CVA16 genogroup D. To conclusion, CVA10 genogroup C was the predominant genogroup in Shanghai during 2016-2020. CVA10 recombinant genogroup D was firstly reported in circulating in Chinese mainland. Continuous surveillance is needed to better understand the evolution relationships and transmission pathways of CVA10 to help to guide disease control and prevention.","41":"Diarrhea is the third leading cause of death in developing countries in children under the age of five. About half a million children die of diarrhea every year, most of which in developing countries. Viruses are the main pathogen of diarrhea. In China, the fecal virome of children with diarrhea has been rarely studied. Using an unbiased viral metagenomics approach, we analyzed the fecal virome in children with diarrhea. Many DNA or RNA viruses associated with diarrhea identified in those fecal samples were mainly from six families of Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae. Among them, the family of Caliciviridae accounts for the largest proportion of 78.42%, following with Adenoviridae (8.94%) and Picornaviridae (8.36%). In addition to those diarrhea-related viruses that have already been confirmed to cause human diarrhea, the viruses not associated with diarrhea were also identified including anellovirus and picobirnavirus. This study increased our understanding of diarrheic children fecal virome and provided valuable information for the prevention and treatment of viral diarrhea in this area.","42":"After dengue virus (DENV) infection, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is easy to occur when the neutralizing antibody (NAb) gradually decreases to a sub-neutralizing concentration. In this cohort surveillance, we utilized sera samples collected from dengue fever patients at different convalescent phases in Jinghong City, to investigate the dynamic change rule of DENV-specific antibodies, and to analyze the risk of ADE caused by secondary infection with heterologous serotypes DENVs. For baseline serosurvey, 191 four-year and 99 six-year sera samples during convalescence were collected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The positive rate of DENV-specific immunoglobulin G was 98.4% in 2017, which significantly decreased to 82.8% in 2019. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of NAb decreased from 1:155.35 to 1:46.66. Among 290 overall samples, 73 paired consecutive samples were used for follow-up serosurvey. In four-year sera, the GMTs of NAb against DENV-3 and cross-reactive antibodies against DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-4 were 1:167.70, 1:13.80, 1:18.54 and 1:45.26, respectively, which decreased to 1:53.18, 1:10.30, 1:14.60 and 1:8.17 in six-year sera. In age-stratified analysis, due to the increasing number of ADE positive samples from 2017 to 2019 in 31-40 and 51-60 years groups, the risk of ADE in DENV-4 infection was positively associated with the extension of convalescent phase, and the odd ratio was higher than other groups. With the recovery period lengthened, the risk of secondary infection with DENV-1 and DENV-2 was reduced.

The insertion of a \"KRTA\" motif at hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) occurred in the early stage of HP H7N9 variants. During the co-circulation, the HACS of HP-H7N9 variants were more polymorphic in birds and humans. Although HP-H7N9 variants, unlike the H5 subtype virus, exhibited the insertions of basic and non-basic amino acids, the underlying function of those insertions and substitutions remains unclear. The results of bioinformatics analysis indicated that the PEVPKRKRTAR\/G motif of HACS had become the dominant motif in China. Then, we generated six H7N9 viruses bearing the PEIPKGR\/G, PEVPKGR\/G, PEVPKRKRTAR\/G, PEVPKGKRTAR\/G, PEVPKGKRIAR\/G, and PEVPKRKRR\/G motifs. Interestingly, after the deletion of threonine and alanine (TA) at HACS, the H7N9 viruses manifested decreased thermostability and virulence in mice, and the PEVPKRKRTAR\/G-motif virus is prevalent in birds and humans probably due to its increased transmissibility and moderate virulence. By contrast, the insertion of non-basic amino acid isoleucine and alanine (IA) decreased the transmissibility in chickens and virulence in mice. Remarkably, the I335V substitution of H7N9 virus enhanced infectivity and transmission in chickens, suggesting that the combination of mutations and insertions of amino acids at the HACS promoted replication and pathogenicity in chickens and mice. The ongoing evolution of H7N9 increasingly threatens public health and poultry industry, so, its comprehensive surveillance and prevention of H7N9 viruses should be pursued.","45":"","46":null,"47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":null,"55":"","56":"Currently, various porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) variants emerged worldwide with different genetic characteristics and pathogenicity, increasing the difficulty of PRRS control.

The genome of HBap4-2018 is 15,003 nucleotides in length, and compared with NADC30-like PRRSV, nsp2 of HBap4-2018 has an additional continuous deletion of five amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome and ORF5 showed that HBap4-2018 belonged to lineage 8 of PRRSV-2, which was characterized by highly variable genome. However, HBap4-2018 was classified into lineage 1 based on phylogenetic analysis of nsp2, sharing higher amino acid homology (85.3%-85.5%) with NADC30-like PRRSV. Further analysis suggested that HBap4-2018 was a novel natural recombinant PRRSV with three recombinant fragments in the genome, of which highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) served as the major parental strains, while NADC30-like PRRSV served as the minor parental strains. Five recombination break points were identified in nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, nsp9 and ORF6, respectively, presenting a novel recombinant pattern in the genome. Piglets inoculated with HBap4-2018 presented typical clinical signs with a mortality rate of 60%.

A majority of the infections are initiated by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a major role in various biological processes, including gene expression, cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as viral infection and antiviral immune responses. Although, miRNAs have been found to regulate viral infections, their role in CVB3 infection remains poorly understood. In the previous study, miRNA microarray results showed that miR-324-3p expression levels were significantly increased when cells and mice were infected with CVB3. It was also found that miR-324-3p downregulated TRIM27 and decreased CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, analysis of downstream signaling of TRIM27 revealed that, miR-324-3p inhibited CVB3 infection, and reduced cytopathic effect and viral plaque formation by reducing the expression of TRIM27. In vivo, miR-324-3p decreased the expression of TRIM27, reduced cardiac viral replication and load, thereby strongly attenuating cardiac injury and inflammation. Taken together, this study suggests that miR-324-3p targets TRIM27 to inhibit CVB3 replication and viral load, thereby reducing the cardiac injury associated with VM.","58":null,"59":"","60":null,"61":null,"62":"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved Ser\/Thr kinase that includes mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2.

The unavailability of effective therapeutic strategies for HBV suggests that clarification of the pathogenesis of HBV infection is urgently required. Increasing evidence has shown that HBV infection can activate the mTOR pathway, indicating that HBV utilizes or hijacks the mTOR pathway to benefit its own replication.

Here, we report the modification of AcMNPV-WIV-Syn1 into a novel bacmid, AcBac-Syn, which can be used as a backbone for Bac-to-Bac system. To achieve this, a vector contained a LacZ:attTn7 and egfp cassette was constructed, and recombined with a linearized AcMNPV-WIV-Syn1 genome by transformation-associated recombination in yeast to generate bacmid AcBac-Syn. The bacmid was then transfected to insect cells and the rescued virus showed similar biological characteristics to the wild-type virus in terms of the kinetics of budded virus production, the morphology of occlusion bodies, and the oral infectivity in insect larvae. For demonstration, a red fluorescent protein gene Dsred was transposed into the attTn7 site by conventional Bac-to-Bac method, and the transfection and infection assays showed that AcBac-Syn can be readily used for foreign gene insertion and expression. AcBac-Syn has several advantages over the conventional AcMNPV bacmids, such as it contains an egfp reporter gene which facilitates visualization of virus propagation and titration; its DNA copy numbers could be induced to a higher level in E. coli; and the retaining of the native polyhedrin gene in the genome making it an attractive system for studying the functions of gene related to occlusion body assembly and oral infection.","66":"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in endemic regions of Asia. The neurotropism of JEV and its high-efficiency replication in neurons are the key events for pathogenesis. Revealing the interplay between virus and host cells in metabolic facet is of great importance both for unraveling the pathogenesis mechanisms and providing novel antiviral targets. This study took advantage of the integration analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics to depict the metabolic profiles of neurons during the early stage of JEV infection. Increased glycolysis and its branched pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in glucose utilization, and the catabolic patterns of lipid metabolism were created to facilitate the biosynthesis of precursors needed for JEV replication in neurons. Pharmacological inhibitions of both glycolysis pathway and PPP in neurons suggested its indispensable role in maintaining the optimal propagation of JEV. In addition, analysis of metabolomic-transcriptomic regulatory network showed the pivotal biological function of lipid metabolism during JEV infection. Several pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites were significantly up-regulated and might partially be responsible for the progression of encephalitis. These unique metabolic reprogramming features might give deeper insight into JEV infected neurons and provide promising antiviral approaches targeting metabolism.","67":null,"68":"Viruses depend on host cellular metabolism to provide the energy and biosynthetic building blocks required for their replication. In this study, we observed that influenza A virus (H1N1), a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with an eight-segmented genome, enhanced glycolysis both in mouse lung tissues and in human lung epithelial (A549) cells. In detail, the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2), the first enzyme in glycolysis, was upregulated in H1N1-infected A549 cells, and the expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) was upregulated in H1N1-infected mouse lung tissues. Pharmacologically inhibiting the glycolytic pathway or targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), the central transcriptional factor critical for glycolysis, significantly reduced H1N1 replication, revealing a requirement for glycolysis during H1N1 infection. In addition, pharmacologically enhancing the glycolytic pathway further promoted H1N1 replication. Furthermore, the change of H1N1 replication upon glycolysis inhibition or enhancement was independent of interferon signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest that influenza A virus induces the glycolytic pathway and thus facilitates efficient viral replication. This study raises the possibility that metabolic inhibitors, such as those that target glycolysis, could be used to treat influenza A virus infection in the future.","69":null,"70":"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes severe encephalitis in humans and animals.

However, the effect of AXL on JEV infection has not yet been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that AXL is down-regulated after JEV infection in the late stage. JEV NS2B-3 protein specifically interacted with AXL, and promoted AXL degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. AXL-degradation increased cell apoptosis by disrupting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/Akt signal transduction. In addition, the degradation of AXL promoted JEV release to supernatant, whereas the virus in the cell lysates decreased. The supplementation of AXL ligand Gas6 inhibited the JEV-mediated degradation of AXL.

In this study, a nanobody phage-displayed library was constructed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of alpacas immunized with the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV. Four positive clones were selected after four rounds of bio-panning and subjected to recombinant expression in E. coli. Further biological identification demonstrated that one of the nanobodies, S14, showed high affinity to SARS-CoV RBD and potent neutralization activity at the picomole level against SARS-CoV pseudovirus. A competitive inhibition assay showed that S14 blocked the binding of SARS-CoV RBD to either soluble or cell-expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

The HVR-2 of genotype BA9 had nine amino acid substitutions with a frequency more than 10%, while the sequences with T290I and T312I were all from 2018 to 2019. One N-glycosylation site at 237 was identified among ON1 sequences, while two N-glycosylation sites (296 and 310) were identified in the 60-nucleotide duplication region of BA9. To conclusion, ON1 and BA9 were the predominant genotypes in China during 2015-2019. For the genotypes ON1 and BA9, the G gene exhibited relatively high diversity and evolved continuously.","77":"","78":null,"79":"","80":"Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a re-emerging virus that can cause life-threatening yellow fever disease in humans. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, little is known about the replication mechanism of YFV, and there are still no available specific anti-YFV medicines. Herein, by introducing the Renilla luciferase gene (Rluc) into an infectious clone of YFV vaccine strain 17D, we generated a recombinant virus 17D-Rluc.2A via reverse genetics approaches. The 17D-Rluc.2A had similar plaque morphology and comparable in vitro growth characteristics with its parental strain. Importantly, the reporter luciferase was efficiently expressed in 17D-Rluc.2A-infected mammalian and mosquito cells, and there was a good linear correlation between intracellular luciferase expression and extracellular infectious virion reproduction. Furthermore, by a combination of the 17D-Rluc.2A reporter virus and selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) technology, the conserved 5'-SLA element was shown to be essential for YFV replication, highlighting the capability of 17D-Rluc.2A in the investigation of YFV replication. At last, we demonstrated that two compounds with distinct anti-viral mechanisms can effectively inhibit the viral propagation in 17D-Rluc.2A-infected cells, demonstrating its potential application in the evaluation of anti-viral medicines. Taken together, the 17D-Rluc.2A serves as a useful tool for the study of YFV replication and anti-YFV medicine development.","81":"The Japanese encephalitis serogroup of the neurogenic Flavivirus has a specific feature that expresses a non-structural protein NS1' produced through a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF). Herein, C19orf66, a novel member of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) products, exhibited significant activity of antagonizing Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Overexpression of C19orf66 in 293T cells significantly inhibited JEV replication, while knock-down of endogenous C19orf66 in HeLa cells and A549 cells significantly increased virus replication. Notably, C19orf66 had an inhibitory effect on frameshift production of JEV NS1'. The inhibition was more significant when C19orf66 and JEV NS1-NS2A were co-expressed in the 293T cells. Both C19orf66-209 and C19orf66-Zincmut did not significantly change the NS1' to NS1 ratio and had weaker antiviral effects than C19orf66. Similarly, C19orf66-209 and C19orf66-Zincmut had no significant effect on the expression of the JEV NS3 protein, whose expression was down-regulated by C19orf66 via the lysosome-dependent pathway. These findings suggest that C19orf66 may possess at least two different mechanisms of antagonizing JEV infection. This study identified C19orf66 as a novel interferon-stimulated gene product that can inhibit JEV replication by targeting -1 PRF and the NS3 protein. The study provides baseline information for the future development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents against JEV.","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":null,"86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human and animal pathogens that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), characterized by severe diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs, is a highly lethal disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and causes substantial losses in the swine industry worldwide. However, currently available commercial drugs have not shown great therapeutic effects. In this study, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was applied to screen a library containing 1,590 compounds and identified two compounds, 3-(aminocarbonyl)-1-phenylpyridinium and 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone, that target the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of PEDV. These compounds are of low molecular weight (MW) and greatly inhibited the activity of this enzyme (IC50 values were obtained in this study). Furthermore, these compounds exhibited antiviral capacity against another member of the CoV family, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Here, the inhibitory effects of these compounds against CoVs on Vero cells and feline kidney cells were identified (with EC50 values) and cell viability assays were performed. The results of putative molecular docking models indicate that these compounds, labeled compound 1 and compound 2, contact the conserved active sites (Cys144, Glu165, Gln191) of 3CLpro via hydrogen bonds. These findings provide insight into the antiviral activities of compounds 1 and 2 that may facilitate future research on anti-CoV drugs.","91":"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection could disrupt neurogenesis and cause microcephaly in neonates by targeting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The tumor suppressor p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death have been suggested to be activated upon ZIKV infection, yet the detailed mechanism is not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ZIKV-encoded proteins in the activation of p53 signaling pathway and found that, among the ten viral proteins, the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) of ZIKV most significantly activated the transcription of p53 target genes. Using the immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry approach, we identified that ZIKV-NS5 interacted with p53 protein. The NS5-p53 interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. In addition, the MTase domain of NS5 and the C-terminal domain of p53 were mapped to be responsible for the interaction between these two proteins. We further showed that ZIKV-NS5 was colocalized with p53 and increased its protein level in the nuclei and able to prolong the half-life of p53. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated expression of ZIKV-NS5 in hNPCs led to an apparent cell death phenotype. ZIKV-NS5 promoted the cleavage of PARP1 and significantly increased the cell apoptosis of hNPCs. Taken together, these findings revealed that ZIKV-NS5 is a previously undiscovered regulator of p53-mediated apoptosis in hNPCs, which may contribute to the ZIKV-caused abnormal neurodevelopment.","92":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has precipitated multiple variants resistant to therapeutic antibodies. In this study, 12 high-affinity antibodies were generated from convalescent donors in early outbreaks using immune antibody phage display libraries. Of them, two RBD-binding antibodies (F61 and H121) showed high-affinity neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, whereas three S2-target antibodies failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Following structure analysis, F61 identified a linear epitope located in residues G446-S494, which overlapped with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding sites, while H121 recognized a conformational epitope located on the side face of RBD, outside from ACE2 binding domain. Hence the cocktail of the two antibodies achieved better performance of neutralization to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, these two antibodies also showed efficient neutralizing activities to the variants including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and reacted with mutations of N501Y, E484K, and L452R, indicated that it may also neutralize the recent India endemic strain B.1.617. The unchanged binding activity of F61 and H121 to RBD with multiple mutations revealed a broad neutralizing activity against variants, which mitigated the risk of viral escape. Our findings revealed the therapeutic basis of cocktail antibodies against constantly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and provided promising candidate antibodies to clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients infected with broad SARS-CoV-2 variants.","93":"Human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-B55) is a re-emergent acute respiratory disease pathogen that causes adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Previous studies have shown that the receptor of HAdV-B14, which genome is highly similar with HAdV-B55, is human Desmoglein 2 (DSG2). However, whether the receptor of HAdV-B55 is DSG2 is undetermined because there are three amino acid mutations in the fiber gene between HAdV-B14 and HAdV-B55. Here, firstly we found the 3T3 cells, a mouse embryo fibroblast rodent cell line which does not express human DSG2, were able to be infected by HAdV-B55 after transfected with pcDNA3.1-DSG2, while normal 3T3 cells were still unsusceptible to HAdV-B55 infection. Next, A549 cells with hDSG2 knock-down by siRNA were hard to be infected by HAdV-B3\/-B14\/-B55, while the control siRNA group was still able to be infected by all these types of HAdVs. Finally, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy indicated visually that Cy3-conjugated HAdV-B55 viruses entered A549 cells by binding to DSG2 protein. Therefore, DSG2 is a major receptor of HAdV-B55 causing adult CAP. Our finding is important for better understanding of interactions between adenoviruses and host cells and may shed light on the development of new drugs that can interfere with these processes as well as for the development of potent prophylactic vaccines.","94":"","95":"Similar to that of other enteroviruses, the replication of enterovirus 71 (EV71) occurs on rearranged membranous structures called replication organelles (ROs). Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III (PI4KB), which is required by enteroviruses for RO formation, yields phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) on ROs. PI4P then binds and induces conformational changes in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to modulate RdRp activity. Here, we targeted 3D polymerase, the core enzyme of EV71 ROs, and found that the host factor Annexin A2 (ANXA2) can interact with 3D polymerase and promote the replication of EV71. Then, an experiment showed that the annexin domain of ANXA2, which possesses membrane-binding capacity, mediates the interaction of ANXA2 with EV71 3D polymerase. Further research showed that ANXA2 is localized on ROs and interacts with PI4KB. Overexpression of ANXA2 stimulated the formation of PI4P, and the level of PI4P was decreased in ANXA2-knockout cells. Furthermore, ANXA2, PI4KB, and 3D were shown to be localized to the viral RNA replication site, where they form a higher-order protein complex, and the presence of ANXA2 promoted the PI4KB-3D interaction. Altogether, our data provide new insight into the role of ANXA2 in facilitating formation of the EV71 RNA replication complex.","96":"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogenic virus known to cause central nervous system (CNS) diseases in humans, and has become an increasing public health threat nowadays. The rates of TBEV infection in the endemic countries are increasing. However, there is no effective antiviral against the disease. This underscores the urgent need for tools to study the emergence and pathogenesis of TBEV and to accelerate the development of vaccines and antivirals. In this study, we reported an infectious cDNA clone of TBEV that was isolated in China (the WH2012 strain). A beta-globin intron was inserted in the coding region of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene to improve the stability of viral genome in bacteria. In mammalian cells, the inserted intron was excised and spliced precisely, which did not lead to the generation of inserted mutants. High titers of infectious progeny viruses were generated after the transfection of the infectious clone. The cDNA-derived TBEV replicated efficiently, and caused typical cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaques in BHK-21 cells. In addition, the CPE and growth curve of cDNA-derived virus were similar to that of its parental isolate in cells. Together, we have constructed the first infectious TBEV cDNA clone in China, and the clone can be used to investigate the genetic determinants of TBEV virulence and disease pathogenesis, and to develop countermeasures against the virus.","97":"","98":null,"99":"","100":null,"101":"","102":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection identified as a definitive human carcinogen is increasingly being recognized for its role in carcinogenesis of human cancers.

Given by the biologically distinct HPV-related OPSCC and a more favorable prognosis compared to HPV-negative tumors, clinical trials on de-escalation treatment strategies for these patients have been studied. It is therefore raised the questions for the patient stratification if treatment de-escalation is feasible. Moreover, understanding the crosstalk of HPV-mediated malignancy and immunity with clinical insights from the proportional response rate to immune checkpoint blockade treatments in patients with HNSCC is of importance to substantially improve the treatment efficacy. This review discusses the biology of HPV-related HNSCC as well as successful clinically findings with promising candidates in the pipeline for future directions.

Here, we analyzed a clinical influenza A (H1N1) pdm09-infected patient case hospitalized for two months in Guangdong (from December 14, 2019 to February 15, 2020). This isolate, named A\/Guangdong\/LCF\/2019 (LCF\/19), was genetically sequenced, rescued by reverse genetics, and phylogenetically analyzed in the context of other relevant pdm09 isolates. Compared with earlier isolates, this pdm09 virus's genetic sequence contains four substitutions, S186P, T188I, D190A, and Q192E, of the hemagglutinin (HA) segment at position 186-192 (H3 numbering) in the epitope Sb, and two of which are located at the 190-helix. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the epitope Sb started undergoing a rapid antigenic change in 2018. To characterize the pathogenicity of this novel substitution motif, a panel of reassortant viruses containing the LCF\/2019 HA segment or the chimeric HA segment with the four substitutions were rescued. Kinetic growth data revealed that the reassortant viruses, including the LCF\/2019 with the PTIAAQE substitution, propagated faster than those rescued ones having the STTADQQ motif in the epitope Sb in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. The HI test showed that the binding activity of escape mutant to 2018 pdm09 sera was weaker than GLW\/2018, suggesting that old vaccines might not effectively protect people from infection.

Here, we report that the regimen of 25HC combined with antiretroviral therapy (ART), provides profound immunological modulation towards inhibiting viral replication in chronically SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). Compared to the ART alone, this regimen more effectively controlled SIV replication, enhanced SIV-specific cellular immune responses, restored the ratio of CD4\/CD8 cells, reversed the hyperactivation state of CD4+ T cells, and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in chronically SIV-infected RMs. Furthermore, the in vivo safety and the preliminary pharmacokinetics of the 25HC compound were assessed in this RM model. Taken together, these assessments help explain the profound relationship between cholesterol metabolism, immune modulation, and antiviral activities by 25HC.

Human HCR3A and dog P[3] RV VP8*s recognized glycans with terminal sialic acid and hemagglutinated the red blood cells, while bat P[3] VP8* showed neither binding to glycans nor hemagglutination. However, the bat P[3] VP8* mutant of C189Y obtained the ability to hemagglutinate the red blood cells, while human P[3] HCR3A\/M2-102 mutants of Y189C lost the ability. Sequence alignment and structural analysis indicated that residue 189 played an important role in the ligand recognition and may contribute to the cross-species transmission. Structural superimposition exhibited that bat P[3] VP8* model was quite different from the simian P[3] Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) P[3] VP8*, indicating that bat P[3] RV was relatively distinct and partially contributed to the no binding to tested glycans.

Four virus isolates that caused cytopathic effects in BHK-21 cells were successfully isolated from sandfly specimens collected from chicken pens and sheep pens. Phylogenetic analyses of the L, M and S gene segments of the viruses revealed that the four virus strains represented the previously isolated WUXV. The minimum infection rate (MIR) of the virus isolated from the sheep pen was 3.21, and the MIR of the virus isolated from the chicken pen was 3.45. The positive rates of Wuxiang virus neutralizing antibodies in serum samples of local healthy people and domestic chickens were 8.7% (4\/46) and 100% (4\/4), respectively, suggesting that Wuxiang virus can infect human and animal.

As the main components of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), PML can inhibit the replication of many medically important viruses including IAV. However, the mechanism of PML against IAV is unclear. In the present study, we found PML was induced in response to IAV infection and ectopic expression of PML could inhibit IAV replication, whereas knockdown of endogenous PML expression could enhance IAV replication. Further studies showed that PML increased the expression of FBXW7 by inhibiting its K48-linked ubiquitination and enhanced the interaction between FBXW7 and SHP2, which negatively regulated IAV replication during infection. Moreover, PML stabilized RIG-I to promote the production of type I IFN. Collectively, these data indicated that PML inhibited IAV replication by enhancing FBXW7 expression in the antiviral immunity against influenza virus and extended the mechanism of PML in antiviral immunity.","115":"","116":"Genomic reassortment is an important evolutionary mechanism for influenza viruses.

A great amount of computational methods and bioinformatics databases were developed to facilitate the identification of influenza virus reassortments.

Our previous study has shown that dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection induces the transcription of a large number of abnormal HERVs loci; therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between exogenous viral infection and HERV activation further. In this study, we retrieved and reanalyzed published data on 21 transcriptomes of human cells infected with various viruses. We found that infection with different viruses could induce transcriptional activation of HERV loci. Through the comparative analysis of all viral datasets, we identified 43 key HERV loci that were up-regulated by DENV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Zika virus, measles virus, and West Nile virus infections. Furthermore, the neighboring genes of these HERVs were simultaneously up-regulated, and almost all such neighboring genes were interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are enriched in the host's antiviral immune response pathways.

PHEV was one of the first identified swine CoV and is still widespread, causing subclinical infections in pigs in several countries. PRCV, a spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection, appeared in the 1980s. PRCV is considered non-pathogenic since its infection course is mild or subclinical. Since its appearance, pig populations have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, leading to a significant reduction in the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV are enteropathogenic CoV and cause clinically indistinguishable acute gastroenteritis in all age groups of pigs.

In this study, we explored the utility of diverse HIV-1 envelope (Env) immunogens in a sequential immunization scheme as a solution to this task. This exploration stemmed from the rationale that gp145, a membrane-bound truncation form of HIV Env, may facilitate the focusing of induced antibody response on neutralizing epitopes when sequentially combined with the soluble gp140 form as immunogens in a prime-boost mode. We first showed that gp140 DNA prime-gp145 Tiantan vaccinia (TV) boost likely represents a general format for inducing potent nAb response in mice. However, when examined in rhesus macaque, this modality showed little effectiveness. To improve the efficacy, we extended the original modality by adding a strong protein boost, namely native-like SOSIP.664 trimer displayed on ferritin-based nanoparticle (NP), which was generated by a newly developed click approach. The resulting three-immunization regimen succeeded in eliciting tier-2 nAb response with substantial breadth when implemented in rhesus macaque over a short 8-week schedule. Importantly, the elicited nAb response was able to effectively contain viremia upon a heterologous SHIV challenge. Collectively, our studies highlighted that diversification of Env immunogens, in both types and formulations, under the framework of a sequential immunization scheme might open new opportunity toward HIV vaccine development.","148":"Peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) is an antioxidant enzyme with both the activities of peroxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which is involved in regulation of many cellular reactions. However, the function of PRDX6 during virus infection remains unknown. In this study, we found that the abundance of PRDX6 protein was dramatically decreased in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infected cells. Overexpression of PRDX6 inhibited FMDV replication. In contrast, knockdown of PRDX6 expression promoted FMDV replication, suggesting an antiviral role of PRDX6. To explore whether the activity of peroxidase and PLA2 was associated with PRDX6-mediated antiviral function, a specific inhibitor of PLA2 (MJ33) and a specific inhibitor of peroxidase activity (mercaptosuccinate) were used to treat the cells before FMDV infection. The results showed that incubation of MJ33 but not mercaptosuccinate promoted FMDV replication. Meanwhile, overexpression of PRDX6 slightly enhanced type I interferon signaling. We further determined that the viral 3Cpro was responsible for degradation of PRDX6, and 3Cpro-induced reduction of PRDX6 was independent of the proteasome, lysosome, and caspase pathways. The protease activity of 3Cpro was required for induction of PRDX6 reduction. Besides, PRDX6 suppressed the replication of another porcine picornavirus Senecavirus A (SVA), and the 3Cpro of SVA induced the reduction of PRDX6 through its proteolytic activity as well. Together, our results suggested that PRDX6 plays an important antiviral role during porcine picornavirus infection, and the viral 3Cpro induces the degradation of PRDX6 to overcome PRDX6-mediated antiviral function.","149":"Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) orf13 (ac13) is a conserved gene in all sequenced alphabaculoviruses. However, its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown. In this study, we found that ac13 was a late gene and that the encoded protein, bearing a putative nuclear localization signal motif, colocalized with the nuclear lamina. Deletion of ac13 did not affect viral genome replication, nucleocapsid assembly or occlusion body (OB) formation, but reduced virion budding from infected cells by approximately 400-fold compared with the wild-type virus. Deletion of ac13 substantially impaired the egress of nucleocapsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, while the OB morphogenesis was unaffected. Taken together, our results indicated that ac13 was required for efficient nuclear egress of nucleocapsids during virion budding, but was dispensable for OB formation.","150":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that causes hemorrhagic fever-like disease (SFTS) in humans with a case fatality rate up to 30%. To date, the molecular biology involved in SFTSV infection remains obscure. There are seven major genotypes of SFTSV (C1-C4 and J1-J3) and previously a reverse genetic system was established on a C3 strain of SFTSV. Here, we reported successfully establishment of a reverse genetics system based on a SFTSV C4 strain. First, we obtained the 5'- and 3'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) sequences of the Large (L), Medium (M) and Small (S) segments of a laboratory-adapted SFTSV C4 strain through rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis, and developed functional T7 polymerase-based L-, M- and S-segment minigenome assays. Then, full-length cDNA clones were constructed and infectious SFTSV were recovered from co-transfected cells. Viral infectivity, growth kinetics, and viral protein expression profile of the rescued virus were compared with the laboratory-adapted virus. Focus formation assay showed that the size and morphology of the foci formed by the rescued SFTSV were indistinguishable with the laboratory-adapted virus. However, one-step growth curve and nucleoprotein expression analyses revealed the rescued virus replicated less efficiently than the laboratory-adapted virus. Sequence analysis indicated that the difference may be due to the mutations in the laboratory-adapted strain which are more prone to cell culture. The results help us to understand the molecular biology of SFTSV, and provide a useful tool for developing vaccines and antivirals against SFTS.","151":"Lassa virus (LASV) belongs to the Mammarenavirus genus (family Arenaviridae) and causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. The glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains eleven N-linked glycans that play essential roles in GPC functionalities such as cleavage, transport, receptor recognition, epitope shielding, and immune response. We used three mutagenesis strategies (asparagine to glutamine, asparagine to alanine, and serine\/tyrosine to alanine mutants) to abolish individual glycan chain on GPC and found that all the three strategies led to cleavage inefficiency on the 2nd (N89), 5th (N119), or 8th (N365) glycosylation motif. To evaluate N to Q mutagenesis for further research, it was found that deletion of the 2nd (N89Q) or 8th (N365Q) glycan completely inhibited the transduction efficiency of pseudotyped particles. We further investigated the role of individual glycan on GPC-mediated immune response by DNA immunization of mice. Deletion of the individual 1st (N79Q), 3rd (N99Q), 5th (N119Q), or 6th (N167Q) glycan significantly enhanced the proportion of effector CD4+ cells, whereas deletion of the 1st (N79Q), 2nd (N89Q), 3rd (N99Q), 4th (N109Q), 5th (N119Q), 6th (N167Q), or 9th (N373Q) glycan enhanced the proportion of CD8+ effector T cells. Deletion of specific glycan improves the Th1-type immune response, and abolishment of glycan on GPC generally increases the antibody titer to the glycan-deficient GPC. However, the antibodies from either the mutant or WT GPC-immunized mice show little neutralization effect on wild-type LASV. The glycan residues on GPC provide an immune shield for the virus, and thus represent a target for the design and development of a vaccine.","152":null,"153":"Baculoviruses have been widely used as a vector for expressing foreign genes. Among numerous baculoviruses, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the most frequently used and it encodes 155 open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we systematically investigated the impact of 42 genes of AcMNPV on the production of infectious budded viruses (BVs) by constructing gene-knockout bacmids and subsequently conducting transfection and infection assays. The results showed that among the 39 functionally unverified genes and 3 recently reported genes, 36 are dispensable for infectious BV production, as the one-step growth curves of the gene-knockout viruses were not significantly different from those of the parental virus. Three genes (ac62, ac82 and ac106\/107) are essential for infectious BV production, as deletions thereof resulted in complete loss of infectivity while the repaired viruses showed no significant difference in comparison to the parental virus. In addition, three genes (ac13, ac51 and ac120) are important but not essential for infectious BV production, as gene-knockout viruses produced significantly lower BV levels than that of the parental virus or repaired viruses. We then grouped the 155 AcMNPV genes into three categories (Dispensable, Essential, or Important for infectious BV production). Based on our results and previous publications, we constructed a schematic diagram of a potential mini-genome of AcMNPV, which contains only essential and important genes. The results shed light on our understanding of functional genomics of baculoviruses and provide fundamental information for future engineering of baculovirus expression system.","154":null,"155":null,"156":null,"157":null,"158":null,"159":"Pseudorabies (PR), also called Aujeszky's disease, is a highly infectious disease caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV).

Currently, the role of Axl in regulating the neuroinflammation and brain damage during JE has not been investigated yet. In this study, by using Axl deficient and heterozygous control mice, we discovered that Axl deficient mice displayed accelerated JE progression and exacerbated brain damage characterized by increased neural cell death, extended infiltration of inflammatory cells, and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in comparison to control mice. Additionally, consistent with our previous report, Axl deficiency had no impact on the infection and target cell tropism of JEV in brain.

We found that M1 virus induces vacuolization of cancer cells during infection and ultimately nuclear marginalization, a typical indicator of apoptosis. Specifically, our results suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum participates in the assembly of nucleocapsids. In the early and late stage of infection, three kinds of special cytopathic vacuoles are formed and appear to be involved in the replication, maturation and release of the virus.

In this study, a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection method was developed for diagnosing ASF. As a highly sensitive method, RPA-CRISPR can detect even a single copy of ASFV plasmid and genomic DNA by determining fluorescence signal induced by collateral cleavage of CRISPR-lwCas13a (previously known as C2c2) through quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and has the same or even higher sensitivity than the traditional qPCR method. A lateral flow strip was developed and used in combination with RPA-CRISPR for ASFV detection with the same level of sensitivity of TaqMan qPCR. Likewise, RPA-CRISPR is capable of distinguishing ASFV genomic DNA from viral DNA\/RNA of other porcine viruses without any cross-reactivity. This diagnostic method is also available for diagnosing ASFV clinical DNA samples with coincidence rate of 100% for both ASFV positive and negative samples.

In this study, a total of 7387 R. microplus ticks were collected from cattle and buffalo in the northwest and southeast areas of Yunnan Province from 2015 to 2017. We investigated the virome of R. microplus using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the prevalence of important identified viruses among tick groups by RT-PCR. It revealed the presence of diverse virus concerning chu-, rhabdo-, phlebo-, flavi- and parvo- viruses in Yunnan.

Therefore, there is a need to further improve the safety and efficacy of the current MuV vaccine. In the present study, we further attenuated MuV S79 vaccine strain by inhibiting viral mRNA methyltransferase (MTase). We generated a panel of eight recombinant MuVs (rMuVs) carrying mutations in the MTase catalytic site or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the large (L) polymerase protein. These rMuVs are genetically stable and seven rMuVs are more attenuated in replication in cell culture and five rMuVs are more attenuated in replication in lungs of cotton rats compared with the parental vaccine strain S79. Importantly, cotton rats vaccinated with these seven rMuV mutants produced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies and were completely protected against challenge with a wild-type MuV strain (genotype F).

In this study, we identified the role of SOX5 in KS tissues and KSHV-infected cells and elucidated the molecular mechanism. Thirty-two KS patients were enrolled in this study. Measurement of SOX5 mRNA and protein levels in human KS tissues and adjacent control tissues revealed lower levels in KS tissues, with KS patients having higher SOX5 level in the early stages of the disease compared to the later stages. And SOX5 mRNA and protein was also lower in KSHV-infected cells (iSLK-219 and iSLK-BAC) than normal cells (iSLK-Puro). Additionally, SOX5 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis and decreased KSHV-infected cell migration and invasion.

P connects nucleocapsid protein (N) with L to initiate genome transcription and replication. Sumoylation influences many important pathways of the target proteins, and many viral proteins are also themselves sumoylated. In this study, we found that the P of HPIV3 could be sumoylated, and mutation of K492 and K532 to arginine (PK492R\/K532R) failed to be sumoylated within P, which enhances HPIV3 minigenome activity. Biochemical studies showed that PK492R\/K532R had no effect on its interactions with N, formation of homo-tetramers and formation of inclusion bodies. Finally, we found that incorporation of K492R\/K532R into a recombinant HPIV3 (rHPIV3-PK492R\/K532R) increased viral production in culture cells, suggesting that sumoylation attenuates functions of P and down-regulates viral replication.","192":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks human immune system and causes life-threatening acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) could inhibit virus growth and slow progression of the disease, however, at the same time posing various adverse effects. Host ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) plays important roles in host immunity against pathogens including viruses by inducing degradation of viral proteins. Previously a series of methods for retargeting substrates for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation have been successfully established. In this study, we attempted to design and construct artificial chimeric ubiquitin ligases (E3s) based on known human E3s in order to manually target HIV-1 integrase for ubiquitin proteasome pathway-mediated degradation. Herein, a series of prototypical chimeric E3s have been designed and constructed, and original substrate-binding domains of these E3s were replaced with host protein domains which interacted with viral proteins. After functional assessment screening, 146LI was identified as a functional chimeric E3 for HIV-1 NL4-3 integrase. 146LI was then further optimized to generate 146LIS (146LI short) which has been shown to induce Lys48-specific polyubiquitination and reduce protein level of HIV-1 NL4-3 integrase more effectively in cells. Lymphocyte cells with 146LIS knock-in generated by CRISPR\/Cas-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) showed remarkably decreased integration of HIV-1 NL4-3 viral DNAs and reduced viral replication without obvious cell cytotoxicity.

Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality.

Our previous study has shown that human virus receptor proteins have some unique features including high N-glycosylation level, high number of interaction partners and high expression level. Here, a random-forest model was built to identify human virus receptorome from human cell membrane proteins with an accepted accuracy based on the combination of the unique features of human virus receptors and protein sequences. A total of 1424 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome of the human-infecting virome. In addition, the combination of the random-forest model with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies enabled further prediction of the receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses, such as the enterovirus, norovirus and West Nile virus. Finally, the candidate alternative receptors of the SARS-CoV-2 were also predicted in this study. As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to predict the receptorome for the human-infecting virome and would greatly facilitate the identification of the receptors for viruses.","241":"Enteroviruses (EVs) species A are a major public health issue in the Asia-Pacific region and cause frequent epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in China. Mild infections are common in children; however, HFMD can also cause severe illness that affects the central nervous system. To molecularly characterize EVs, a prospective HFMD virological surveillance program was performed in China between 2013 and 2016. Throat swabs, rectal swabs and stool samples were collected from suspected HFMD patients at participating hospitals. EVs were detected using generic real-time and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs). Then, the complete VP1 regions of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and CVA6 were sequenced to analyze amino acid changes and construct a viral molecular phylogeny. Of the 2836 enrolled HFMD patients, 2,517 (89%) were EV positive. The most frequently detected EVs were CVA16 (32.5%, 819), CVA6 (31.2%, 785), and EV-A71 (20.4%, 514). The subgenogroups CVA16_B1b, CVA6_D3a and EV-A71_C4a were predominant in China and recombination was not observed in the VP1 region. Sequence analysis revealed amino acid variations at the 30, 29 and 44 positions in the VP1 region of EV-A71, CVA16 and CVA6 (compared to the respective prototype strains BrCr, G10 and Gdula), respectively. Furthermore, in 21 of 24 (87.5%) identified EV-A71 samples, a known amino acid substitution (D31N) that may enhance neurovirulence was detected. Our study provides insights about the genetic characteristics of common HFMD-associated EVs.

Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) and protein S (Pros1) are the two ligands that activate TAM receptors. Recently, TAM receptors have been reported to mediate cell entry and infection of multitudinous enveloped viruses in a manner called apoptotic mimicry. Moreover, TAM receptors are revitalized during viral entry and infection, which sequesters innate immune and inflammatory responses, facilitating viral replication and immune evasion. However, accumulating evidence have now proposed that TAM receptors are not required for the infection of these viruses in vivo. In addition, TAM receptors protect mice against the CNS infection of neuroinvasive viruses and relieve the brain lesions during encephalitis. These protective effects are achieved through maintaining BBB integrity, attenuating proinflammatory cytokine production, and promoting neural cell survival. TAM receptors also regulate the programmed cell death modes of virus-infected cells, which have profound impacts on the pathogenesis and outcome of infection. Here, we systematically review the functionalities and underlying mechanisms of TAM receptors and propose the potential application of TAM agonists to prevent severe viral encephalitis.","244":null,"245":null,"246":null,"247":"","248":"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the etiological pathogens leading to hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which can cause severe neurological complications.

However, whether TDP-43 was impacted by EV-A71 infection is unknown. This study demonstrated that TDP-43 was cleaved during EV-A71 infection. The cleavage of TDP-43 requires EV-A71 replication rather than the activated caspases due to viral infection. TDP-43 is cleaved by viral protease 3C between the residues 331Q and 332S, while mutated TDP-43 (Q331A) was not cleaved. In addition, mutated 3C which lacks the protease activity failed to induce TDP-43 cleavage. We also found that TDP-43 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the mislocalization of TDP-43 was induced by viral protease 2A rather than 3C.

In this retrospective study, 339 pig serum samples were collected from 20 different commercial swine farms located in nine cities in Guangdong Province, China, from 2016 to 2018, to investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of PPgV in this geographical region. PPgV was detected in 55% (11\/20) of the farms using nested reverse transcription PCR, with 6.2% (21\/339) of pigs testing positive for PPgV. The yearly PPgV-positive rate increased from 2.6% to 7.5% between 2016 and 2018.

Inhibition of these viruses occurs at poorly-defined steps after viral entry and has a common requirement for MxB oligomerization. However, the GTPase activity is essential for the anti-viral effects of MxB against herpesviruses and HBV but not HIV-1. To understand the role of MxB GTPase activity, including GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis, in restriction of HIV-1 infection, we genetically separated these two functions and evaluated their contributions to restriction. We found that both the GTP binding and hydrolysis function of MxB involved in the restriction of HIV-1 replication. The GTPase activity of MxB contributed to its nuclear location, interaction with nucleoporins (NUPs) and HIV-1 capsids. Furthermore, MxB disrupted the association between NUPs and HIV-1 cores dependently upon its GTPase activity. The function of GTPase activity was therefore multi-faceted, led to fundamentally distinct mechanisms employed by wild-type MxB and GTPase activity defective MxB mutations to restrict HIV-1 replication.","257":"","258":"","259":null,"260":"","261":"Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from mosquitoes such as Aedes, Mansonia uniformis, and Culex perfuscus; However, the isolation of ZIKV from Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus has not yet been reported.

The hexon protein contains the main neutralizing epitopes, provoking strong and lasting immunogenicity. In this study, a novel recombinant and attenuated adenovirus vaccine candidate against HAdV-3 was constructed based on a commercially-available replication-defective HAdV-5 gene therapy and vaccine vector. The entire HAdV-3 hexon gene was integrated into the E1 region of the vector by homologous recombination using a bacterial system. The resultant recombinants expressing the HAdV-3 hexon protein were rescued in AD293 cells, identified and characterized by RT-PCR, Western blots, indirect immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. This potential vaccine candidate had a similar replicative efficacy as the wild-type HAdV-3 strain. However, and importantly, the vaccine strain had been rendered replication-defective and was incapable of replication in A549 cells after more than twenty-generation passages in AD293 cells. This represents a significant safety feature. The mice immunized both intranasally and intramuscularly by this vaccine candidate raised significant neutralizing antibodies against HAdV-3. Therefore, this recombinant, attenuated, and safe adenovirus vaccine is a promising HAdV-3 vaccine candidate.

When transfecting the EV71-G2A genome encoding plasmid in cells, the loss of myristoylation on VP4 did not affect the expression of viral proteins and the virus morphology, however, it did significantly influence viral infectivity. Further, in myristoylation-deficient reporter pseudovirus-infected cells, the luciferase activity and viral genome RNA decreased significantly as compared to that of wild type virus; however, cytopathic effect and viral capsid proteins were not detected in myristoylation-deficient virus-infected cells. Also, although myristoylation-deficient viral RNA and proteins were detected in the second blind passage of infection, they were much fewer in number compared to that of the wild type virus. The replication of genomic RNA and negative-strand viral RNA were both blocked in myristoylation-deficient viruses, suggesting that myristoylation affects viral genome RNA release from capsid to cytoplasm. Besides, loss of myristoylation on VP4 altered the distribution of VP4-green fluorescent protein protein, which disappeared from the membrane structure fraction. Finally, a liposome leakage assay showed that EV71 myristoylation mediates the permeability of the model membrane.

It is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded RNA genome with positive sense (8280 nucleotides) and a poly (A) chain. AiV was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions.

Although AiV is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent. The low percentage of AiV detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections.

In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo biofilm treatment models with single bacteriophages or phage cocktails have been compared. A combined use of bacteriophages with antibiotics in vitro or in vivo confirms earlier reports of the synergistic effect of these agents in improving biofilm removal. Furthermore, studies on the application of phage-derived lysins in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo against biofilm-related infections are encouraging. The strategy of combined use of phage and antibiotics seems to be different from using lysins and antibiotics. These findings suggest that phages and lysins alone or in combination with antibiotics may be an efficient weapon against biofilm formation in vivo and ex vivo, which could be useful in formulating novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Those findings proved to be relevant in the prevention and destruction of biofilms occurring during urinary tract infections, orthopedic implant-related infections, periodontal and peri-implant infections.

To understand the molecular mechanism of how aquareovirus initiates productive infection, the roles of endosome and microtubule in cell entry of GCRV are investigated by using quantum dots (QDs)-tracking in combination with biochemical approaches. We found that GCRV infection and viral protein synthesis were significantly inhibited by pretreating host cells with endosome acidification inhibitors NH4Cl, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 (Bafi). Confocal images indicated that GCRV particles could colocalize with Rab5, Rab7 and lysosomes in host cells. Further ultrastructural examination validated that viral particle was found in late endosomes. Moreover, disruption of microtubules with nocodazole clearly blocked GCRV entry, while no inhibitory effects were observed with cytochalasin D treated cells in viral infection, hinting that intracellular transportation of endocytic uptake in GCRV infected cells is via microtubules but not actin filament. Notably, viral particles were observed to transport along microtubules by using QD-labeled GCRV. Altogether, our results suggest that GCRV can use endosomes and microtubules to initiate productive infection.","327":"Vectored vaccines based on highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) are reported to be immunogenic, tolerant to pre-existing immunity, and able to accommodate and stably maintain very large transgenes. MVA is usually produced on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts, but production processes based on continuous cell lines emerge as increasingly robust and cost-effective alternatives. An isolate of a hitherto undescribed genotype was recovered by passage of a non-plaque-purified preparation of MVA in a continuous anatine suspension cell line (CR.pIX) in chemically defined medium. The novel isolate (MVA-CR19) replicated to higher infectious titers in the extracellular volume of suspension cultures and induced fewer syncytia in adherent cultures. We now extend previous studies with the investigation of the point mutations in structural genes of MVA-CR19 and describe an additional point mutation in a regulatory gene. We furthermore map and discuss an extensive rearrangement of the left telomer of MVA-CR19 that appears to have occurred by duplication of the right telomer. This event caused deletions and duplications of genes that may modulate immunologic properties of MVA-CR19 as a vaccine vector. Our characterizations also highlight the exceptional genetic stability of plaque-purified MVA: although the phenotype of MVA-CR19 appears to be advantageous for replication, we found that all genetic markers that differentiate wildtype and MVA-CR19 are stably maintained in passages of recombinant viruses based on either wildtype or MVA-CR.","328":"HIV-1 Rev is an accessory protein that plays a key role in nuclear exportation, stabilization, and translation of the viral mRNAs. Rev of HIV-1 clade BC often shows a truncation of 16 AAs due to a premature stop codon at residue 101. This stop codon presents the highest frequency in clade BC and the lowest frequency in clade B. In order to discover the potential biological effect of this truncation on Rev activity and virus replication of clade BC, we constructed Rev expression vectors of clade BC with or without 16 AAs within C-terminal separately, and replaced the stop codon by Q in a CRF07_BC infectious clone. We found that 16 AAs truncation had no effect on expression and activity of Rev in clade BC. Also, the mutation from the stop codon to Q had no effect on virus replication of clade BC. Next, to investigate the effect of this truncation on Rev activity and replication capacity of clade B, Rev expression vectors of clade B carrying or lacking 16 AAs in C-terminal were constructed respectively, and residue Q at position 101 within Rev was substituted by the stop codon in a clade B infectious clone. It was found that 16 AAs truncation significantly down-regulated Rev expression and impaired clade B Rev activity. Furthermore, a Q-to-stop codon substitution within Rev significantly reduced viral replication fitness of clade B. These results indicate that the premature stop codon at residue 101 within Rev exerts diverse impact on viral replication among different HIV-1 clades.","329":"","330":"Since 2012, the clinical cases of inclusion body hepatitis showed an increasing trend in China, causing considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. In this study, a fowl adenovirus strain CH\/GDLZ\/201801 was isolated from a chicken flock experiencing inclusion body hepatitis and analyzed by complete genome sequencing. The pathogenicity of the new virus strain was examined by experimental infection of specific pathogen free chickens. The isolate was identified by immunofluorescence and the virions presented typical icosahedral particles under transmission electron microscopy. The full genome of the isolate was 44,329 nucleotides in length with 58% G+C content. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the whole genome, revealed that the new isolate was closest to serotype 8a from the species Fowl aviadenovirus E (FAdV-E). Recombination analysis and phylogenetic analysis showed that the new isolate is a recombinant strain between FAdV-8a and FAdV-8b. In infection experiments, three infected chickens showed clinical signs and one chicken died on day 7 post infection, corresponding to 5% mortality. Macroscopic and microscopic lesions in the liver were observed, and viral antigen could be detected in the livers by immunohistochemical staining and TEM. Taken together, our study describes the genomic characteristics and pathogenicity of a FAdV-8a strain in China. It would lay a solid foundation for further study of the pathogenic mechanism and vaccine development of the virus.","331":"Viruses evolve rapidly and continuously threaten animal health and economy, posing a great demand for rapid and efficient genome editing technologies to study virulence mechanism and develop effective vaccine. We present a highly efficient viral genome manipulation method using CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase. We cloned pseudorabies virus genome into bacterial artificial chromosome, and used CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase to directly convert cytidine (C) to uridine (U) to induce premature stop mutagenesis in viral genes. The editing efficiencies were 100%. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that a large number of editable sites exist in pseudorabies virus (PRV) genomes. Notably, in our study viral genome exists as a plasmid in E. coli, suggesting that this method is virus species-independent. This application of base-editing provided an alternative approach to generate mutant virus and might accelerate study on virulence and vaccine development.","332":null,"333":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in regulating many biological processes. However, their roles in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in H3N2-infected cells and mock-infected cells by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 6129 lncRNAs and 50,031 mRNA transcripts in A549 cells displayed differential expression after H3N2 infection compared with mock infection. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, 4963 were upregulated, and 1166 were downregulated. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases (KEGG) suggested that target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in some biological processes, such as cellular metabolism and autophagy. The up- or downregulated lncRNAs were selected and further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a comparative expression analysis of lncRNAs in A549 cells infected with H3N2. Our results support the need for further analyses of the functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs during H3N2 infection.","334":null,"335":"RNAi interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism and has been well recognized as an important antiviral immunity in eukaryotes. Numerous viruses have been shown to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a medically important human pathogen that causes acute and chronic hepatitis. In this study, we screened all the nonstructural proteins of HCV and found that HCV NS2 could suppress RNAi induced either by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that NS2 could suppress RNAi via its direct interaction with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and siRNAs, and further identified that the cysteine 184 of NS2 is required for the RNAi suppression activity through a serial of point mutation analyses. Together, our findings uncovered that HCV NS2 can act as a VSR in vitro, thereby providing novel insights into the life cycle and virus-host interactions of HCV.","336":"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health concern in China. The most predominant enteroviruses that cause HFMD have traditionally been attributed to enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Since its first large outbreak in 2008, the dominant HFMD pathogens are constantly changing. In 2013 and 2015, CVA6 exceeded both EVA71 and CVA16 to become the leading cause of HFMD in some provinces. However, there still lacks a comprehensive overview on the molecular epidemiology and evolution of HFMD-related enteroviruses at the national level. In this study, we performed systematic epidemiological analyses of HFMD-related enteroviruses using the data of 64 published papers that met the inclusion criteria, and conducted phylogenetic analyses based on 12,080 partial VP1 sequences identified in China before 31st June 2018. We found that EVA71 prevalence has decreased sharply but other enteroviruses have increased rapidly from 2008 to 2016 and that one subtype of each enterovirus is represented during the epidemic. In addition, four genotypes EVA71_C4, CVA16_B1, CVA6_D and CVA10_C are the most predominant enterovirus strains and collectively they cause over 90% of all HFMD cases in China according to the phylogenetic trees using representative partial VP1 sequences. These four major enterovirus genotypes have different geographical distributions, and they may co-circulate with other genotypes and serotypes. These results suggest that more molecular epidemiological studies should be performed on several enteroviruses simultaneously, and such information should have implications for virological surveillance, disease management, vaccine development and policy-making on the prevention and control of HFMD.","337":"","338":null,"339":"Prototype foamy virus (PFV) is a unique retrovirus that infects animals and humans and does not cause clinical symptoms. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are believed to exert multiple regulatory functions during viral infections. Previously, we utilized RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize and identify the lncRNA lnc-RP5-1086D14.3.1-1:1 (lnc-RP5), which is markedly decreased in PFV-infected cells. However, little is known about the function of lnc-RP5 during PFV infection. In this study, we identified lnc-RP5 as a regulator of the PFV transcriptional transactivator (Tas). Lnc-RP5 enhanced the activity of the PFV internal promoter (IP). The expression of PFV Tas was found to be promoted by lnc-RP5. Moreover, miR-129-5p was found to be involved in the lnc-RP5-mediated promotion of PFV IP activity, while the Notch1 protein suppressed the activity of PFV IP and the expression of Tas. Our results demonstrate that lnc-RP5 promotes the expression of PFV Tas through the miR-129-5p\/Notch1\/PFV IP axis. This work provides evidence that host lncRNAs can manipulate PFV replication by employing miRNAs and proteins during an early viral infection.","340":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever disease caused by SFTSV, a newly discovered phlebovirus that is named after the disease. Currently, no effective vaccines or drugs are available for use against SFTSV infection, as our understanding of the viral pathogenesis is limited. Bortezomib (PS-341), a dipeptide-boronic acid analog, is the first clinically approved proteasome inhibitor for use in humans. In this study, the antiviral efficacy of PS-341 against SFTSV infection was tested in human embryonic kidney HEK293T (293T) cells. We employed four different assays to analyze the antiviral ability of PS-341 and determined that PS-341 inhibited the proliferation of SFTSV in 293T cells under various treatment conditions. Although PS-341 did not affect the virus absorption, PS-341 treatment within a non-toxic concentration range resulted in a significant reduction of progeny viral titers in infected cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis revealed that PS-341 could reverse the SFTSV-encoded non-structural protein (NS) mediated degradation of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I), thereby antagonizing the inhibitory effect of NSs on interferons and blocking virus replication. In addition, we observed that inhibition of apoptosis promotes virus replication. These results indicate that targeting of cellular interferon pathways and apoptosis during acute infection might serve as the bases of future therapeutics for the treatment of SFTSV infections.","341":"","342":null,"343":null,"344":null,"345":null,"346":"Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is an infectious agent responsible for feather degeneration and beak deformation in birds. In March 2017, an epidemic of psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) struck a farm in Fuzhou in the Fujian Province of southeast China, resulting in the death of 51 parrots. In this study, the disease was diagnosed and the pathogen was identified by PCR and whole genome sequencing. A distinct BFDV strain was identified and named as the FZ strain. This BFDV strain caused severe disease symptoms and pathological changes characteristic of typical PBFD in parrots, for example, loss of feathers and deformities of the beak and claws, and severe pathological changes in multiple organs of the infected birds. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the FZ strain was more closely related to the strain circulating in New Caledonia than the strains previously reported in China. Nucleotide homology between the FZ strain and other 43 strains of BFDV ranged from 80.0% to 92.0%. Blind passage experiment showed that this strain had limited replication capability in SPF Chicken Embryos and DF-1 Cells. Furthermore, the capsid (Cap) gene of this FZ strain was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector to prepare the polyclonal anti-Cap antibody. Western blotting analysis using the anti-Cap antibody further confirmed that the diseased parrots were infected with BFDV. In this study, a PBFD and its pathogen was identified for the first time in Fujian Province of China, suggesting that future surveillance of BFDV should be performed.","347":"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) rapidly causes cytopathic effects in susceptible cells. Incomplete viral clearance during the acute infection leads to persistent infection. The relationship between host gene expression and the persistent infection remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of BHK-21 cells acutely and persistently infected with FMDV to identify differences in gene expression. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the 8,378 differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in categories including metabolism, biosynthesis, ribosome function, and endocytosis. In persistently infected BHK-21 cells, ribosome- and translation-related genes were significantly down-regulated. There were more differentially expressed immune-related genes during persistent infection than during acute infection. Two hundred and seventy-four genes were differentially expressed in both acutely and persistently infected BHK-21 cells. Among these genes, heat shock protein family B member 1 (Hspb1) knockdown significantly inhibited FMDV replication. Our research provides a basis for further research to understand the mechanisms of persistent FMDV infection including the genes involved in FMDV replication.","348":null,"349":null,"350":"","351":"While host proteins incorporated into virions during viral budding from infected cell are known to play essential roles in multiple process of the life cycle of progeny virus, these characteristics have been largely neglected in studies on rabies virus (RABV). Here, we purified the RABV virions with good purity and integrity, and analyzed their proteome by nano LC-MS\/MS, followed by the confirmation with immunoblot and immuno-electronic microscopy. In addition to the 5 viral proteins, 49 cellular proteins were reproducibly identified to be incorporated into matured RABV virions. Function annotation suggested that 24 of them were likely involved in virus replication. Furthermore, cryo-EM was employed to observe the purified RABV virions, generating high-resolution pictures of the bullet-shaped virion structure of RABV. This study has provided new insights into the host proteins composition in RABV virion and shed the light for further investigation on molecular mechanisms of RABV infection, as well as the discovery of new anti-RABV therapeutics.","352":"The roles of lncRNAs in the infection of enteroviruses have been barely demonstrated. In this study, we used coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a typical enterovirus, as a model to investigate the expression profiles and functional roles of lncRNAs in enterovirus infection. We profiled lncRNAs and mRNA expression in CVB3-infected HeLa cells by lncRNA-mRNA integrated microarrays. As a result, 700 differentially expressed lncRNAs (431 up-regulated and 269 down-regulated) and 665 differentially expressed mRNAs (299 up-regulated and 366 down-regulated) were identified in CVB3 infection. Then we performed lncRNA-mRNA integrated pathway analysis to identify potential functional impacts of the differentially expressed mRNAs, in which lncRNA-mRNA correlation network was built. According to lncRNA-mRNA correlation, we found that XLOC-001188, an lncRNA down-regulated in CVB3 infection, was negatively correlated with NFAT5 mRNA, an anti-CVB3 gene reported previously. This interaction was supported by qPCR detection following siRNA-mediated knockdown of XLOC-001188, which showed an increase of NFAT5 mRNA and a reduction of CVB3 genomic RNA. In addition, we observed that four most significantly altered lncRNAs, SNHG11, RP11-145F16.2, RP11-1023L17.1 and RP11-1021N1.2 share several common correlated genes critical for CVB3 infection, such as BRE and IRF2BP1. In all, our studies reveal the alteration of lncRNA expression in CVB3 infection and its potential influence on CVB3 replication, providing useful information for future studies of enterovirus infection.","353":null,"354":"","355":null,"356":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is characterized by its genetic variation and limited cross protection among heterologous strains. Even though several viral structural proteins have been regarded as inducers of neutralizing antibodies (NAs) against PRRSV, the mechanism underlying limited cross-neutralization among heterologous strains is still controversial. In the present study, examinations of NA cross reaction between a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain, JXwn06, and a low pathogenic PRRSV (LP-PRRSV) strain, HB-1\/3.9, were conducted with viral neutralization assays in MARC-145 cells. None of the JXwn06-hyperimmuned pigs' sera could neutralize HB-1\/3.9 in vitro and vice versa. To address the genetic variation between these two viruses that are associated with limited cross-neutralization, chimeric viruses with coding regions swapped between these two strains were constructed. Viral neutralization assays indicated that variations in nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) and structural proteins together contribute to weak cross-neutralization activity between JXwn06 and HB-1\/3.9. Furthermore, we substituted the nsp2-, glycoprotein2 (GP2)-, GP3-, and GP4-coding regions together, or nsp2-, GP5-, and membrane (M) protein-coding regions simultaneously between these two viruses to construct chimeric viruses to test cross-neutralization reactivity with hyperimmunized sera induced by their parental viruses. The results indicated that the swapped nsp2 and GP5-M viruses increased the neutralization reactivity with the donor strain antisera in MARC-145 cells. Taken together, these results show that variations in nsp2 and GP5-M correlate with the limited neutralization reactivity between the heterologous strains HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1\/3.9.","357":"Baculoviridae is a family of large DNA viruses that specifically infect insects. It contains four genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltabaculovirus. Alphabaculovirus is further divided into Group I and II, and Group I appears to be emerged most recently among all baculoviruses. Interestingly, there are 12 Group I specific genes that are only found in this lineage. Studying these genes is helpful to understand how baculoviruses evolved. Here, we reported the functional analyzing results of ac73, a function unknown Group I specific gene of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) which is the type species of baculovirus. The AC73 protein encoded by ac73 was found to be expressed during the late stage of infection and incorporated into the nucleocapsids of budded virus (BV) and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). In infected cells, AC73 resided mainly in the ring zone region of the nucleus, and appeared to be assembled into occlusion bodies (OBs). The ac73 knockout and repaired viruses were constructed and studied by in vitro and in vivo infection. Although ac73 was not essential for BV and ODV or OB formation, the BV titer and viral infectivity in insect larvae of ac73 knockout AcMNPV decreased by about 5-8 and 3-4 fold compared to those of wild type virus, respectively, suggesting ac73 contributed to infectious BV production and viral infectivity in vivo. This research provides new insight into the function of this Group I specific gene.","358":"Our previous study has shown that the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) p48 (ac103) gene is essential for the nuclear egress of nucleocapsids and the formation of occlusion-derived virions (ODVs). However, the exact role of p48 in the morphogenesis of ODVs remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that p48 was required for the efficient formation of intranuclear microvesicles. To further understand its functional role in intranuclear microvesicle formation, we characterized the distribution of the P48 protein, which was found to be associated with the nucleocapsid and envelope fractions of both budded virions and ODVs. In AcMNPV-infected cells, P48 was predominantly localized to nucleocapsids in the virogenic stroma and the nucleocapsids enveloped in ODVs, with a limited but discernible distribution in the plasma membrane, nuclear envelope, intranuclear microvesicles, and ODV envelope. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that among the viral proteins required for intranuclear microvesicle formation, P48 associated with Ac93 in the absence of viral infection.","359":"Severe influenza infections are often associated with the excessive induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is also referred to as \"cytokine storms\". Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenza-induced fatal acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the narrow administration window, current antiviral therapies are often inadequate. The efforts to use immunomodulatory agents alone or in combination with antiviral agents in the treatment of influenza in animal models have resulted in the achievement of protective effects accompanied with reduced cytokine production. Currently, there are no immunomodulatory drugs for influenza available for clinical use. Animal models, despite being ideal to study the anti-inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast and economical screening methods using cell-based models to screen and develop novel immunomodulatory agents. In this study, we screened seven human cell lines and found that the human monocytic cell U937 supports the replication of different subtypes of influenza viruses as well as the production of the important pro-inflammatory cytokines and was selected to develop the cell-based model. The U937 cell model was validated by testing a panel of known antiviral and immunomodulatory agents and screening a drug library consisting of 1280 compounds comprised mostly of FDA-approved drugs. We demonstrated that the U937 cell model is robust and suitable for the high-throughput screening of immunomodulators and antivirals against influenza infection.","360":"Since late 2011, outbreaks of pseudorabies virus (PRV) have occurred in southern China causing major economic losses to the pig industry. We previously reported that variant PRV forms and recombination in China could be the source of continued epidemics. Here, we analyzed samples from intensive pig farms in eastern China between 2017 and 2019, and sequenced the main glycoproteins (gB, gC, gD, and gE) to study the evolution characteristics of PRV. Based on the gC gene, we found that PRV variants belong to clade 2 and detected a founder effect during by the PRV epidemic. In addition, we detected inter- and intra-clade recombination; in particular, inter-clade recombination in the gB genes of strains FJ-ZXF and FJ-W2, which were recombinant with clade 1 strains. We also found specific amino-acid changes and positively selected sites, possibly associated with functional changes. This analysis of the emergence of PRV in China illustrates the need for continuous monitoring and the development of vaccines against specific variants of PRV.","361":null,"362":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a common public health problem in developing countries. However, the current prevalence of HEV and the relationship of HEV genotype between swine and human within high-density pig-farming areas in central China are still inadequately understood. Here, cross-sectional serological and genotypic surveys of HEV among the 1232 general population, 273 workers occupationally exposed to swine, and 276 pigs in a high-density pig-breeding area, were undertaken by ELISA and nested RT-PCR methods. Anti-HEV IgG was detected in 26.22% of general population and 48.35% of occupational workers. The prevalence of swine serum HEV-Ag was 6.52%. The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was significantly higher among the workers occupationally exposed to swine than among the general population. An increased HEV seropositivity risk among the general population was associated with either being a peasant or male and was very strongly associated with the increase of age. Among the occupationally exposed group, the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies increased with age and working years. Among the 30 HEV-IgM-positive people, the infection rates of clerks in the public, peasants, pork retailers, and pig farmers were higher than those of others. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the isolates belonged to subgenotype 4d, and four people and four pigs shared 97.04%-100% sequence homology. This study revealed a high HEV seroprevalence among the general population and workers occupationally exposed to swine in the Anlu City, and supports the notion that swine are a source of human HEV infection.","363":"Rabies is a zoonotic disease that still causes 59,000 human deaths each year, and rabies vaccine is the most effective way to control the disease. Our previous studies suggested that the maturation of DC plays an important role in enhancing the immunogenicity of rabies vaccine. Flt3L has been reported to own the ability to accelerate the DC maturation, therefore, in this study, a recombinant rabies virus expressing mouse Flt3L, designated as LBNSE-Flt3L, was constructed, and its immunogenicity was characterized. It was found that LBNSE-Flt3L could enhance the maturation of DC both in vitro and in vivo, and significantly more TFH cells and Germinal Center B (GC B) cells were generated in mice immunized with LBNSE-Flt3L than those immunized with the parent virus LBNSE. Consequently, expressing of Flt3L could elevate the level of virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA) in immunized mice which provides a better protection from a lethal rabies virus challenge. Taken together, our study extends the potential of Flt3L as a good adjuvant to develop novel rabies vaccine by enhancing the VNA production through activating the DC-TFH-GC B axis in immunized mice.","364":"Conventional influenza vaccines need to be designed and manufactured yearly. However, they occasionally provide poor protection owing to antigenic mismatch. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop universal vaccines against influenza virus. Using nucleoprotein (NP) and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) genes from the influenza A virus A\/Beijing\/30\/95 (H3N2), we constructed four recombinant vaccinia virus-based influenza vaccines carrying NP fused with one or four copies of M2e genes in different orders. The recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to immunize BALB\/C mice. Humoral and cellular responses were measured, and then the immunized mice were challenged with the influenza A virus A\/Puerto Rico\/8\/34 (PR8). NP-specific humoral response was elicited in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length NP, while robust M2e-specific humoral response was elicited only in the mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying multiple copies of M2e. All recombinant viruses elicited NP- and M2e-specific cellular immune responses in mice. Only immunization with RVJ-4M2eNP induced remarkably higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines specific to M2e. Furthermore, RVJ-4M2eNP immunization provided the highest cross-protection in mice challenged with 20 MLD50 of PR8. Therefore, the cross-protection potentially correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP, which expresses a fusion antigen of full-length NP preceded by four M2e repeats. These results suggest that the rational fusion of NP and multiple M2e antigens is critical toward inducing protective immune responses, and the 4M2eNP fusion antigen may be employed to develop a universal influenza vaccine.","365":"","366":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome phlebovirus (SFTSV) has a wide host range. Not only has it been found in humans, but also in many wild and domesticated animals. The infection of breeding deer on farms is a particularly worrisome public health concern due to the large amount of human contact and the diverse use of deer products, including raw blood. To investigate the prevalence of breeding domesticated deer, we examined the SFTSV infection rate on deer farms in South Korea from 2015 to 2017. Of the 215 collected blood samples, 0.9% (2\/215) were found to be positive for viral RNA by PCR, and sequence analysis showed the highest homology with the KADGH human isolate. Both SFTSV-specific recombinant N and Gn protein-based ELISAs revealed that 14.0% (30\/215) and 7.9% (17\/215) of collected blood specimens were positive for SFTSV antibody. These results demonstrate that the breeding farm deer are exposed to SFTSV and could be a potential infection source for humans through direct contact or consumption of byproducts.","367":"Early etiological diagnosis is very important for the control of sudden viral infections, and requires antibodies with both high sensitivity and high specificity. Traditional antibody preparation methods have limitations, such as a long and arduous cycle, complicated operation, and high expenses. A chicken lymphoma cell line, DT40, is known to produce IgM-type antibodies and undergo gene conversion and somatic mutation in the variable region of the immunoglobulin gene during culture. Here, the DT40 cell line was developed to produce antibody libraries and prepare antibody rapidly in vitro. Since hypermutation in DT40 cells was regulated by the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, AID expression needs to be controlled to either fix the Ig sequence by stopping mutation or improve affinity by resuming mutation after the antibodies have been selected. In this study, we generated a novel AID-inducible DT40 cell line (DT40-H7), in which the endogenous AID gene was knocked out using the CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing system, and an inducible AID gene, based on the Tet-Off expression system, was stably transfected. AID expression was controlled in DT40-H7 cells in a simple and efficient manner; gene conversion and point mutations were observed only when AID was expressed. Using the antibody library generated from this cell line, we successfully obtained monoclonal antibodies against the NS1 protein of Zika virus. The DT40-H7 cell line represents a useful tool for the selection and evolution of antibodies and may also be a powerful tool for the rapid selection and generation of diagnostic antibodies for emerging infectious diseases.","368":"Recently the developed single guide (sg)RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\/associated protein 9 nuclease (CRISPR\/Cas9) technology has opened a new avenue for antiviral therapy. The CRISPR\/Cas9 system uniquely allows targeting of multiple genome sites simultaneously. However, there are relatively few applications of CRISPR\/Cas9 multigene editing to target insect viruses. To address the need for sustained delivery of a multiplex CRISPR\/Cas9-based genome-editing vehicle against insect viruses, we developed a one-vector (pSL1180-Cas9-U6-sgRNA) system that expresses multiple sgRNA and Cas9 protein to excise Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) in insect cells. We screened the immediate-early-1 gene (ie-1), the major envelope glycoprotein gene (gp64), and the late expression factor gene (lef-11), and identified multiple sgRNA editing sites through flow cytometry and viral DNA replication analysis. In addition, we constructed a multiplex editing vector (PSL1180-Cas9-sgIE1-sgLEF11-sgGP64, sgMultiple) to efficiently regulate multiplex gene-editing and inhibit BmNPV replication after viral infection. This is the first report of the application of a multiplex CRISPR\/Cas9 system to inhibit insect virus replication.

The question was raised how the coexistence of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) resistance MTs and WT sequences affects HBV replication. In the present study, HBV genomes with frequently detected reverse transcriptase (RT)\/surface truncation MTs, rtA181T\/sW172*, rtV191I\/sW182* and rtM204I\/sW196*, were phenotypically characterized alone or together with their WT counterparts in different ratios by transient transfection in the absence or presence of NAs. In the absence of NAs, RT\/surface truncation MTs impaired the expression and secretion of HBV surface proteins, and had a dose-dependent negative effect on WT HBV virion secretion. However, in the presence of NAs, coexistence of MTs with WT maintained viral replication, and the presence of WT was able to rescue the production of MT HBV virions. Our findings reveal that complementation of WT and MT HBV genomes is highly effective under drug treatment.","370":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a highly pathogenic tick-borne bunyavirus that causes lethal infectious disease and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in humans. The molecular mechanisms and host cellular factors required for SFTSV infection remain uncharacterized. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-based screening strategy, we identified a host cellular protein, sorting nexin 11 (SNX11) which is involved in the intracellular endosomal trafficking pathway, as an essential cell factor for SFTSV infection. An SNX11-KO HeLa cell line was established, and SFTSV replication was significantly reduced. The glycoproteins of SFTSV were detected and remained in later endosomal compartments but were not detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi apparatus. pH values in the endosomal compartments of the SNX11-KO cells increased compared with the pH of normal HeLa cells, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) expression was significantly elevated in the SNX11-KO cells. Overall, these results indicated that penetration of SFTSV from the endolysosomes into the cytoplasm of host cells was blocked in the cells lacking SNX11. Our study for the first time provides insight into the important role of the SNX11 as an essential host factor in the intracellular trafficking and penetrating process of SFTSV infection via potential regulation of viral protein sorting, membrane fusion, and other endocytic machinery.","371":"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral encephalitis disease caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Uncontrolled inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) are a hallmark of severe JE. Although the CCR2-CCL2 axis is important for monocytes trafficking during JEV infection, little is known about its role in CNS trafficking of CD8+ T cells. Here, we characterized a mouse model of JEV infection, induced via intravenous injection (i.v.) and delineated the chemokines and infiltrating peripheral immune cells in the brains of infected mice. The CNS expression of chemokines, Ccl2, Ccl3, and Ccl5, and their receptors, Ccr2 or Ccr5, was significantly up-regulated after JEV infection and was associated with the degree of JE pathogenesis. Moreover, JEV infection resulted in the migration of a large number of CD8+ T cells into the CNS. In the brains of JEV-infected mice, infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed CCR2 and CCR5 and were found to comprise mainly effector T cells (CD44+CD62L-). JEV infection dramatically enhanced the expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the brain, as compared to that on peripheral CD8+ T cells in the spleen. This effect was more pronounced on infiltrating CCR2+CD8+ T cells than on CCR2-CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, we identified a new subset of CD8+ T cells (PD1+CCR2+CD8+ T cells) present in the CNS of mice during acute JEV infection. These CD8+ T cells might play a role in JE pathogenesis.","372":"Chikungunya fever is a vector-borne viral disease transmitted to humans by chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected mosquitoes. There have been many outbreaks of CHIKV infection worldwide, and the virus poses ongoing risks to global health. To prevent and control CHIKV infection, it is important to improve the current CHIKV diagnostic approaches to allow for the detection of low CHIKV concentrations and to correctly distinguish CHIKV infections from those due to other mosquito-transmitted viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the CHIKV envelope 2 protein (CHIKV-E2) and compared their sensitivity and specificity with commercially available mAbs using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Two anti-CHIKV-E2 mAbs, 19-1 and 21-1, showed higher binding affinities to CHIKV-E2 protein than the commercial mAbs did. In particular, the 19-1 mAb had the strongest binding affinity to inactivated CHIKV. Moreover, the 19-1 mAb had very little cross-reactivity with other mosquito-borne viruses, such as ZIKV, JEV, and DENV. These results suggest that the newly produced anti-CHIKV-E2 mAb, 19-1, could be used for CHIKV diagnostic approaches.","373":"Baculovirus can transduce a wide range of mammalian cells and is considered a promising gene therapy vector. However, the low transduction efficiency of baculovirus into many mammalian cells limits its practical application. Co-expressing heterologous viral glycoproteins (GPs), such as vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G), with baculovirus native envelope protein GP64 is one of the feasible strategies for improving virus transduction. Tick-borne thogotoviruses infect mammals and their GPs share sequence\/structure homology and common evolutionary origins with baculovirus GP64. Herein, we tested whether thogotovirus GPs could facilitate the entry of the prototype baculovirus Autographa californica multiple multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) into mammalian cells. The gp genes of two thogotoviruses, Thogoto virus and Dhori virus, were inserted into the AcMNPV genome. Both GPs were properly expressed and incorporated into the envelope of the recombinant AcMNPVs. The transduction rates of recombinant AcMNPVs expressing the two thogotovirus GPs increased for approximately 4-12 fold compared to the wild type AcMNPV in six of the 12 tested mammalian cell lines. It seemed that thogotovirus GPs provide the recombinant AcMNPVs with different cell tropisms and showed better performance in several mammalian cells compared to VSV G incorporated AcMNPV. Further studies showed that the improved transduction was a result of augmented virus-endosome fusion and endosome escaping, rather than increased cell binding or internalization. We found the AcMNPV envelope protein GP64-mediated fusion was enhanced by the thogotovirus GPs at relatively higher pH conditions. Therefore, the thogotovirus GPs represent novel candidates to improve baculovirus-based gene delivery vectors.","374":"HIV-indeterminate Western blotting (WB) results are typically obtained in WB confirmatory assays, and the number of indeterminate samples may increase with the detection of HIV infections, which will present considerable challenges for the management of HIV\/AIDS. Nucleic acid detection has been used as a laboratory test for screening suspected or indeterminate samples. However, the effectiveness of these assays for the differential diagnosis of HIV-indeterminate WB samples remained undetermined. In this study, 210 subjects with HIV-indeterminate WB results were detected from 6360 positive HIV screening samples between 2015 and 2016 in southeastern China, in which HIV-indeterminate WB results accounted for 3.30%. The highest proportion of indeterminate results was observed in pregnant and lying-in women receiving physical examinations (16.67%), followed by that in voluntary blood donors (8.82%). The most common WB band patterns were p24, gp160 and p24, and gp160. The follow-up study revealed that the highest negative and positive conversion rates of HIV antibodies were in samples with a single p24 band (80.28%), and with gp160 and p24 bands (86.21%), respectively. Among the Env, Gag, and Pol antibodies, samples with a Gag band showed the highest negative conversion rate (81.25%), whereas the highest positive conversion rate was observed in samples with an Env band (56.76%). In addition, quantitative and qualitative HIV nucleic acid testing exhibited the highest sensitivity (96.3%) and specificity (97.85%), respectively. Our results indicate a lower proportion of HIV indeterminate WB results in southeastern China compared to previous reports, and the follow-up re-examination of patients with HIV indeterminate results should be performed. Nucleic acid testing facilitates the identification of HIV infections.","375":null,"376":"The phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PLA1A) is an essential host factor in hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly. In this study, we mapped the E2, NS2 and NS5A involved in PLA1A interaction to their lumenal domains and membranous parts, through which they form oligomeric protein complexes to participate in HCV assembly. Multiple regions of PLA1A were involved in their interaction and complex formation. Furthermore, the results represented structures with PLA1A and E2 in closer proximity than NS2 and NS5A, and strongly suggest PLA1A-E2's physical interaction in cells. Meanwhile, we mapped the NS5A sequence which participated in PLA1A interaction with the C-terminus of domain 1. Interestingly, these amino acids in the sequence are also essential for viral RNA replication. Further experiments revealed that these four proteins interact with each other. Moreover, PLA1A expression levels were elevated in livers from HCV-infected patients. In conclusion, we exposed the structural determinants of PLA1A, E2, NS2 and NS5A proteins which were important for HCV assembly and provided a detailed characterization of PLA1A in HCV assembly.","377":"","378":null,"379":"","380":"","381":"","382":null,"383":"Acinetobacter baumannii causes serious infections especially in immunocompromised and\/or hospitalized patients.

Phage therapy is a promising means to fight this bacterium and many studies on procuring and applying new phages against A. baumannii are currently being conducted. As shown in animal models, phages against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii may control bacterial infections caused by this pathogen and may be a real hope to solve this dangerous health problem.","384":"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and it also causes severe neurologic complications in infected children. The interactions between some viruses and the host mitochondria are crucial for virus replication and pathogenicity. In this study, it was observed that EV-A71 infection resulted in a perinuclear redistribution of the mitochondria. The mitochondria rearrangement was found to require the microtubule network, the dynein complex and a low cytosolic calcium concentration. Subsequently, the EV-A71 non-structural protein 2BC was identified as the viral protein capable of inducing mitochondria clustering. The protein was found localized on mitochondria and interacted with the mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1 (RHOT1) that is a key protein required for attachment between the mitochondria and the motor proteins, which are responsible for the control of mitochondria movement. Additionally, suppressing mitochondria clustering by treating cells with nocodazole, EHNA, thapsigargin or A23187 consistently inhibited EV-A71 replication, indicating that mitochondria recruitment played a crucial role in the EV-A71 life cycle. This study identified a novel function of the EV-A71 2BC protein and provided a potential model for the regulation of mitochondrial motility in EV-A71 infection.","385":"RNA granules are cytoplasmic, microscopically visible, non-membrane ribo-nucleoprotein structures and are important posttranscriptional regulators in gene expression by controlling RNA translation and stability. TIA\/G3BP\/PABP-specific stress granules (SG) and GW182\/DCP-specific RNA processing bodies (PB) are two major distinguishable RNA granules in somatic cells and contain various ribosomal subunits, translation factors, scaffold proteins, RNA-binding proteins, RNA decay enzymes and helicases to exclude mRNAs from the cellular active translational pool. Although SG formation is inducible due to cellular stress, PB exist physiologically in every cell. Both RNA granules are important components of the host antiviral defense. Virus infection imposes stress on host cells and thus induces SG formation. However, both RNA and DNA viruses must confront the hostile environment of host innate immunity and apply various strategies to block the formation of SG and PB for their effective infection and multiplication. This review summarizes the current research development in the field and the mechanisms of how individual viruses suppress the formation of host SG and PB for virus production.","386":"As specific pathogens of noctuid pests, including Spodoptera exigua, S. litura, Helicoverpa armigera, and Mythimna separata, ascoviruses are suitable for the development of bioinsecticides. In this study, the infectivity of Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3j (HvAV-3j) on insect and mammalian cells was evaluated. HvAV-3j infection induced drastic morphological changes in Sf9, HzAM1, SeFB, and HaFB cells, including swelling and detachment. Notably, the latter phenomena did not occur in HvAV-3j-inoculated mammalian cells (HEK293, 7402, HePG2, PK15, ST, and TM3). MTT assays indicated that HvAV-3j inhibited the growth of host insect cells from the 6th hpi, but no effects were detected in the HvAV-3j-inoculated mammalian cells. Furthermore, viral DNA replication, gene transcription, and protein expression were investigated, and the results consistently suggested that HvAV-3j viruses were not able to replicate their genomic DNA, transcribe, or express their proteins in the non-target vertebrate cells. The HvAV-3j genes were only transcribed and expressed in the four insect cell lines. These results indicated that HvAV-3j was infectious to cells derived from S. frugiperda, S. exigua, H. armigera, and H. zea but not to cells derived from human, pig, and mouse, suggesting that ascoviruses are safe to non-target vertebrate cells.","387":"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 capsid (HIV-1 CA) is involved in different stages of the viral replication cycle. During virion assembly, CA drives the formation of the hexameric lattice in immature viral particles, while in mature virions CA monomers assemble in cone-shaped cores surrounding the viral RNA genome and associated proteins. In addition to its functions in late stages of the viral replication cycle, CA plays key roles in a number of processes during early phases of HIV-1 infection including trafficking, uncoating, recognition by host cellular proteins and nuclear import of the viral pre-integration complex. As a result of efficient cooperation of CA with other viral and cellular proteins, integration of the viral genetic material into the host genome, which is an essential step for productive viral infection, successfully occurs. In this review, we will summarize available data on CA functions in HIV-1 replication, describing in detail its roles in late and early phases of the viral replication cycle.","388":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), is etiologically linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. These malignancies often occur in immunosuppressed individuals, making KSHV infection-associated diseases an increasing global health concern with persistence of the AIDS epidemic. KSHV exhibits biphasic life cycles between latent and lytic infection and extensive transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. As a member of the herpesvirus family, KSHV has evolved many strategies to evade the host immune response, which help the virus establish a successful lifelong infection. In this review, we summarize the current research status on the biology of latent and lytic viral infection, the regulation of viral life cycles and the related pathogenesis.","389":"To date, 29 distinct microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be expressed during herpes simplex virus infections. Sequence analysis of mature herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) miRNAs revealed five sets of miRNAs that are complementary to each other: miR-H6-5p\/H1-3p, miR-H6-3p\/H1-5p, H2-5p\/H14-3p, miR-H2-3p\/H14-5p, and miR-H7\/H27. However, the roles of individual miRNAs and consequences of this complementarity remain unclear. Here, we focus on two of these complementary miRNAs, miR-H6-5p and miR-H1-3p, using loss-of-function experiments in vitro and in a mouse model of infection using an miRNA sponge approach, including tandem multiplex artificial miRNA-binding sequences that do not match perfectly to the target miRNA inserted downstream of a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Infection with recombinant virus expressing the miR-H6-5p sponge reduced viral protein levels and virus yield. Decreased accumulation of viral proteins was also observed at early stages of infection in the presence of both an miR-H6-5p inhibitor and plasmid-expressed miR-H1-3p. Moreover, establishment of latency and reactivation did not differ between the recombinant virus expressing the miR-H6-5p sponge and wild-type HSV-1. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-H6-5p has an as-yet-unidentified role in the early stages of viral infection, and its complement miR-H1-3p suppresses this role in later stages of infection. This report extends understanding of the roles of miRNAs in infection by herpes simplex viruses, supporting a model of infection in which the production of virus and its virulent effects are tightly controlled to maximize persistence in the host and population.","390":"Previous studies have indicated that two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; A1-10 and H1-84) of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen on the H1N1 influenza virus cross-react with human brain tissue. It has been proposed that there are heterophilic epitopes between the HA protein and human brain tissue (Guo et al. in Immunobiology 220:941-946, 2015). However, characterisation of the two mAbs recognising the heterophilic epitope on HA has not yet been performed. In the present study, the common antigens of influenza virus HA were confirmed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and analysed with DNAMAN software. The epitopes were localized to nine peptides in the influenza virus HA sequence and the distribution of the peptides in the three-dimensional structure of HA was determined using PyMOL software. Key amino acids and variable sequences of the antibodies were identified using abYsis software. The results demonstrated that there were a number of common antigens among the five influenza viruses studied that were recognised by the mAbs. One of the peptides, P2 (LVLWGIHHP191-199), bound both of the mAbs and was located in the head region of HA. The key amino acids of this epitope and the variable regions in the heavy and light chain sequences of the mAbs that recognised the epitope are described. A heterophilic epitope on H1N1 influenza virus HA was also introduced. The existence of this epitope provides a novel perspective for the occurrence of nervous system diseases that could be caused by influenza virus infection, which might aid in influenza prevention and control.","391":"As we know more about Zika virus (ZIKV), as well as its linkage to birth defects (microcephaly) and autoimmune neurological syndromes, we realize the importance of developing an efficient vaccine against it. Zika virus disease has affected many countries and is becoming a major public health concern. To deal with the infection of ZIKV, plenty of experiments have been done on selection of neutralizing antibodies that can target the envelope (E) protein on the surface of the virion. However, the existence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect might limit the use of them as therapeutic candidates. In this review, we classify the neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV based on the epitopes and summarize the resolved structural information on antibody\/antigen complex from X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which might be useful for further development of potent neutralizing antibodies and vaccines toward clinical use.","392":null,"393":"","394":"Our previous work has shown that Saffold virus (SAFV) induced several rodent and primate cell lines to undergo apoptosis (Xu et al. in Emerg Microb Infect 3:1-8, 2014), but the essential viral proteins of SAFV involved in apoptotic activity lack study. In this study, we individually transfected the viral proteins of SAFV into HEp-2 and Vero cells to assess their ability to induce apoptosis, and found that the 2B and 3C proteins are proapoptotic. Further investigation indicated the transmembrane domain of the 2B protein is essential for the apoptotic activity and tetramer formation of the 2B protein. Our research provides clues for the possible mechanisms of apoptosis induced by SAFV in different cell lines. It also opens up new directions to study viral proteins (the 2B, 3C protein), and sets the stage for future exploration of any possible link between SAFV, inclusive of its related uncultivable genotypes, and multiple sclerosis.","395":null,"396":"As a universal pathogen leading to neonatal defects and transplant failure, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has strict species specificity and this has prevented the development of a suitable animal model for the pathogenesis study. The mechanism of cross-species barrier remains elusive and there are so far no non-human cell culture models that support HCMV replication. The Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) is a small laboratory animal and evolutionary closely related with primates. We investigated the susceptibility of primary tree shrew dermis fibroblasts (TSDF) to HCMV infection. Infection with a GFP-expressing HCMV virus resulted in green fluorescence in infected cells with the expression of IE1, UL44 and pp28. The titers of cell-free viruses reached 103 PFU\/mL at 96 hpi, compared to titers of 104 PFU\/mL observed in primary human foreskin fibroblasts. Our results suggested that TSDF was semi-permissive for HCMV infection. The TSDF model could be further used to investigate key factors influencing cross-species multiplication of HCMV.","397":"Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins were shown to play an important role in innate antiviral immunity. FinTRIM (ftr) is a new subset of TRIM genes that do not possess obvious orthologs in higher vertebrates. However, little is known about its function. In this study, we used bioinformatic analysis to examine the phylogenetic relationships and conserved domains of zebrafish (Danio rerio) ftr01, ftr42, and ftr58, as well as qualitative real-time PCR to examine their expression patterns in zebrafish embryonic fibroblast (ZF4) cells and zebrafish tissues. Sequence analysis showed that the three finTRIMs are highly conserved, and all contain a RING domain, B-box domain, and SPRY-PRY domain. In addition, ftr42 and ftr58 had one coiled-coil domain (CCD), whereas ftr01 had two CCDs. Tissue expression analysis revealed that the mRNA level of ftr01 was the highest in the liver, whereas those of ftr42 and ftr58 were the highest in the gill; the expression of these finTRIMs was clearly upregulated not in the eyes, but in the liver, spleen, kidney, gill, and brain of zebrafish following spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. Similarly, the expression of these three finTRIM genes also increased in ZF4 cells after SVCV infection. Our study revealed that ftr01, ftr42, and ftr58 may play an important role in antiviral immune responses, and these findings validate the need for more in-depth research on the finTRIM family in the future.","398":"","399":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by latency-associated transcript are associated with both latent and acute stages of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection. In this study, miRNA-H4-5p and miRNA-H4-3p were ectopically expressed in HeLa cells to explore potential cellular targets of viral miRNAs and demonstrate their potential biological functions. The results showed that miRNA-H4-5p could reverse apoptosis induced by actinomycin D (Act-D) and promote cell cycle progression, but miRNA-H4-3p had no such obvious functions. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase report assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting demonstrated that miRNA-H4-5p could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) to negatively regulate their expression. We verified that these two targeted genes were associated with cell apoptosis and cell cycle. Furthermore, in HeLa cells infected with HSV-2, we detected significantly reduced expression of CDKN2A and CDKL2 and demonstrated the negative regulation effect of miRNA-H4-5p on these two target genes. Our findings show that viral miRNAs play a vital role in regulating the expression of the host's cellular genes that participate in cell apoptosis and progression to reshape the cellular environment in response to HSV-2 infection, providing further information on the roles of encoded herpesvirus miRNAs in pathogen-host interaction.","400":"","401":"","402":null,"403":"Human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) E6 and E7 oncogenes are transcribed as a single bicistronic E6E7 pre-mRNA. The E6 ORF region in the bicistronic E6E7 pre-mRNA contains an intron. Splicing of this intron disrupts the E6 ORF integrity and produces a spliced E6*I RNA for efficient E7 translation. Here we report that the E6 intron has two overlapped branch point sequences (BPS) upstream of its 3' splice site, with an identical heptamer AACUAAC, for E6*I splicing. One heptamer has a branch site adenosine (underlined) at nt 384 and the other at nt 388. E6*I splicing efficiency correlates to the expression level of E6 and E7 proteins and depends on the selection of which branch site. In general, E6*I splicing prefers the 3'ss-proximal branch site at nt 388 over the distal branch site at nt 384. Inactivation of the nt 388 branch site was found to activate a cryptic acceptor site at nt 636 for aberrant RNA splicing. Together, these data suggest that HPV18 modulates its production ratio of E6 and E7 proteins by alternative selection of the two mapped branch sites for the E6*I splicing, which could be beneficial in its productive or oncogenic infection according to the host cell environment.","404":"","405":"Honokiol is a pleiotropic natural compound isolated from Magnolia and has multiple biological and clinically relevant effects, including anticancer and antimicrobial function.

The 5' untranslated region of EV71 contains a cloverleaf-like structure and internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which play an important role in transcription and translation of viral protein. We found that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB) bound to the IRES of EV71. RNA recognition motifs 1 and 2 of PTB were responsible for its binding to the EV71 IRES. Moreover, PTB protein was shuttled from nucleus to cytoplasm after EV71 infection. Additionally, IRES activity and viral protein production were inhibited by PTB knockdown.

To investigate the molecular epidemiology and genetic characteristics of E18 in mainland China, sixteen E18 strains from patient throat swabs with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in six provinces in China collected between 2015 and 2016, and four E18 strains isolated from 18 patient cerebrospinal fluid specimens with VE in Hebei Province in 2015 were obtained and sequenced. Combined with the sequences from the GenBank database, we performed an extensive genetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene sequences revealed that all E18 strains from mainland China after 2015 belonged to subgenotype C2. There were no obvious specific differences in phylogenetic and variation analyses of E18 genome sequences between HFMD and VE\/meningitis strains. Potential multiple recombination may have occurred in the 5'-untranslated region and in the P2 and P3 nonstructural protein-encoding regions of E18 strains from China. The current E18 strains were potential multiple-recombinant viruses. Overall, these findings supported that E18 caused HFMD, VE, and meningitis, although there were no significant associations between clinical features and viral genomic characteristics.","417":"During human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling induces an antiviral state that includes the production of restriction factors that inhibit virus replication, thereby limiting the infection. As seen in other viral infections, type I IFN can also increase systemic immune activation which, in HIV disease, is one of the strongest predictors of disease progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Moreover, IFN-I is associated with CD4 T cell depletion and attenuation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Therefore, therapeutic manipulation of IFN-I signaling to improve HIV disease outcome is a source of much interest and debate in the field. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of timing (acute vs. chronic infection) and have suggested that specific targeting of type I IFNs and their subtypes may help harness the beneficial roles of the IFN-I system while avoiding its deleterious activities.","418":null,"419":"","420":"The family of flaviviruses is one of the most medically important groups of emerging arthropod-borne viruses.

To investigate the variability quantitatively, we retrieved amino acid sequences of 5,167 records of all available HBV genotypes (A-J) from the Genbank database. The amino acid sequences encoded by the open reading frames (ORF) S\/C\/P\/X in the HBV genome were extracted and subjected to alignment. We analyzed the variability of the lengths and the sequences of proteins as well as the frequencies of amino acids. It comprehensively characterized the variability and conservation of HBV proteins at the level of amino acids. Especially for the structural proteins, hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg), there are potential sites critical for virus assembly and immune recognition. Interestingly, the preS1 domains in HBsAg were variable at some positions of amino acid residues, which provides a potential mechanism of immune-escape for HBV, while the preS2 and S domains were conserved in the lengths of protein sequences. In the S domain, the cysteine residues and the secondary structures of the alpha-helix and beta-sheet were likely critical for the stable folding of all HBsAg components. Also, the preC domain and C-terminal domain of the core protein are highly conserved. However, the polymerases (HBpol) and the HBx were highly variable at the amino acid level. Our research provides a basis for understanding the conserved and important domains of HBV viral proteins, which could be potential targets for anti-virus therapy.","425":"","426":"","427":null,"428":"","429":"The development of a vaccine based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) that elicits potent protective antibodies against infection has been challenging. Recently, we compared the antibody production patterns of HIV-1 Env gp120 and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) to provide insights into how we may improve the protective efficacy of Env-based immunogens. Our previous study showed that HIV Env and HBsAg display different mechanisms of antibody elicitation and that T cells facilitate the responses to repeated immunizations. Here, to elucidate the detailed roles of primary immunization in immune memory response formation and antibody production, we immunized C57BL\/6 mice with each antigen and evaluated the development of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, germinal centers, and the memory responses involved in prime and boost immunizations. We found that after prime immunization, compared with HBsAg, gp120 induced higher frequencies of Tfh cells and programmed death (PD)-1+ T cells, greater major histocompatibility complex II expression on B cells, comparable activated B cells, but weaker germinal center (GC) reactions and memory B cell responses in the draining lymph nodes, accompanied by slower antibody recall responses and poor immune memory responses. The above results suggested that more PD-1+ T cells arising in primary immunization may serve as major contributors to the slow antibody recall response elicited by HIV-1 Env.","430":"Mutations in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene of avian influenza viruses are important signatures for their adaptation to mammalian hosts. Various adaptive mutations have been identified around the 627 and nuclear localization sequence (NLS) domains of PB2 protein, and these mutations contribute to the replicative ability of avian influenza viruses. However, few studies have focused on adaptive mutations in other regions of PB2. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of the D253N mutation in PB2 in an H9N2 virus. This mutation was found to affect an amino acid residue in the middle domain of the PB2 protein. The virus with the D253N mutation showed higher polymerase activity and transiently increased viral replication in human cells. However, the mutant did not show significant differences in viral replication in the respiratory tract of mice upon infection. Our results supported that the D253N mutation in the middle domain of PB2, similar to mutations at the 627 and NLS domains, specifically contributed to the replication of avian influenza viruses in human cells.","431":null,"432":"The major difficulties of human papillomavirus (HPV) treatment are its persistence and recurrence. The HPV E7 oncoprotein-loaded dendritic cells have been evaluated as cellular vaccine in previous reports. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play an essential role of connecting the innate immune response and adaptive immune response in the immune system. But they function in HPV E7 loading is unclear. To investigate whether loading of the HPV type 6b, 11, and 16 E7 proteins affects the activity of pDCs, human peripheral blood-separated pDCs and mouse bone marrow-derived pDCs were pulsed with the HPV E7 proteins. The expression levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC II were significantly upregulated in pDCs upon HPV 6b\/11 E7 protein pulse. The secretion and gene expression of type I IFN and IL-6 were both upregulated by HPV 6b\/11 E7 proteins, more significant than HPV 16 E7 protein. The expression of essential factors of TLR signaling pathway and JNK\/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway were all increased in HPV 6b\/11 E7 proteins pulsed pDCs. Our results suggest that HPV E7 proteins could promote the differentiation and maturation of pDCs and activate the TLR and MAPK pathway to induce host innate immune response.

Recently we generated a comprehensive map of HCV-miRNA interactions through genome-wide miRNA functional screens and transcriptomics analyses. Many previously unappreciated cellular miRNAs were identified to be involved in HCV infection, including miR-135a, a human cancer-related miRNA. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-135a in regulating HCV life cycle and showed that it preferentially enhances viral genome replication. Bioinformatics-based integrative analyses and subsequent functional assays revealed three antiviral host factors, including receptor interacting serine\/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), as bona fide targets of miR-135a. These genes have been shown to inhibit HCV infection at the RNA replication stage. Our data demonstrated that repression of key host restriction factors mediated the proviral effect of miR-135a on HCV propagation. In addition, miR-135a hepatic abundance is upregulated by HCV infection in both cultured hepatocytes and human liver, likely mediating a more favorable environment for viral replication and possibly contributing to HCV-induced liver malignancy. These results provide novel insights into HCV-host interactions and unveil molecular pathways linking miRNA biology to HCV pathogenesis.","438":"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious transboundary animal disease with a severe socio-economic impact on the livestock industry, particularly in poor countries where it is endemic.

In the RE group, EBV and HHV6 antigens were detected in 56.7% (17\/30) and 50% (15\/30) of individuals, respectively. In contrast, no detectable EBV and HHV6 antigen expression was found in brain tissues of the control group. The co-expression of EBV and HHV6 was detected in 20.0% (6\/30) of individuals. In particular, a 4-year-old boy had a typical clinical course, including a medical history of viral encephalitis, intractable epilepsy, and hemispheric atrophy. The co-expression of EBV and HHV6 was detected in neurons and astrocytes in the brain tissue, accompanied by a high frequency of CD8+ T cells.

However, the mechanism by which CypA regulates M1 ubiquitination remains unknown. In this study, we reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 promoted K48-linked ubiquitination of M1 at K102 and K104, and accelerated ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of M1. The recombinant IAV with mutant M1 (K102R\/K104R) could not be rescued, suggesting that the ubiquitination of M1 at K102\/K104 was essential for IAV replication. Furthermore, CypA inhibited AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination by impairing the interaction between AIP4 and M1. More importantly, both the mutations of M1 (K102R\/K104R) and CypA inhibited the nuclear export of M1, indicating that CypA regulates the cellular localization of M1 via inhibition of AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination at K102 and K104, which results in the reduced replication of IAV. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel ubiquitination-based mechanism by which CypA regulates the replication of IAV.","450":"Seneca Valley virus (SVV), a newly determined etiological agent of vesicular disease in swine, causes porcine idiopathic disease and occasional acute death in piglets. Recently, an increased number of SVV infection cases have been reported in the United States (US) and China, resulting in significant economic losses to the swine industry. The first identification of SVV in China was reported in Guangdong Province, a major swine producing province. The cases of SVV were continuously reported in Guangdong in 2015 and 2016. However, the spread of SVV in Guangdong in 2017 remains unknown. In this study, we determined two new SVV strains, CH-GD-2017-1 and CH-GD-2017-2, from Guangdong. The genetic analysis suggested that the two Guangdong strains showed different characteristics to previous Guangdong strains. They showed lower nucleotide similarity with strains isolated in 2015 and 2016, and were more similar to the US strains. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the new strains were clustered in a different clade with previous Guangdong strains. We found 28 mutated amino acids in the new strains, compared with the first Guangdong strain, SVV CH-01-2015. In the geographic analysis, we found that the US and China reported more SVV cases than other countries, and most of the SVV cases were reported in east and central China-of which, Guangdong Province is one of the major epidemic regions. In conclusion, our findings indicate that SVV continued to spread in Guangdong Province in 2017, and two different clades of SVVs have emerged in this region.","451":"Nipah virus (NiV), a zoonotic paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus, is classified as a Biosafety Level-4 pathogen based on its high pathogenicity in humans and the lack of available vaccines or therapeutics.

Sporadic outbreaks and person-to-person transmission over the past two decades have resulted in hundreds of human fatalities. Epidemiological surveys have shown that NiV is distributed in Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific Ocean, and is transmitted by its natural reservoir, Pteropid bats.

To address this issue, in this study we carried out a whole-genome transcriptome analysis of PRRSV-infected Marc-145 African green monkey kidney cells and identified 185 APA switching genes and 393 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Most of these genes were involved in cellular process, metabolism, and biological regulation, and there was some overlap between the two gene sets. DEGs were found to be more directly involved in the antiviral response than APA genes. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of host gene regulation during PRRSV infection and a basis for elucidating the pathogenesis of PRRSV.","457":"This study aimed to investigate the serological characteristics of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection during the late phase of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. In total, 877 blood samples from 694 suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases assessed from March to December 2015, were analyzed via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Luminex to detect antibodies against EBOV. Viral load and EBOV-specific IgM\/IgG titers displayed a declining trend during March to December 2015. Viral RNA load decreased rapidly at earlier stages after disease onset, while EBOV-specific IgM and IgG still persisted in 58.1% (18\/31) and 93.5% (29\/31) of the confirmed EVD patients and in 3.8% (25\/663) and 17.8% (118\/663) of the RNA-negative suspected patients in the later phase, respectively. Dynamic analysis of longitudinally collected samples from eight EVD patients revealed typically reversed trends of declining viral load and increasing IgM and\/or IgG titers in response to the EBOV infection. The present results indicate that certain populations of Sierra Leone developed immunity to an EBOV infection in the late phase of the outbreak, providing novel insights into the risk assessment of EBOV infections among human populations.","458":null,"459":"Baculoviruses are effective biological control agents for many insect pests. They not only efficiently challenge the host immune system but also make them hyperactive for better virus dispersal. Some investigations have focused on the viral mechanisms for induction of such altered response from the host.

The L. dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) induces hyperactivity in third instar L. dispar larvae at 3-days post infection (dpi), to continued till 6 dpi. The transcriptome profiles of the infected and uninfected larvae at these time points were analyzed to provide new clues on the response of the larvae towards infection during hyperactivity. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed, most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in proteolysis, extracellular region, and serine-type endopeptidase activity. Similarly, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome enrichment analysis showed maximum enrichment of 487 genes of the signal transduction category and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction sub-category with 85 annotated genes. In addition, enrichment map visualization of gene set enrichment analysis showed the coordinated response of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction genes with other functional gene sets, as an important signal transduction mechanism during the hyperactive stage. Interestingly all the DEGs in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions were serine proteases, their differential expression during the hyperactive stage correlated with their conceivable involvement in disease progression and the resulting altered phenotype during this period. The outcome provides a basic understanding of L. dispar larval responses to LdMNPV infection during the hyperactive stage and helps to determine the important host factors involved in this process.","460":"","461":"","462":"Stress granules (SGs) are intracellular granules formed when cellular translation is blocked and have been reported to be involved in a variety of viral infections.

In this study, we found that CVB type 3 (CVB3) could induce SG formation in the early phase of infection. Results showed that levels of CVB3 RNA and protein were significantly inhibited during the early stage of CVB3 infection by the elevated formation of SGs, while viral RNA and protein synthesis were significantly promoted when SG formation was blocked.

These have been shown to be efficacious in preclinical studies in mice and nonhuman primates, but their use will potentially be a threat to immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are empty particles composed merely of viral proteins, which can serve as a safe and valuable tool for clinical prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we used a new strategy to produce ZIKV VLPs based on the baculovirus expression system and demonstrated the feasibility of their use as a vaccine candidate. The pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins were co-expressed in insect cells and self-assembled into particles similar to ZIKV. We found that the ZIKV VLPs could be quickly and easily prepared in large quantities using this system. The VLPs were shown to have good immunogenicity in immunized mice, as they stimulated high levels of virus neutralizing antibody titers, ZIKV-specific IgG titers and potent memory T cell responses. Thus, the baculovirus-based ZIKV VLP vaccine is a safe, effective and economical vaccine candidate for use against ZIKV.","470":"Oncolytic measles virus (OMV) is a promising antitumor agent. However, the presence of anti-measles neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin (H) protein of OMV is a major barrier to the therapeutic application of OMV in clinical practice. In order to overcome this challenge, specific types of cells have been used as carriers for OMV. Differential loading strategies appear to result in different therapeutic outcomes; despite this, only few studies have reported practical ex vivo loading strategies required for effective treatment. To this end, we systematically evaluated the antitumor efficacy of OMV using different loading strategies; this involved varying the in vitro loading duration and loading dose of OMV. We found that improved oncolysis of carrier cells was achieved by a prolonged loading duration in the absence of NAbs. However, the enhanced oncolytic effect was abrogated in the presence of NAbs. Further, we found that the expression of H protein on the surface of carrier cells was predominantly determined by the loading duration rather than the loading dose. Finally, we showed that NAbs blocked viral transfer by targeting H protein prior to the occurrence of cell-to-cell interactions. Our results provide comprehensive information on the determinants of an effective loading strategy for carrier cell-based virotherapy; these results may be useful for guiding the application of OMV as an antitumor agent in clinical practice.","471":null,"472":null,"473":"","474":null,"475":"Wheat dwarf disease caused by wheat dwarf virus (WDV) is currently present in wheat growing regions in China and causes serious losses in wheat yield.

Using the prepared MAbs, an antigen-coated-plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) and a dot-ELISA were established for detecting WDV in wheat samples. The most sensitive ACP-ELISA based on MAb 23F4 or 22A10 was able to detect WDV in 1:163,840 (w\/v, g\/mL) diluted WDV-infected wheat plant crude extracts.

A total of 128 wheat samples were collected from wheat growing regions in the Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces, China, and were screened for the presence of WDV using two developed serological assays. Results from the survey showed that approximately 62% of the samples were infected with WDV.

PCV2 is pathogenic to pigs, but the pathogenicity of PCV3 in pigs is debatable. Recently, there have been frequent reports of PCV2 and PCV3 co-infections in clinical samples. Thus, it would be practical to develop a duplex PCR method to detect PCV2 and PCV3 simultaneously. In this study, specific primers and probes were designed to target PCV2 cap and PCV3 rep genes. A duplex real-time PCR method was then developed to detect the two viruses. The assay was found to be highly specific, sensitive, and reproducible for PCV2\/3 without cross-reactions with other swine pathogens. The sensitivity of this assay was 2.9 copies for the PCV2 plasmid and 22.5 copies for the PCV3 plasmid. The established assay was then used to detect PCV2\/3 infection in 340 clinical samples collected in the first half of 2017.

It was found that compared with the mice with no exercise after vaccination, no significant differences were found in those with exhaustive exercise after vaccination on body-weight changes, virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers, antibody subtypes and survivor ratio after lethal rabies virus (RABV) challenge.

Filamin B is an actin-binding protein that acts as a cytoskeleton protein, and it is involved in cell development and several signaling pathways. In this study, we showed that filamin B interacted with HBV core protein, and the interaction promoted HBV replication. The interaction between filamin B and core protein was observed in HEK 293T, Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization immnofluoresence. Overexpression of filamin B increased the levels of HBV total RNAs and pre-genome RNA (pgRNA), and improved the secretion level of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). In contrast, filamin B knockdown inhibited HBV replication, decreased the level of HBV total RNAs and pgRNA, and reduced the secretion level of HBsAg and HBeAg. In addition, we found that filamin B and core protein may interact with each other via four blocks of argentine residues at the C-terminus of core protein. In conclusion, we identify filamin B as a novel host factor that can interact with core protein to promote HBV replication in hepatocytes.

Consistent with the bioassay result, PIF complex was detected in ODVs of pif3 pseudotyped virus only but not in pif1 or pif2 pseudotyped viruses. Our results suggest that PIF complex is essential for oral infectivity, and in the formation of the PIF complex, PIF1, 2 are virus-specific while PIF3 does not appear to be as specific and can function in heterologous environment, albeit to a much more limited extent.","484":"The cGAS-MITA pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing plays essential roles in immune response against pathogens that contain DNA or with DNA production in their life cycles.

Here we investigated whether the Nullbasic antagonists huTat2 (a Tat targeting intrabody), HIV-1 Tat or Rev proteins or cellular DDX1 protein could improve transduction by a HIV-1 lentiviral vector conveying Nullbasic-ZsGreen1 to human T cells. We show that overexpression of huTat2, Tat-FLAG and DDX1-HA in virus-like particle (VLP) producer cells significantly improved transduction efficiency of VLPs that convey Nullbasic in Jurkat cells. Specifically, co-expression of Tat-FLAG and DDX1-HA in the VLP producer cell improved transduction efficiency better than if used individually. Transduction efficiencies could be further improved by including a spinoculation step. However, the same optimised protocol and using the same VLPs failed to transduce primary human CD4+ T cells. The results imply that the effects of Nullbasic on VLPs on early HIV-1 replication are robust in human CD4+ T cells.

Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, Iridoviridae, Mesoniviridae, Microviridae, Myoviridae, Parvoviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Podoviridae were the top ten significantly different viral families among the four species. Further analysis reveals that the virome is species-specific in four mosquito samples, and several viral sequences which maybe belong to novel viruses are discovered for the first time in those mosquitoes. This investigation provides a basis for a comprehensive knowledge on the mosquito virome status in China.","501":"","502":"The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus, which has infected millions of people in Africa, Asia, Americas, and Europe since it reemerged in India and Indian Ocean regions in 2005-2006. Starting in the middle of November 2016, CHIKV has been widely spread, and more than 4,000 cases of infections in humans were confirmed in Pakistan. Here, we report the first isolation and characterization of CHIKV from the Pakistan outbreak. Eight CHIKV strains were newly isolated from human serum samples using a cell culture procedure. A full-length genome sequence and eight complete envelope (E1) sequences of CHIKV from Pakistan were obtained in this study. Alignment of the CHIKV E1 sequences revealed that the eight new CHIKV isolates were highly homogeneous, with only two nonsynonymous substitutions found at generally conserved sites (E99 and Q235). Based on the comparison of 342 E1 sequences, the two nonsynonymous mutations were located in well-recognized domains associated with viral functions such as the cell fusion and vector specificity, suggesting their potential functional importance. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the CHIKV strains from Pakistan originated from CHIKV circulating in the Indian region. This study helps elucidate the epidemics of CHIKV in Pakistan and also provides a foundation for studies of evolution and expansion of CHIKV in South Asia.","503":"Chronic hepatitis B infection is caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a total cure is yet to be achieved. The viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is the key to establish a persistent infection within hepatocytes. Current antiviral strategies have no effect on the pre-existing cccDNA reservoir. Therefore, the study of the molecular mechanism of cccDNA formation is becoming a major focus of HBV research. This review summarizes the current advances in cccDNA molecular biology and the latest studies on the elimination or inactivation of cccDNA, including three major areas: (1) epigenetic regulation of cccDNA by HBV X protein, (2) immune-mediated degradation, and (3) genome-editing nucleases. All these aspects provide clues on how to finally attain a cure for chronic hepatitis B infection.","504":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes epidemics widely in the world especially in the tropical and subtropical regions. Phylogenetic analysis has found that the CHIKV lineages were associated with the spatial and temporal distributions, which were related to the virus adaption to the major mosquito species and their distributions. In this study, we reported the complete genome sequences of eight CHIKV isolates from the outbreak in Pakistan last year. Then we reviewed the evolutionary history using extensive phylogenetic analysis, analyzed lineage-specific substitutions in viral proteins, and characterized the spreading pathway of CHIKV strains including the Pakistani strains. The results showed that the Pakistani stains belonged to the ECSA.IOL sub-lineage and derived from India. The genetic properties of the Pakistani strains including the adaptive substitution to vectors were further characterized, and the potential risks from the occurrence of CHIKV infection in Pakistan were discussed. These results provided better understanding of CHIKV evolution and transmission in the world and revealed the possible origination of the CHIKV outbreak and epidemic in Pakistan, which would promote the disease prevention and control in the identified countries and territories with the history of CHIKV infections as well as new regions with potential risk of CHIKV outbreaks.","505":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitos in tropical and subtropical regions across the world. After decades of sporadic outbreaks, it re-emerged in Africa, Asia, India Ocean and America suddenly, causing major regional epidemics recently and becoming a notable global health problem. Infection by CHIKV results in a spectrum of clinical diseases including an acute self-limiting febrile illness in most individuals, a chronic phase of recurrent join pain in a proportion of patients, and long-term arthralgia for months to years for the unfortunate few. No specific anti-viral drugs or licensed vaccines for CHIKV are available so far. A better understanding of virus-host interactions is essential for the development of therapeutics and vaccines. To this end, we reviewed the existing knowledge on CHIKV's epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular virology, diagnostic approaches, host immune response, vaccine development, and available animal models. Such a comprehensive overview, we believe, will shed lights on the promises and challenges in CHIKV vaccine development.","506":"Bacterial wilt is a devastating disease of potato and can cause an 80% production loss. To control wilt using bacteriophage therapy, we isolated and characterized twelve lytic bacteriophages from different water sources in Kenya and China. Based on the lytic curves of the phages with the pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, one optimal bacteriophage cocktail, P1, containing six phage isolations was formulated and used for studying wilt prevention and treatment efficiency in potato plants growing in pots. The preliminary tests showed that the phage cocktail was very effective in preventing potato bacterial wilt by injection of the phages into the plants or decontamination of sterilized soil spiked with R. solanacearum. Eighty percent of potato plants could be protected from the bacterial wilt (caused by R. solanacearum reference strain GIM1.74 and field isolates), and the P1 cocktail could kill 98% of live bacteria spiked in the sterilized soil at one week after spraying. However, the treatment efficiencies of P1 depended on the timing of application of the phages, the susceptibility of the plants to the bacterial wilt, as well as the virulence of the bacteria infected, suggesting that it is important to apply the phage therapy as soon as possible once there are early signs of the bacterial wilt. These results provide the basis for the development of bacteriophagebased biocontrol of potato bacterial wilt as an alternative to the use of antibiotics.","507":"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by RNA viruses represent a unique class of nucleic acid polymerases. Unlike other classes of single-subunit polymerases, viral RdRPs have evolved a unique conformational change in their palm domain to close the active site during catalysis. The hallmark of this conformational change is the backbone shift of the polymerase motif A from an \"open\" state to a \"closed\" state, allowing two universally conserved aspartic acid residues to orient toward each other for divalent metal binding and catalysis. The \"closed\" motif A conformation was only observed upon the binding of correct NTP in RdRP catalytic complexes or under rare conditions such as induced by a bound lutetium ion or a bound glutamate molecule. By solving the crystal structure of the catalytic elongation complex of the coxsackievirus RdRP, we in this work observed for the first time the \"closed\" motif A conformation in the absence of an NTP substrate or other conformational-change-inducing factors. This observation emphasizes the intrinsic dynamic features of viral RdRP motif A, and solidifies the structural basis for how this important structural element participates in catalytic events of the RdRPs.","508":"","509":null,"510":"Viruses commonly create favorable cellular conditions for their survival through multiple mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which function as post-transcriptional regulators, are utilized by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in its infection and pathogenesis. In the present study, the DNA replication inhibitor Geminin (GMNN) was identified to be a direct target of hcmv-miR-US5-1. Overexpression of hcmv-miR-US5-1 could block the accumulation of GMNN during HCMV infection, and the decrease of GMNN expression caused by hcmv-miR-US5-1 or GMNN specific siRNA reduced HCMV DNA copies in U373 cells. Meanwhile, ectopic expression of hcmv-miR-US5-1 and consequent lower expression of GMNN influenced host cell cycle and proliferation. These results imply that hcmv-miR-US5-1 may affect viral replication and host cellular environment by regulating expression kinetics of GMNN during HCMV infection.","511":"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that causes chickenpox and shingles. ORF7 is an important virulence determinant of VZV in both human skin and nerve tissues, however, its specific function and involved molecular mechanism in VZV pathogenesis remain largely elusive. Previous yeast two-hybrid studies on intraviral protein-protein interaction network in herpesviruses have revealed that VZV ORF7 may interact with ORF53, which is a virtually unstudied but essential viral protein. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize VZV ORF53, and to investigate its relationship with ORF7. For this purpose, we prepared monoclonal antibodies against ORF53 and, for the first time, characterized it as a ~40 kDa viral protein predominantly localizing to the trans-Golgi network of the infected host cell. Next, we further confirmed the interaction between ORF7 and ORF53 by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies in both plasmid-transfected and VZV-infected cells. Moreover, interestingly, we found that ORF53 lost its trans-Golgi network localization and became dispersed in the cytoplasm of host cells infected with an ORF7-deleted recombinant VZV, and thus ORF7 seems to play a role in normal subcellular localization of ORF53. Collectively, these results suggested that ORF7 and ORF53 may function as a complex during infection, which may be implicated in VZV pathogenesis.","512":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the infectious etiologic agent associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. It has been shown that high KSHV prevalence and high incidence of both classic KS and AIDSassociated KS are found mostly among people of Uygur ethnicity in Xinjiang, while people of Han ethnicity in Xinjiang have a higher KSHV seroprevalence than those of other Han populations in mainland China. However, it is still unclear why there is such geographical and population variation in KSHV distribution in China. In this work, we focused on the populations in the Kashgar region and Urumqi area, where a total of 1294 research subjects were randomly selected to investigate the potential correlation between KSHV prevalence and different ethnicities in endemic areas of Xinjiang, and to determine risk factors that may affect KSHV infection rates or KS incidence. We identified a high seroprevalence of KSHV and high peripheral blood DNA infection in the general Uygur and Han populations in both Urumqi and Kashgar regions of Xinjiang, and determined that advancing age, low education level, and stationary population status affect KSHV infection rates. Further, KSHV-positive Uygur participants were shown to have higher prevalence of neutralizing antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers than KSHV-positive Han participants.","513":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a herpesvirus, is an important human pathogen that causes asymptomatic infections in healthy or immunocompetent individuals but can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening complications in immune-immature individuals such as neonates or immune-compromised patients such as organ-transplant recipients and HIV-positive individuals. Congenital HCMV infection represents a significant public health issue and poses substantial healthcare and economic burden to society. This virus causes the most common viral congenital infection worldwide, and is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss in children in developed countries. Congenital HCMV infection is believed to fulfill the criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics to be considered as a condition targeted for a newborn screening program. This is because congenital HCMV infection can be identified during a time (within 2 days after birth) at which it would not ordinarily be detected clinically, and there are demonstrated benefits of early detection, timely intervention, and efficacious treatment of the condition. Recent progresses in developing polymerase chain reaction-based approaches to detect HCMV in samples obtained from newborns have generated much excitement in the field. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in diagnostic techniques that could potentially be used for the detection of HCMV infection in neonates and its direct implications in public health settings for diagnosing congenital HCMV infection.","514":"Herpesviruses are remarkable pathogens that have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade host immunity, ensuring their proliferation and egress. Among these mechanisms, herpesviruses utilize elaborate extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, for the intricate interplay between infected host and recipient cells. Herpesviruses incorporate genome expression products and direct cellular products into exosomal cargoes. These components alter the content and function of exosomes released from donor cells, thus affecting the downstream signalings of recipient cells. In this way, herpesviruses hijack exosomal pathways to ensure their survival and persistence, and exosomes are emerging as critical mediators for virus infection-associated intercellular communication and microenvironment alteration. In this review, the function and effects of exosomes in herpesvirus infection will be discussed, so that we will have a better understanding about the pathogenesis of herpesviruses.","515":"Activation of specific sets of protein kinases by intracellular signal molecules has become more and more apparent in the past decade. Phosphorylation, one of key posttranslational modification events, is activated by kinase or regulatory protein and is vital for controlling many physiological functions of eukaryotic cells such as cell proliferation, differentiation, malignant transformation, and signal transduction mediated by external stimuli. Moreovers, the reversible modification of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can result in different features of the target substrate molecules including DNA binding, protein-protein interaction, subcellular location and enzymatic activity, and is often hijacked by viral infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), two human oncogenic gamma-herpesviruses, are shown to tightly associate with many malignancies. In this review, we summarize the recent progresses on understanding of molecular properties and regulatory modes of cellular and viral proteins phosphorylation influenced by these two tumor viruses, and highlight the potential therapeutic targets and strategies against their related cancers.","516":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 180 million people worldwide. Significant progress has been made since the establishment of in vitro HCV infection models in cells. However, the replication of HCV is complex and not completely understood. Here, we found that the expression of host prion protein (PrP) was induced in an HCV replication cell model. We then showed that increased PrP expression facilitated HCV genomic replication. Finally, we demonstrated that the KKRPK motif on the N-terminus of PrP bound nucleic acids and facilitated HCV genomic replication. Our results provided important insights into how viruses may harness cellular protein to achieve propagation.","517":"Anelloviruses are single-strand circular DNA viruses and ubiquitous within the human population. Although there is no direct evidence, many studies have suggested the anelloviruses may be associated with a variety of diseases. In this study, a novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was detected in a child with unexplained encephalitis. The detected virus had a circular genome of 2943 nt in length and 3 open reading frames. It shared 45.4% - 35.9% nucleotide identities with known TTMV species and &lt; 35% with the other species of anellovirus, which suggested it might belong to a new species within the genus Betatorquevirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of ORF1 showed that this virus represented a distinct branch within the diversity of anellovirus. Whether this novel anellovirus strain is associated with encephalitis requires further study.","518":"Intravenous drug users (IDUs) have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to HIV\/AIDS. Nevertheless, the prevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an important co-infected agent with HIV, among this population remained obscure. We conducted a systematic review on the epidemiological features of KSHV among IDUs worldwide. Eligible studies were retrieved from 6 electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang). We calculated the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) overall and among subgroups using either random-effects model or fixed-effects model depending on between-study heterogeneity. The potential publication bias was assessed by the Egger's test. A meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Finally, twenty-two studies with a total sample of 7881 IDUs were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of KSHV was 14.71% (95% CI 11.12%-19.46%) among IDUs. Specifically, KSHV prevalence was 10.86% (95% CI 6.95%-16.96%) in HIV-negative IDUs, and 13.56% (95% CI 10.57%-17.38%) in HIV-positive IDUs. Moreover, prevalence among IDUs from the three continents involved in the current study was similar: 16.10% (95%CI 7.73%-33.54%) in Asia; 14.22% (95%CI 8.96%-22.57%) in Europe and 14.06% (95%CI 11.38%-17.37%) in America. Globally, IDUs are at higher risk of the KSHV infection when compared with the general population, regardless of geographical region or HIV-infection status.","519":"Lipids are essential for mammalian cells to maintain many physiological functions. Emerging evidence has shown that cancer cells can develop specific alterations in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism to facilitate their survival and various malignant behaviors. To date, the precise role of cellular lipids and lipid metabolism in viral oncogenesis is still largely unclear with only a handful of literature covering this topic to implicate lipid metabolism in oncogenic virus associated pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on the role of lipid biosynthesis and metabolism in the pathogenesis of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, a common causative factor for cancers arising in the immunocompromised settings.","520":"We previously constructed a herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) UL7 mutant virus (M1) and showed that a partial deletion mutation of the UL7 gene led to a lower proliferative rate and an attenuated phenotype. Using the M1 mutant, we further modified the UL41 gene, which encodes another tegument protein, and the latency-associated transcript (LAT) gene. Observations of the resulting mutants with modified UL7 and UL41 (M2) or UL7, UL41 and LAT (M3) genes indicated attenuated phenotypes, with lower proliferative ratios in various cells, non-lethal infections in mice and lower viral loads in nervous tissues compared with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, no LAT stable intron could be detected in the trigeminal ganglion of M3-infected animals. The results obtained with the three HSV-1 mutants indicate that the M3 mutant is an attenuated strain with low pathogenicity during both acute and latent infections. Together, the results support the use of the M3 mutant as a candidate for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine.","521":"Feasible and effective cell models for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are required for investigating the complete lifecycle of this virus, including the early steps of viral entry. Resistance to dimethyl sulfoxide\/polyethylene glycol (DMSO\/PEG), hNTCP expression, and a differentiated state are the limiting factors for successful HBV infection models. In the present study, we used a hepatoma cell line (Huh7DhNTCP) to overcome these limiting factors so that it exhibits excellent susceptibility to HBV infection. To achieve this goal, different hepatoma cell lines were tested with 2.5% DMSO \/ 4% PEG8000, and one resistant cell line (Huh7D) was used to construct a stable hNTCP-expressing cell line (Huh7DhNTCP) using a recombinant lentivirus system. Then, the morphological characteristics and differentiation molecular markers of Huh7DhNTCP cells with or without DMSO treatment were characterized. Finally, the susceptibility of Huh7DhNTCP cells to HBV infection was assessed. Our results showed that Huh7D cells were resistant to 2.5% DMSO \/ 4% PEG8000, whereas the others were not. Huh7DhNTCP cells were established to express a high level of hNTCP compared to liver extracts, and Huh7DhNTCP cells rapidly transformed into a non-dividing, well-differentiated polarized phenotype under DMSO treatment. Huh7DhNTCP cells fully supported the entire lifecycle of HBV infection. This cell culture system will be useful for the analysis of host-virus interactions, which should facilitate the discovery of antiviral drugs and vaccines.","522":"HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are present during chronic infection, but the relative contributions of these effector mechanisms to viral containment remain unclear. Here, using an in vitro model involving autologous CD4+ T cells, primary HIV-1 isolates, HIV-1-specific CTLs, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, we show that b12, a potent and broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody to HIV-1, was able to block viral infection when preincubated with virus prior to infection, but was much less effective than CTLs at limiting virus replication when added to infected cell cultures. However, the same neutralizing antibody was able to contain viruses by antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition in vitro, which was mediated by natural killer cells (NKs) and dependent on an Fc-Fc receptor interaction. Meanwhile, bulk CTLs from HIV-1 controllers were more effective in suppression of virus replication than those from progressors. These findings indicate that control of HIV-1 replication in activated CD4+ T cells is ineffectively mediated by neutralizing antibodies alone, but that both CTLs and antibody-dependent NK-mediated immune mechanisms contribute to viral containment. Our study systemically compared three major players in controlling HIV-1 infection, CTLs, NAbs, and NKs, in an autologous system and highlighted the multifactorial mechanisms for viral containment and vaccine success.","523":"Q3G is a natural derivative of quercetin and is already widely used in various foods and drinks. Our results clearly demonstrated that Q3G exerts antiviral activity against ZIKV in both tissue culture and knockout mice, and that post-exposure in vivo treatment with Q3G could have a beneficial effect. In the future, Q3G should be tested in human cell lines (such as Huh-7, HeLa, or K048, a fetal brain neural stem cell line) to provide further data supporting its potential efficacy in humans; in addition, live viral loads or viremia should be tested in treated animals to supplement the survival results observed in this study. Although the treatment regimens will need to be further optimized (i.e., dosage, frequency of treatment, and administration routes), our results support the results of Q3G efficacy studies in nonhuman primates against ZIKV infection. Further studies will also be needed to investigate the mechanism of Q3G antiviral action, in order to obtain valuable insights into the design of novel targets for antiviral therapeutics in the future.","524":"Skin-resident dendritic cells (DCs) likely encounter incoming viruses in the first place, and their migration to lymph nodes following virus capture may promote viral replication. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. In the present study, we found that compared to cell-free viruses, DC-bound viruses showed enhanced capture of JEV by T cells. Additionally, JEV infection was increased by co-culturing DCs and T cells. Blocking the C-type lectin receptor DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) with neutralizing antibodies or antagonists blocked JEV transmission to T cells. Live-cell imaging revealed that DCs captured and transferred JEV viral particles to T cells via virological synapses formed at DC-T cell junctions. These findings indicate that DC-SIGN plays an important role in JEV transmission from DCs to T cells and provide insight into how JEV exploits the migratory and antigen-presenting capabilities of DCs to gain access to lymph nodes for dissemination and persistence in the host.","525":"In this study, we improved the most commonly used methods for MS detection of SUMOylated sites and used an E. coli recombination SUMOylation system with SUMO-1 (T95R). This system provides fast enrichment of SUMOylated viral protein in less than 2 days, and shows advantage over the method of collecting modified protein from cells in convenience and sensitivity. Furthermore, this method provides an option for rapid and accurate identification of the potential viral protein SUMOylation sites.","526":"Rabies remains a public health threat that kills approximately 59,000 people worldwide each year, most of which are from the developing countries of Africa and Asia where dog rabies are endemic. Therefore, developing an affordable and efficacious vaccine is crucial for rabies control in these countries. Interleukin (IL)-15, an immunoregulatory cytokine, is a pluripotent molecule with therapeutic potential, which targets many cell types and links the innate and adaptive immune system. In this study, IL-15 gene was cloned and inserted into the genome of a recombinant rabies virus (RABV) strain LBNSE (designated as LBNSE-IL15), and the effect of over-expression of IL-15 on the immunogenicity of RABV was investigated. It was found that mice vaccinated with LBNSE-IL15 could induce significantly higher level of virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) than those immunized with LBNSE, resulting in the higher protection after challenge. Further investigation was performed to find out the possible role of IL-15 plays in the process of antibody induction, and it was found that LBNSE-IL15 could enhance the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in immunized mice. Furthermore, the mice immunized with LBNSE-IL15 could promote the TFH cells differentiation and the generation of germinal center B cells and plasma cells. Together, these data indicated that IL-15 could be a potential adjuvant in enhancing the immunogenicity of RABV, contributing to the development of more-efficacious rabies vaccines.","527":"In summary, we show here that HCV infection is associated with an upregulation of ARF4, which promotes HCV replication. Upon HCV infection, CREB3 was redistributed to nucleus and activated ARF4 transcription. Our studies demonstrate a host factor ARF4 upregulated in HCV replication, which may provide new therapeutic targets for antiviral therapy.","528":null,"529":null,"530":"","531":"The emergence of highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants in China caused huge economic losses in 2010. Since then, large-scale sporadic outbreaks of PED caused by PEDV variants have occasionally occurred in China. However, the molecular diversity and epidemiology of PEDV in different provinces has not been completely understood. To determine the molecular diversity of PEDV in the Hubei Province of China, we collected 172 PED samples from 34 farms across the province in 2016 and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Seventy-four samples were found to be PEDV-positive. We further characterized the complete spike (S) glycoprotein genes from the positive samples and found 21 different S genes with amino acid mutations. The PEDV isolates here presented most of the genotypes which were found previously in field isolates in East and South-East Asia, North America, and Europe. Besides the typical Genotypes I and II, the INDEX groups were also found. Importantly, 58 new amino acids mutant sites in the S genes, including 44 sites in S1 and 14 sites in S2, were first described. Our results revealed that the S genes of PEDV showed variation and that diverse genotypes of PEDV coexisted and were responsible for the PED outbreaks in Hubei in 2016. This work highlighted the complexity of the epidemiology of PEDV and emphasized the need for reassessing the efficacy of classic PEDV vaccines against emerging variant strains and developing new vaccines to facilitate the prevention and control of PEDV in fields.","532":"","533":"Since 2010, variant strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have caused disasters in the pork industry. The spike (S) protein, as the major immunity-eliciting antigen, has previously been used for serological testing and has been found to correlate significantly with the results of the serum neutralization (SN) test. However, further evaluation of this method is needed as new epidemic strains of PEDV emerge. Hence, the main objective of this study was to assess sow sera and determine the correlation between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results (involving a newly isolated GDS01 virus-based ELISA and ELISAs based on seven recombinant fragments comprising overlapping S1 and partial S2 sequences) and SN titers. Furthermore, we determined the reliability of the ELISAs based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses. For the most promising ELISA, i.e., the SP4 ELISA, the correlation coefficient (r) and the area under curve (AUC) were determined to be 0.6113 and 0.8538, respectively. In addition, we analyzed the homology of the SP4 sequences obtained from different strains (including vaccine strains) and found that various strains showed a high degree of homology in this region. Thus, we conclude that SP4 is a promising serological testing protein for use in the field.","534":"Diverse species of rodents and shrews, which are abundant worldwide, harbor a variety of viruses; some of these are closely related to human viruses and possess zoonotic potential. Previously studies have demonstrated that the mammarenavirus and hantavirus carried by rodents or shrews could cause diseases in human population. To determine the distribution of zoonotic viruses in Shenzhen city, the major city in southern China with a high population density, we analyzed 225 rodents (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus flavipectus) and 196 shrews (Suncus murinus) from urban and rural districts for the presence of mammarenavirus, hantavirus, and hepatitis E virus (HEV) by RT-PCR targeting the conserved regions. The infection rates for mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and HEV in rodents and shrews were 3.56%, 6.89%, and 1.66%, respectively. Partial genome fragment analysis indicated that mammarenavirus and hantavirus strains had more than 90% and 99% nucleic acid identity with Cardamones virus and Seoul virus, respectively, which cause diseases in humans. Although the present HEV strains identified are typically found worldwide, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a divergence of 16%. To our knowledge, the present work is the first report of the prevalence of mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and rat HEV strains in rodents and shrews from Shenzhen city, China. Our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of rodent- and shrew-borne mammarenavirus and hantavirus, and the biodiversity of rat HEV isolates in Shenzhen city. The present work suggests that utilization of good hygiene habits is important to minimize the risk of zoonosis.","535":"Innate immunity provides immediate defense against viral infection. Influenza A virus (IAV) is able to get past the first line of defense. Elucidation of the molecular interaction between influenza factors and the newly recognized host players in the innate response might help in our understanding of the root causes of virulence and pathogenicity of IAV. In this study, we show that expression of miR-26a leads to a significant inhibition of IAV replication. miR-26a does not directly target IAV genome. Instead, miR-26a activates the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway and promotes the production of IFN-stimulated genes, thus suppressing viral replication. Furthermore, ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3), a negative regulator of type I IFN pathway, is targeted by miR-26a upon IAV challenge. However, miR-26a is significantly downregulated during IAV infection. Thus, downregulation of miR-26a is a new strategy evolved by IAV to counteract cellular antiviral responses. Our findings indicate that delivery of miR-26a may be a potential strategy for anti-IAV therapies.","536":"Seoul virus (SEOV), which is predominantly carried by Rattus norvegicus, is one of the major causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in China. Hubei province, located in the central south of China, has experienced some of the most severe epidemics of HFRS. To investigate the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-based phylogenetics of wild rats in Hubei, and the relationship with SEOV infection, 664 wild rats were captured from five trapping sites in Hubei from 2000-2009 and 2014-2015. Using reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR, 41 (6.17%) rats were found to be positive for SEOV infection. The SEOV-positive percentage in Yichang was significantly lower than that in other areas. The mtDNA D-loop and cytochrome b (cyt-b) genes of 103 rats were sequenced. Among these animals, 37 were SEOV-positive. The reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship (based on the complete D-loop and cyt-b sequences) allowed the rats to be categorized into two lineages, R. norvegicus and Rattus nitidus, with the former including the majority of the rats. For both the D-loop and cyt-b genes, 18 haplotypes were identified. The geographic distributions of the different haplotypes were significantly different. There were no significant differences in the SEOVpositive percentages between different haplotypes. There were three sub-lineages for the D-loop, and two for cyt-b. The SEOV-positive percentages for each of the sub-lineages did not significantly differ. This indicates that the SEOV-positive percentage is not related to the mtDNA D-loop or cyt-b haplotype or the sub-lineage of rats from Hubei.","537":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that ubiquitously establishes life-long persistence in humans. To ensure its survival and maintain its B cell transformation function, EBV has developed powerful strategies to evade host immune responses. Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful regulators of the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In this review, we summarize current progress on how EBV utilizes miRNAs for immune evasion. EBV encodes miRNAs targeting both viral and host genes involved in the immune response. The miRNAs are found in two gene clusters, and recent studies have demonstrated that lack of these clusters increases the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response of infected cells. These reports strongly indicate that EBV miRNAs are critical for immune evasion. In addition, EBV is able to dysregulate the expression of a variety of host miRNAs, which influence multiple immune-related molecules and signaling pathways. The transport via exosomes of EBV-regulated miRNAs and viral proteins contributes to the construction and modification of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. During EBV immune evasion, viral proteins, immune cells, chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pro-apoptosis molecules are involved. Our increasing knowledge of the role of miRNAs in immune evasion will improve the understanding of EBV persistence and help to develop new treatments for EBV-associated cancers and other diseases.","538":"Human endogenous retrovirus W env (HERV-W env) plays a critical role in many neuropsychological diseases such as schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (MS). These diseases are accompanied by immunological reactions in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia are important immunocytes in brain inflammation that can produce a gasotransmitter-nitric oxide (NO). NO not only plays a role in the function of neuronal cells but also participates in the pathogenesis of various neuropsychological diseases. In this study, we reported increased NO production in CHME-5 microglia cells after they were transfected with HERV-W env. Moreover, HERV-W env increased the expression and function of human inducible nitric oxide synthase (hiNOS) and enhanced the promoter activity of hiNOS. Microglial migration was also enhanced. These data revealed that HERV-W env might contribute to increase NO production and microglial migration ability in neuropsychological disorders by regulating the expression of inducible NOS. Results from this study might lead to the identification of novel targets for the treatment of neuropsychological diseases, including neuroinflammatory diseases, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases.","539":"","540":"","541":"Rabies virus (RABV) is a highly neurotropic virus that follows clathrin-mediated endocytosis and pH-dependent pathway for trafficking and invasion into endothelial cells. Early (Rab5, EEA1) and late (Rab7, LAMP1) endosomal proteins play critical roles in endosomal sorting, maturity and targeting various molecular cargoes, but their precise functions in the early stage of RABV neuronal infection remain elusive. In this study, the relationship between enigmatic entry of RABV with these endosomal proteins into neuronal and SH-SY5Y cells was investigated. Immunofluorescence, TCID50 titers, electron microscopy and western blotting were carried out to determine the molecular interaction of the nucleoprotein (N) of RABV with early or late endosomal proteins in these cell lines. The expression of N was also determined by down-regulating Rab5 and Rab7 in both cell lines through RNA interference. The results were indicative that N proficiently colocalized with Rab5\/EEA1 and Rab7\/LAMP1 in both cell lines at 24 and 48 h post-infection, while N titers significantly decreased in early infection of RABV. Down-regulation of Rab5 and Rab7 did not inhibit N expression, but it prevented productive infection via blocking the normal trafficking of RABV in a low pH environment. Ultrathin sections of cells studied by electron microscope also verified the close association of RABV with Rab5 and Rab7 in neurons. From the data it was concluded that primary entry of RABV strongly correlates with the kinetics of Rab-proteins present on early and late vesicles, which provides helpful clues to explain the early events of RABV in nerve cells.","542":"","543":"Bats carry a variety of viruses, and some of them cause public health problems.

In this study, we collected 1004 samples involving 10 bat species from 7 sites from April 2015 to May 2016, and examined the presence of viruses using nucleic acid-based methods. Coronaviruses, adenoviruses and paramyxoviruses were detected in these samples, with a high prevalence of coronaviruses. While, none was positive for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus or hantavirus.

The objective of this surveillance study was to apply a non-invasive approach using fresh feces to detect viruses circulating within the diverse species of Kenyan bats. We screened for both DNA and RNA viruses; specifically, astroviruses (AstVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), caliciviruses (CalVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), flaviviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses (PMVs), polyomaviruses (PYVs) and rotaviruses. We used family-specific primers, amplicon sequencing and further characterization by phylogenetic analysis. Except for filoviruses, eight virus families were detected with varying distributions and positive rates across the five regions (former provinces) studied. AstVs (12.83%), CoVs (3.97%), PMV (2.4%), ADV (2.26%), PYV (1.65%), CalVs (0.29%), rotavirus (0.19%) and flavivirus (0.19%). Novel CalVs were detected in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Mops condylurus while novel Rotavirus-A-related viruses were detected in Taphozous bats and R. aegyptiacus. The two Rotavirus A (RVA) strains detected were highly related to human strains with VP6 genotypes I2 and I16. Genotype I16 has previously been assigned to human RVA-strain B10 from Kenya only, which raises public health concern, particularly considering increased human-bat interaction. Additionally, 229E-like bat CoVs were detected in samples originating from Hipposideros bats roosting in sites with high human activity.

We also found that it encodes 185 hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs) along with at least 50 amino acids, including 181 ORFs found in other ascoviruses and 4 unique ORFs. Gene-parity plots and phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between HvAV-3h and three other HvAV-3a strains and a distant relationship with Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus 1a (SfAV-1a), Trichoplusia ni ascovirus 6a (TnAV-6a), and Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus 4a (DpAV-4a). Among the 185 potential genes encoded by the genome, 44 core genes were found in all the sequenced ascoviruses. In addition, 25 genes were found to be conserved in all ascoviruses except DpAV-4a. In the HvAV-3h genome, 24 baculovirus repeat ORFs (bros) were present, and the typical homologous repeat regions (hrs) were absent.

Infection by viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), has been speculated to be a potential trigger for RE. However, no viral antigens have been detected in the brains of patients with RE; thus, a possible clinical linkage between viral infections and RE has not been firmly established. In this study, we evaluated the expression of HCMV pp65 antigen in brain sections from 26 patients with RE and 20 non-RE patients by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and assessed the associations between HCMV infection and clinical parameters. Elevated expression of HCMV pp65 protein and DNA was observed in 88.5% (23\/26) and 69.2% (18\/26) of RE cases, respectively. In the non-RE group, HCMV pp65 antigen was detected only in two cases (10%), both of which were negative for DNA staining. Additionally, the intensity of HCMV pp65 staining was correlated with a shorter duration of the prodromal stage, younger age of seizure onset, and more severe unilateral cortical atrophy. Elevated expression of HCMV pp65 was observed in RE brain tissue and was correlated with the clinical features of RE disease. In summary, our results suggested that HCMV infection may be involved in the occurrence and progression of RE disease. Thus, further studies are needed to determine whether early treatment with anti-HCMV antibodies could modulate the course of RE.","558":"Natural killer (NK) cell is a key component of innate immunity and plays an important role in host defense against virus infection by directly destroying infected cells. Influenza is a respiratory disease transmitted in the early phase of virus infection. Evasion of host innate immunity including NK cells is critical for the virus to expand and establish a successful acute infection. Previously, we showed that human influenza H1N1 virus infects NK cells and induces cell apoptosis, as well as inhibits NK cell activity. In this study, we further demonstrated that avian influenza virus also directly targeted NK cells as an immunoevasion strategy. The avian virus infected human NK cells and induced cell apoptosis. In addition, avian influenza virion and HA protein inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity. This novel strategy has obvious advantages for avian influenza virus, allowing the virus sufficient time to expand and subsequent spread before the onset of the specific immune response. Our findings provide an important clue for the immunopathogenesis of avian influenza, and also suggest that direct targeting NK cells may be a common strategy used by both human and avian influenza viruses to evade NK cell immunity.","559":"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a highly pathogenic tick-borne virus with a fatality rate of up to 50% in humans.

Epidemiological surveys have detected CCHFV RNA in ticks and animals; however, few isolates were identified. In this study, we identified and isolated a new CCHFV strain from Hyalomma asiaticum asiaticum ticks collected from north of Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, China. A preliminary investigation of infection and antigens expression of CCHFV was performed in newborn mice. The target tissues for CCHFV replication in newborn mice were identified. The analysis of the phylogenetic relationships with other Chinese strains suggested that diverse genotypes of CCHFV have circulated in Xinjiang for years.

Three new SFTSV strains were isolated from the serum samples of each patient. Characterization of viral growth properties showed that there were no significant differences in virus production. All strains were completely sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis showed that unlike the other strains from Hubei province, which belonged to the SFTSV C3 genotype, one of the three strains belonged to the SFTSV C2 genotype.

In this review, we summarize the recent cases and general properties of SFTS, focusing on the epidemiology, genetic diversity, clinical features, and diagnostics of SFTSV in China. From 2010 to October 2016, SFTS cases were reported in 23 provinces of China, with increased numbers yearly. Infection and death cases are mainly found in central China, where the Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks are spread. The national average mortality rate of SFTS infection was 5.3%, with higher risk to elder people. The main epidemic period was from May to July, with a peak in May.

Assays A and B showed higher sensitivity than assay C for norovirus GI, while they all had the same sensitivity (103 DNA copies\/mL) for GII DNA standard controls. Assay B had the highest efficiency for both genogroups. No cross-reactivity was observed among GI and GII noroviruses, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, and poliovirus. The detection rates of these assays in GI and GII norovirus-positive fecal samples were not significantly different. However, the mean quantification cycle (Cq) value of assay B for GII was lower than assays A and C with statistical significance (P-value, 0.000). All three real-time RT-PCR assays could detect a variety of noroviruses including GI.2, GII.2, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, GII.12, GII.17, and GII.21. This study suggests assay B as a suitable assay for the detection and quantification of noroviruses GI and GII due to good analytical sensitivity and higher performance to amplify norovirus on DNA standard controls and clinical samples.","563":null,"564":"Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae and it is primarily transmitted via Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.

To facilitate further investigation into the structure and function of F protein during virus infection, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F2 subunit of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) (HaF) were generated. Two kinds of mAbs were obtained according to their different recognition epitopes: one kind of mAbs, as represented by 38F10, recognizes amino acid (aa) 85 to 123 of F2 and the other kind, represented by 44D11, recognizes aa 148 to 173 of F2. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay confirmed that both of the mAbs recognized the F protein expressed in HearNPV infected cells, however, only 44D11 could neutralize HearNPV infection. The results further showed that 44D11 may not interact with a receptor binding epitope, rather it was demonstrated to inhibit syncytium formation in cells expressing the HaF protein.

However, it remains unknown whether Ac34 could relocate other Arp2\/3 subunits to the nucleus. In this study, the effects of the viral protein Ac34 on the distribution of these subunits were studied by an immunofluorescence assay. Arp2, P34, P21, and P20 cloned from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells showed mainly cytoplasmic localization and were relocated to the nucleus in the presence of Ac34. In addition, Arp3 was localized in the cytoplasm in both the presence and absence of Ac34, and P16 showed whole-cell localization. In contrast to Sf9 cells, all subunits of mammalian Arp2\/3 showed no nuclear relocation in the presence of Ac34. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the interaction between Ac34 and Arp2\/3 subunits revealed that Ac34 bound to P40, P34, and P20 of Sf9 cells.

This led to the discovery of an interaction between the HIV-1 proteins integrase (IN) and glycoprotein 41 (gp41), which was confirmed by both co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live cells. In addition, it was found that the amino acids at positions 76-100 of gp41 are required for it to bind to IN. Deletion of this region from gp41 prevented its interaction with IN and reduced the production of HIV-1 in 293T cells.

Among these, the human oncogenic herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) exploit the host cell membrane to avoid immune surveillance and promote viral replication. Accumulating evidence has shown that both EBV and KSHV directly encode several similar membrane-associated proteins, including receptors and receptor-specific ligands (cytokines and chemokines), to increase virus fitness in spite of host antiviral immune responses. These proteins are expressed individually at different phases of the EBV\/KSHV life cycle and employ various mechanisms to manipulate the host cell membrane. In recent decades, much effort has been made to address how these membrane-based signals contribute to viral tumorigenesis.

Further analysis showed that similar viruses have been circulating in wild birds in China, Russia, Dubai (Western Asia), Bulgaria and Romania (Europe), as well as domestic poultry in some regions of Africa. The affected areas include the Central Asian, East Asian-Australasian, West Asian-East African, and Black Sea\/Mediterranean flyways. These results show that the novel Clade 2.3.2.1c reassortant viruses are circulating worldwide and may have gained a selective advantage in migratory birds, thus posing a serious threat to wild birds and potentially humans. ","599":"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is one of the most economically important citrus viruses and harms the citrus industry worldwide. To develop reliable and effective serological detection assays of CTV, the major capsid protein (CP) gene of CTV was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using the expression vector pET-28a and purified through Ni+-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was used to immunize BALB\/c mice. Four hybridoma cell lines (14B10, 14H11, 20D5, and 20G12) secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against CTV were obtained through conventional hybridoma technology. The titers of MAb-containing ascitic fluids secreted by the four hybridoma lines ranged from 10(-6) to 10(-7) in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blots showed that all four MAbs could specifically react with CTV CP. Using the prepared MAbs, dot-ELISA, Tissue print-ELISA, and triple antibody sandwich (TAS)-ELISA were developed to detect CTV in tree nurseries and epidemiological studies. The developed dot-ELISA and TAS-ELISA methods could detect CTV in crude extracts of infected citrus leaves with dilutions of 1:2560 and 1:10, 240 (w\/v, g\/mL), respectively. Tissue print-ELISA was particularly useful for large-scale field sample detection, mainly owing to its simplicity and lack of sample preparation requirements. The field survey revealed that CTV is prevalent on citrus trees in the Chongqing Municipality, Jiangxi Province, and Zhejiang Province of China. The coincidence rate of serological and RT-PCR test results reached more than 99.5%. The prepared MAbs against CTV and established sensitive and specific serological assays have a significant role in the detection and prevention and control of CTV in our country.

With increased international travel and business, the possibility of eventually transmitting infectious viruses between different countries is increasing. The most effective approach in preventing viral diseases is vaccination. However, vaccines are not currently available for numerous viral diseases. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are engineered vaccine candidates that have been studied for decades. VLPs are constructed by viral protein expression in various expression systems that promote the selfassembly of proteins into structures resembling virus particles. VLPs have antigenicity similar to that of the native virus, but are non-infectious as they lack key viral genetic material. VLP vaccines have attracted considerable research interest because they offer several advantages over traditional vaccines. Studies have shown that VLP vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, which may offer effective antiviral protection. Here we review recent developments with VLP-based vaccines for several highly virulent emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases. The infectious agents discussed include RNA viruses from different virus families, such as the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Togaviridae families.

The latter two are involved in the suppression of the antiviral innate immune response of the host cell. To contribute to an understanding of this process, we present here the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between MERS-CoV PL(pro) and human ubiquitin (Ub) that is devoid of any covalent linkage between the two proteins. Five regions of the PL(pro) bind to two areas of the Ub. The C-terminal five residues of Ub, RLRGG, are similar to the P5-P1 residues of the polyprotein substrates of the PL(pro) and are responsible for the major part of the interaction between the two macromolecules. Through sitedirected mutagenesis, we demonstrate that conserved Asp165 and non-conserved Asp164 are important for the catalytic activities of MERS-CoV PL(pro). The enzyme appears not to be optimized for catalytic efficiency; thus, replacement of Phe269 by Tyr leads to increased peptidolytic and deubiquitinating activities. Ubiquitin binding by MERS-CoV PL(pro) involves remarkable differences compared to the corresponding complex with SARS-CoV PL(pro). The structure and the mutational study help understand common and unique features of the deubiquitinating activity of MERS-CoV PL(pro).

In this study, the promoters of nine late genes of the betabaculovirus Plutella xylostella granulovirus (PlxyGV) were cloned into a transient expression vector and the alphabaculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) genome, and compared with homologous late gene promoters of AcMNPV in Sf9 cells. In transient expression assays, all PlxyGV late promoters were activated in cells transfected with the individual reporter plasmids together with an AcMNPV bacmid. In infected cells, reporter gene expression levels with the promoters of PlxyGV e18 and AcMNPV vp39 and gp41 were significantly higher than those of the corresponding AcMNPV or PlxyGV promoters, which had fewer late promoter motifs. Observed expression levels were lower for the PlxyGV p6.9, pk1, gran, p10a, and p10b promoters than for the corresponding AcMNPV promoters, despite equal numbers of late promoter motifs, indicating that species-specific elements contained in some late promoters were favored by the native viral RNA polymerases for optimal transcription. The 8-nt sequence TAAATAAG encompassing the ATAAG motif was conserved in the AcMNPV polh, p10, and pk1 promoters. The 5-nt sequence CAATT located 4 or 5 nt upstream of the T\/ATAAG motif was conserved in the promoters of PlxyGV gran, p10c, and pk1. The results of this study demonstrated that PlxyGV late gene promoters could be effectively activated by the RNA polymerase from AcMNPV, implying that late gene expression systems are regulated by similar mechanisms in alphabaculoviruses and betabaculoviruses.

However, in this study, three lineages were identified based on a phylogenetic analysis of all virus sequences from GenBank, including those of the envelope protein (E) and non-structural protein 5 (NS5) coding regions. The spatial and temporal distributions of the three identified ZIKV lineages and the recombination events and mechanisms underlying their divergence and evolution were further elaborated. The potential migration pathway of ZIKV was also characterized. Our findings revealed the central roles of two African countries, Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire, in ZIKV evolution and genotypic divergence. Furthermore, our results suggested that the outbreaks in Asia and the Pacific islands originated from Africa.

However, the genetic characteristics of the transmitted viruses that are preferentially selected have not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed amino acids changes in the envelope protein during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)\/HIV deep transmission history and current HIV evolution within the last 15-20 years. Our results confirmed that the V1V2 region of gp120 protein, particularly V1, was preferentially selected. A shorter V1 region was preferred during transmission history, while during epidemic, HIV may evolve to an expanded V1 region gradually and thus escape immune recognition. We then constructed different HIV-1 V1 mutants using different HIV-1 subtypes to elucidate the role of the V1 region in envelope function. We found that the V1 region, although highly variable, was indispensable for virus entry and infection, probably because V1 deletion mutants exhibited impaired processing of gp160 into mature gp120 and gp41. Additionally, the V1 region affected Env incorporation. These results indicated that the V1 region played a critical role in HIV transmission and infection.

To improve the methods used for the synthesis of long DNA fragments, here we constructed a novel shuttle vector named pGF (plasmid Genome Fast) for DNA assembly in vivo. The BAC plasmid pCC1BAC, which can accommodate large DNA molecules, was chosen as the backbone. The sequence of the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) regulatory element CEN6-ARS4 was synthesized and inserted into the plasmid to enable it to replicate in yeast. The selection sequence HIS3, obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the plasmid pBS313, was inserted for screening. This new synthetic shuttle vector can mediate the transformation-associated recombination (TAR) assembly of large DNA fragments in yeast, and the assembled products can be transformed into Escherichia coli for further amplification.

Thus, a rabies vaccine with high safety and efficacy is urgently needed. Peptide vaccines are known for their low cost, simple production procedures and high safety. Therefore, in this study, we examined the efficacy of multi-epitope-based vaccine candidates against rabies virus. The ability of various peptides to induce epitope-specific responses was examined, and the two peptides that possessed the highest antigenicity and conservation, i.e., AR16 and hPAB, were coated with adjuvant canine-Gp96 and used to prepare vaccines. The peptides were prepared as an emulsion of oil in water (O\/W) to create three batches of bivalent vaccine products. The vaccine candidates possessed high safety. Virus neutralizing antibodies were detected on the day 14 after the first immunization in mice and beagles, reaching 5-6 IU\/mL in mice and 7-9 IU\/mL in beagles by day 28. The protective efficacy of the vaccine candidates was about 70%-80% in mice challenged by a virulent strain of rabies virus.

Six bat species were frequently detected in the cave: Rhinolophus sinicus, Rhinolophus affinis, Hipposideros pomona, Miniopterus schreibersii, Miniopterus fuliginosus, and Miniopterus fuscus. By sequencing PCR products of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp), we found a high frequency of infection by a diverse group of coronaviruses in different bat species in the mineshaft. Sequenced partial RdRp fragments had 80%-99% nucleic acid sequence identity with well-characterized Alphacoronavirus species, including BtCoV HKU2, BtCoV HKU8, and BtCoV1, and unassigned species BtCoV HKU7 and BtCoV HKU10. Additionally, the surveillance identified two unclassified betacoronaviruses, one new strain of SARS-like coronavirus, and one potentially new betacoronavirus species.

However, a leucine-tophenylanine mutation at amino acid 107 of the E protein did not interfere with the production of the infectious virus. These results suggested that all 12 cysteines in the E protein are essential for the JEV life cycle. In summary, a novel reverse genetic system of JEV was established for rapidly introducing mutations into structural genes, which will serve as a useful tool for functional studies.

Using the antigenic protein VP6 as the vector, chimeric proteins carrying foreign epitopes have been shown to possess good immunoreactivity and immunogenicity. In the present study, using modified VP6 as the vector, three chimeric proteins carrying epitopes derived from VP7 of RVA were constructed. The results showed that the chimeric proteins reacted with anti-VP6 and with SA11 and Wa virus strains. Antibodies from guinea pigs inoculated with the chimeric proteins recognized VP6 and VP7 of RVA and protected mammalian cells from SA11 and Wa infection in vitro. The neutralizing activities of the antibodies against the chimeric proteins were significantly higher than those against the vector protein VP6F. Thus, development of chimeric vaccines carrying VP7 epitopes using VP6 as a vector could be a promising alternative to enhance immunization against RVAs. ","667":"Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito borne disease and is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the Asia-Pacific area. The causative agent, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) can be phylogenetically classified into five genotypes based on nucleotide sequence. In recent years, genotype I (GI) has displaced genotype III (GIII) as the dominant lineage, but the mechanisms behind this displacement event requires elucidation. In an earlier study, we compared host variation over time between the two genotypes and observed that GI appears to have evolved to achieve more efficient infection in hosts in the replication cycle, with the tradeoff of reduced infectivity in secondary hosts such as humans. To further investigate this phenomenon, we collected JEV surveillance data on human cases and, together with sequence data, and generated genotype\/case profiles from seven Asia-Pacific countries and regions to characterize the GI\/GIII displacement event. We found that, when comprehensive and consistent vaccination and surveillance data was available, and the GIII to GI shift occurred within a well-defined time period, there was a statistically significant drop in JEV human cases. Our findings provide further support for the argument that GI is less effective in infecting humans, who represent a dead end host. However, experimental investigation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. The study highlights the value of alternative approaches to investigation of epidemics, as well as the importance of effective data collection for disease surveillance and control.

ERVs have coevolved with their hosts over millions of years. Envelope glycoproteins of endogenous retroviruses are often expressed in the mammalian placenta, and their potential function has aroused considerable research interest, including the manipulation of maternal physiology to benefit the fetus. In most mammalian species, trophoblast fusion in the placenta is an important event, involving the formation of a multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer to fulfill essential fetomaternal exchange functions. The key function in this process derives from the envelope genes of endogenous retroviruses, namely syncytins, which show fusogenic properties and placenta-specific expression. This review discusses the important role of the recognized endogenous retrovirus envelope glycoproteins in the mammalian placenta.

Although several anti-HBV drugs have been used clinically, their side and adverse effects limit treatment efficacy. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel potential anti-HBV agents. The flavonol quercetin has shown activity against some retroviruses, but its effect on HBV remains unclear. In the present study, quercetin was incubated with HepG2.2.15 cells, as well as HuH-7 cells transfected with an HBV plasmid. Quercetin was shown to significantly reduce Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), secretion and HBV genomic DNA levels in both cell lines. In addition, co-incubation with lamivudine (3TC), entecavir (ETV), or adefovir (Ade) further enhanced the quercetin-induced inhibition of HBV replication. This inhibition was partially associated with decreased heat shock proteins and HBV transcription levels. The results indicate that quercetin inhibited HBV antigen secretion and genome replication in human hepatoma cell lines, which suggests that quercetin may be a potentially effective anti-HBV agent.

However, their prevalence and genetic diversity in marine and freshwater systems are largely under estimated owing to the immense size of water bodies and limitations in virus discovery techniques. In this study, we conducted a 1-year survey of phytoplankton virus communities by collecting surface water monthly from an inland lake (East Lake) in China between May 2012 and April 2013. We examined four phytoplankton viruses, i.e., myoviruses, podoviruses, siphoviruses, and phycodnaviruses, and seven sets of primers were used to target conserved genes within these four species. In this year-long investigation, a total of 358 different virus-related sequences from four virus families were obtained. All virus families were detected in all months, except for cyanopodoviruses, which were only identified during eight of the 12 months surveyed. Moreover, virus abundance and diversity changed dynamically over time. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of viral sequences from East Lake, China displayed distinct clustering patterns compared with published sequences.

The frequent occurrence of HFMD outbreaks has become a serious public health problem in Asia. Therefore, it is important to understand the pathogenesis and replication of CA16. In this study, a stable infectious cDNA clone of an epidemic strain of Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) was assembled, and subsequently a reporter virus (eGFP-CA16) was constructed by inserting the eGFP gene between the 5'-UTR and the N-terminus of VP4, with the addition of a 2A protease cleavage site (ITTLG) at its C-terminus. This was transfected into Vero cells to generate infectious recombinant viruses. The growth characteristics and plaque morphology, in vitro, in mammalian cells were found to be indistinguishable between the parental and recombinant viruses. Although the eGFP-CA16 showed smaller plaque size as compared to recombinant CA16, both were found to exhibit similar growth trends and EC50 of NITD008. In summary, this stable infectious cDNA clone should provide a valuable experimental system to study CA16 infection and host response. The eGFP-CA16 is expected to provide a powerful tool to monitor eGFP expression in infected cells and to evaluate the antiviral activity of potential antiviral agents in the treatment of CA16 infections.","676":"Human ficolin-2 is an important lectin complement pathway activator that is secreted from liver cells and has been implicated as an anti-infection innate immune molecule. However, the role of ficolin-2 protein and its dynamic changes over the course of and in the prognosis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed ficolin-2 protein expression in a cohort of individuals with CHB infection, HCC and cirrhosis. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to measure serum ficolin-2 concentrations. Ficolin-2 expression in liver tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Serum ficolin-2 concentrations in CHB patients were significantly higher than in healthy controls and HBV carriers. After 48 weeks of routine amelioration liver function treatment, serum ficolin-2 concentrations decreased and were positively correlated with favorable alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBV DNA and HBeAg-seroconversion outcomes. Interestingly, we observed much lower expression of serum and intrahepatic ficolin-2 in HCC and cirrhosis compared with healthy controls.

The RLRs include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. They function to recognize and bind to PAMP motifs within viral RNA in a process that directs the RLR to trigger downstream signaling cascades that induce innate immunity that controls viral replication and spread. Products of RLR signaling also serve to modulate the adaptive immune response to infection.

Active Infections lead to epithelial hyperprolifeation and are usually cleared in healthy individuals within a year. Persistent infections in the anogenital tracts by certain high-risk genotypes such as HPV-16, HPV-18 and closely related types, can progress to high grade dysplasias and carcinomas in women and men, including cervical, vulva, penile and anal cancers. A significant fraction of the head and neck cancers are also caused by HPV-16. The viral oncogenes responsible for neoplastic conversion are E6 and E7 that disrupt the pathways controlled by the two major tumor suppressor genes, p53 and members of pRB family. Because HPV cannot be propagated in conventional submerged monolayer cell cultures, organotypic epithelial raft cultures that generate a stratified and differentiated epithelium have been used to study the viral life cycle.

EBV episomes are detected in almost all NPC cells. The role of EBV in NPC pathogenesis has long been postulated but remains enigmatic. In contrast to infection of B lymphocytes, EBV infection does not directly transform nasopharyngeal epithelial cells into proliferative clones with malignant potential. EBV infection of normal pharyngeal epithelial cells is predominantly lytic in nature. Genetic alterations in premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelium, in combination with inflammatory stimulation in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, presumably play essential roles in the establishment of a latent EBV infection in infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells during the early development of NPC. Establishment of latent EBV infection in premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and expression of latent viral genes, including the BART transcripts and BART-encoded microRNAs, are crucial features of NPC. Expression of EBV genes may drive further malignant transformation of premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells into cancer cells. The difficulties involved in the establishment of NPC cell lines and the progressive loss of EBV epsiomes in NPC cells propagated in culture strongly implicate the contribution of host stromal components to the growth of NPC cells in vivo and maintenance of EBV in infected NPC cells. Defining the growth advantages of EBV-infected NPC cells in vivo will lead to a better understanding of the contribution of EBV infection in NPC pathogenesis, and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for NPC treatment.

Polyomaviruses are a group of small DNA viruses, which have long been studied as a model for eukaryotic DNA replication. Polyomaviruses manipulate host replication proteins, as well as proteins involved in DNA maintenance and repair, to serve as essential cofactors for productive infection. Moreover, evidence suggests that polyomavirus infection poses a unique genotoxic threat to the host cell. In response to any source of DNA damage, cells must initiate an effective DNA damage response (DDR) to maintain genomic integrity, wherein two protein kinases, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), are major regulators of DNA damage recognition and repair. Recent investigation suggests that these essential DDR proteins are required for productive polyomavirus infection.

The hemokinin-1 (HK-1) peptide sequence was used to induce immune responses against the influenza viruses. Five conserved high score cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes restricted to HLA-A*0201-binding peptides within the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the viruses were chosen, and two HA CTL\/HK-1 chimera protein models designed.

Gene regulation has therefore been elucidated in a more detailed fashion. However, viral gene regulation is largely controlled by both cellular and viral components.

Viruses evolve effective strategies against cellular defense in order to achieve replicative success. Whether or not they are successful, cellular defenses remain in the whole viral replication cycle: entry, immediate-early (IE) gene expression, early gene expression, DNA replication, late gene expression, and viral egress.

To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identified via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identified during the human outbreak of 2009, classified as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p.

Only one participant in the drug-naive group had a drug-resistance mutation (M46L), compared with 31.73% of those in whom ART had failed. Further analysis showed that 19.56% of strains contained mutations conferring resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) alone, 0.74% were resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) alone, and 11.44% were dual-resistant to both NRTIs and NNRTIs.

While there are other potential explanations for this large number of human infections with an avian influenza virus, we investigated whether a lack of conserved T-cell epitopes between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and the novel H7N9 virus contributes to this observation.

The extent of conservation between endemic human seasonal influenza and avian influenza H7N9 was comparable to that with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. Thus, the ease of inter-species transmission of H7N9 viruses (compared with avian H5N1 viruses) cannot be attributed to the lack of conservation of such T cell epitopes.

Highly pathogenic PRRSV isolates, with a discontinuous deletion of a 30 amino acid residue in the Nsp2 region, remained the most dominant virus throughout 2007-2012 in China. Owing to the extensive use of representative vaccine strains, natural recombination events occurred between strains.

These findings led to the hypothesis that infection of immuno-incompetent foetuses with K2 confers a status of immunotolerance, and postnatal super-infection with K39 triggers PMWS. To explore this hypothesis, nine 55-day-old foetuses were inoculated in utero (three with K2-10(4.3)TCID50, three with K39-10(4.3)TCID50 and three with medium), and foeto-pathogenicity examined. At 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), K2 did not induce pathology, whereas pathological effects of K39 were evident. Twenty-four 45-day-old foetuses were subsequently inoculated to examine the long-term effect of K2, including six with K2-high dose-10(4.3)TCID50, six with K2-low dose-10(2.3)TCID50 and 12 mock-inoculated controls. Both doses resulted in five mummified foetuses and one live-born piglet each (69dpi). K2 was recovered from all mummies.

Low viral replication was observed in the non-stimulated K2-K39 piglet (up to 10(3.3)TCID50\/g; identified as K39). In contrast, viral replication was extremely high in the stimulated K2-K39 piglet (up to 10(5.6)TCID50\/g) and identified as K2, indicating that K2 infection is controlled during foetal life, but emerges after birth upon immunostimulation.

","800":"The World Health Organization (WHO) standard assay for determining levels of the rabies virus neutralization antibody (RVNA) is the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), which is used to evaluate the immunity effect after vaccination against rabies. For RFFIT, CVS-11 was used as the challenge virus, BSR cells as the adapted cells, and WHO rabies immunoglobulin (WHO STD) as the reference serum in this study. With reference to WHO and Pasteur RFFIT procedures, a micro-RFFIT procedure adapted to our laboratory was produced, and its specificity and reproducibility were tested. We tested levels of RVNA in human serum samples after immunization with different human rabies vaccines (domestic purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV) and imported purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV)) using different regimens (Zagreb regimen and Essen regimen). We analyzed the levels of RVNA, and compared the immune efficacy of domestic PVRV and imported PCECV using different immunization regimens. The results showed that the immune efficacy of domestic PVRV using the Zagreb regimen was as good as that of the imported PCECV, but virus antibodies were generated more rapidly with the Zagreb regimen than with the Essen regimen. The RFFIT procedure established in our laboratory will enhance the comprehensive detection ability of institutions involved in rabies surveillance in China.

The disease is widely distributed in Africa, Asia, and Europe and has developed into a serious public health concern. Humans become infected through the bites of ticks, by contact with a patient with CCHF, or by contact with blood or tissues from viremic livestock. Microvascular instability and impaired hemostasis are the hallmarks of the infection. Infection in human begins with nonspecific febrile symptoms, but may progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with high mortality rates. Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the most used and specific tests for the diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is supportive. Although definitive studies are not available, ribavirin is suggested to be effective especially at the earlier phase of the infection. Uses of universal protective measures are the best way to avoid the infection. In this review, all aspects of CCHF are overviewed in light of the current literature.

However, Huh7 cell line was the only highly permissive cell line for HCV infection and only a few clones were fully permissive. In this study, two different fully permissive clones of Huh7 cells, Huh7.5.1 and Huh7-Lunet-CD81 (Lunet-CD81) cells were compared for their responses upon HCV infection. The virus replication level was found slightly higher in Huh7.5.1 cells than that in Lunet-CD81 cells. Viability of Huh7.5.1 cells but not of Lunet-CD81 cells was reduced significantly after HCV infection. Further analysis showed that the cell cycle of infected Huh7.5.1 cells was arrested at G1 phase. The G1\/S transition was blocked by HCV infection in Huh7.5.1 cells as shown by the cell cycle synchronization analysis. Genes related to cell cycle regulation was modified by HCV infection and gene interaction analysis in GeneSpring GX in Direct Interactions mode highlighted 31 genes. In conclusion, the responses of those two cell lines were different upon HCV infection. HCV infection blocked G1\/S transition and cell cycle progress, thus reduced the cell viability in Huh7.5.1 cells but not in Lunet-CD81 cells. Lunet-CD81 cells might be suitable for long term infection studies of HCV.

These complexes also represent major antigenic targets for anti-viral immune responses. The gC II complex consists of two glycoproteins, gM and gN. In the current study, DNA vaccines expressing the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) homologs of the gM and gN proteins were evaluated for protection against lethal MCMV infection in a mouse model. Humoral and cellular immune responses, spleen viral titers, and mice survival and body-weight changes were examined. The results showed that immunization with gM or gN DNA vaccine alone was not able to offer good protection, whereas co-immunization with both gM and gN induced an effective neutralizing antibody response and cellular immune response, and provided mice with complete protection against a lethal MCMV challenge. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that the gC II (gM-gN) complex may be able to serve as a protective subunit antigen for future HCMV vaccine development.","809":"We developed a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter replicon of West Nile virus (WNV) and used it to quantify viral translation and RNA replication. The advantage of the Gluc replicon is that Gaussia luciferase is secreted into the culture medium from cells transfected with Gluc replicon RNA, and the medium can be assayed directly for luciferase activity. Using a known Flavivirus inhibitor (NITD008), we demonstrated that the Gluc-WNV replicon could be used for antiviral screening. The Gluc-WNV-Rep will be useful for research in antiviral drug development programs, as well as for studying viral replication and pathogenesis of WNV.","810":"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human pathogens including yellow fever virus, dengue virus and West Nile virus. There are currently no effective antiviral therapies for all of the flavivirus and only a few highly effective vaccines are licensed for human use. In this paper, the E protein domain III (DIII) of six heterologous flaviviruses (DENV1-4, WNV and JEV) was expressed in Escherichia coli successfully. The proteins were purified after a solubilization and refolding procedure, characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Competitive inhibition showed that all recombinant flavivirus DIII proteins blocked the entry of JEV into BHK-21 cells. Further studies indicated that antibodies induced by the soluble recombinant flavivirus DIII partially protected mice against lethal JEV challenge. These results demonstrated that recombinant flavivirus DIII proteins could inhibit JEV infection competitively, and immunization with proper folding flavivirus DIII induced cross-protection against JEV infection in mice, implying a possible role of DIII for the cross-protection among flavivirus as well as its use in antigens for immunization in animal models.","811":null,"812":"","813":"An epidemic of Chinese ferret badger-associated human rabies was investigated in Wuyuan county, Jiangxi province and rabies viruses isolates from ferret badgers in different districts in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces were sequenced with their nucleotides and amino acids and aligned for epidemiological analysis. The results showed that the human rabies in Wuyuan are only associated with ferret badger bites; the rabies virus can be isolated in a high percentage of ferret badgers in the epidemic areas in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces; the isolates share the same molecular features in nucleotides and have characteristic amino acid signatures, i.e., 2 sites in the nucleoprotein and 3 sites in the glycoprotein, that are distinct from virus isolates from dogs in the same region.

In order to establish and document the profiles of the respiratory adenovirus pathogen among children in Guangzhou, Southern China, a rapid, simple and practical method for identification and typing of respiratory adenoviruses was developed and evaluated. One pair of universal PCR primers was designed according to the conserved region of the hexon gene, which can detect not only HAdV-B3, -E4 and -B7, but also HAdV-B14, -F40 and -F41, with a specific 300bp PCR product. Three pairs of type-specific PCR primers were also designed according to the hypervariable regions of the hexon gene to type HAdV-B3, -E4 and -B7 by three independent PCR reactions, making it easy to optimize the PCR conditions. By using this method, one hundred throat swab specimens collected during Oct 2010 to Dec 2011 and suspected of being positive for adenoviral infection were identified and typed for adenoviruses. Of these samples, fifty-five were adenovirus-positive. The most common HAdV type was HAdV-B3, identified in 92.7% of samples, which is not only consistent with the data reported in 2004-2006, but also consistent with the recent report in Hangzhou, eastern China, indicating that HAdV-B3 has been circulating in Guangzhou, and maybe in eastern China, for many years. The method for the respiratory adenovirus identification and typing we developed is rapid, simple and practical, which has a potential in the real-time surveillance of circulating adenovirus strains and also to provide etiological evidence for the adenovirus-relative disease control and prevention in China.","817":"Multiplex RT-PCR assays have been widely used tools for detection and differentiation of a panel of respiratory viral pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the Qiagen ResPlex II V2.0 kit and explored factors influencing its sensitivity. Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens were prospectively collected from pediatric inpatients with lower respiratory tract infections at the time of admission in the Shenzhen Children's Hospital from May 2009 to April 2010. Total nucleic acids were extracted using the EZ1 system (Qiagen, Germany) and 17 respiratory viruses and genotypes including influenza A virus (FluA), FluB, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses (RhV), enteroviruses (EnV), human bocaviruses (hBoV), adenoviruses (AdV), four coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), and FluA 2009 pandemic H1N1(H1N1-p) were detected and identified by the ResPlex II kit. In parallel, 16 real-time TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR assays were used to quantitatively detect each virus except for RhV. Influenza and parainfluenza viral cultures were also performed. Among the total 438 NPS specimens collected during the study period, one or more viral pathogens were detected in 274 (62.6%) and 201(45.9%) specimens by monoplex TaqMan RT-PCR and multiplex ResPlex, respectively. When results from monoplex PCR or cell culture were used as the reference standard, the multiplex PCR possessed specificities of 92.9-100.0%. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR for PIV3, hMPV, PIV1 and BoV were 73.1%, 70%, 66.7% and 55.6%, respectively, while low sensitivities (11.1%-40.0%) were observed for FluA, EnV, OC43, RSV and H1N1. Among the seven viruses\/genotypes detected with higher frequencies, multiplex PCR sensitivities were correlated significantly with viral loads determined by the TaqMan RT-PCR in FluA, H1N1-p and RSV (p=0.011-0.000). The Qiagen ResPlex II multiplex RT-PCR kit possesses excellent specificity for simultaneous detection of 17 viral pathogens in NPS specimens in pediatric inpatients at the time of admission. The sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCR was influenced by viral loads, specimen process methods, primer and probe design and amplification condition.","818":"Bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) has a genome organization almost identical to that of SARS-CoV, but the N-terminus of the Spike (S) proteins, which interacts with host receptor and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies against CoVs, of the two viruses has only 63-64% sequence identity. Although there have been reports studying the overall immunogenicity of SSL, knowledge on the precise location of immunodominant determinants for SSL is still lacking. In this study, using a series of truncated expressed SSL fragments and SSL specific mouse sera, we identified two immunogenic determinants for SSL. Importantly, one of the two regions seems to be located in a region not shared by known immunogenic determinants of the SSARS. This finding will be of potential use in future monitoring of SL-CoV infection in bats and spillover animals and in development of more effective vaccine to cover broad protection against this new group of coronaviruses.","819":"More than 40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for a number of disease indications with only one of these (Synagis) - for a viral disease, and not for therapy but for prevention.

The core protein is a variable protein and exists in several sizes. Some sizes of core proteins have been reported to be related to chronic HCV infection. To study the possible role of the core protein in persistent HCV infection, a persistent HCVcc infection was established, and the expression of the core protein was analysed over the course of the infection. The results show that there are three sizes of core proteins (p24, p21 and p19) expressed during the establishment of persistent HCVcc infection. Of these, the p21 core protein is the mature form of the HCV core protein. The p24 core protein is the phosphorylated form of p21. The p19 core protein appears to be a functional by-product generated during the course of infection. These three core proteins are all localized in the cytoplasm and can be encapsidated into the HCV virion. The appearance of the p19 and p24 core proteins might be related to acute HCVcc infection and chronic infection respectively and may play an important role in the pathology of a HCV infection.","821":"","822":"","823":null,"824":"A quantitative real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay with specific primers recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been widely used successfully for detection and monitoring of the pandemic H1N1\/2009 influenza A virus. In this study, we report the design and characterization of a novel set of primers to be used in a qRT-PCR assay for detecting the pandemic H1N1\/2009 virus. The newly designed primers target three regions that are highly conserved among the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of the pandemic H1N1\/2009 viruses and are different from those targeted by the WHO-recommended primers. The qRT-PCR assays with the newly designed primers are highly specific, and as specific as the WHO-recommended primers for detecting pandemic H1N1\/2009 viruses and other influenza viruses including influenza B viruses and influenza A viruses of human, swine, and raccoon dog origin. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR assays with the newly designed primers appeared to be at least 10-fold more sensitive than those with the WHO-recommended primers as the detection limits of the assays with our primers and the WHO-recommended primers were 2.5 and 25 copies of target RNA per reaction, respectively. When tested with 83 clinical samples, 32 were detected to be positive using the qRT-PCR assays with our designed primers, while only 25 were positive by the assays with the WHO-recommended primers. These results suggest that the qRT-PCR system with the newly designed primers represent a highly sensitive assay for diagnosis of the pandemic H1N1\/2009 virus infection.","825":"Influenza A virus poses a great threat to global health, and oseltamivir (trade marked as Tamiflu), which targets influenza surface glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA), is used clinically as a major anti-influenza treatment. However, certain substitutions in NA can render an influenza virus resistant to this drug. In this study, using a lentiviral pseudotyping system, which alleviates the safety concerns of studying highly pathogenic influenza viruses such as avian influenza H5N1, that utilizes influenza surface glycoproteins (hemagglutinin or HA, and NA) and an HIV-core combined with a luciferase reporter gene as a surrogate assay, we first assessed the functionality of NA by measuring pseudovirion release in the absence or presence of oseltamivir. We demonstrated that oseltamivir displays a dose-dependent inhibition on NA activity. In contrast, a mutant NA (H274Y) is more resistant to oseltamivir treatment. In addition, the effects of several previously reported substitution NA mutants were examined as well. Our results demonstrate that this lentivirus-based pseudotyping system provides a quick, safe, and effective way to assess resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. And we believe that as new mutations appear in influenza isolates, their impact on the effectiveness of current and future anti-NA can be quickly and reliably evaluated by this assay.","826":"Filoviruses are hemorrhagic fever viruses endemic to parts of Africa and the Philippines. Infection carries with it a mortality rate of up to 90% and currently there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics available to combat infection. However, the filovirus virus-like particles (VLP), which are currently under development, have been shown to be a promising vaccine candidate. They provide protection from infection in the mouse, guinea pig, and nonhuman primate models of infection, eliciting high anti-glycoprotein antibody titers and T cell responses to viral proteins. In this review, we will highlight the development of the filovirus VLP and describe the current understanding of VLP immunogenicity and correlates of protection.","827":"Shiga toxin B-subunit (STxB) from Shigella dysenteriae targets in vivo antigen to cancer cells, dendritic cells (DC) and B cells, which preferentially express the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor. This pivotal role has encouraged scientists to investigate fusing STxB with other clinical antigens. Due to the challenges of obtaining a functional soluble form of the recombinant STxB, such as formation of inclusion bodies during protein expression, scientists tend to combine STxB with vaccine candidates rather than using their genetically fused forms. In this work, we fused HPV16 E7 as a vaccine candidate to the recombinantly-produced STxB. To minimize the formation of inclusion bodies, we investigated a number of conditions during the expression procedure. Then various strategies were used in order to obtain high yield of soluble recombinant protein from E. coli which included the use of different host strains, reduction of cultivation temperature, as well as using different concentrations of IPTG and different additives (Glycin, Triton X-100, ZnCl(2)). Our study demonstrated the importance of optimizing incubation parameters for recombinant protein expression in E. coli; also showed that the secretion production can be achieved over the course of a few hours when using additives such as glycine and Triton X-100. Interestingly, it was shown that when the culture mediums were supplemented by additives, there was an inverse ratio between time of induction (TOI) and the level of secreted protein at lower temperatures. This study determines the optimal conditions for high yield soluble E7-STxB expression and subsequently facilitates reaching a functionally soluble form of STxB-based vaccines, which can be considered as a potent vaccine candidate for cervical cancer.","828":"","829":"Since the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection was reported in 1997, this highly pathogenic virus has infected hundreds of people around the world and resulted in many deaths. The ability of H5N1 to cross species boundaries, and the presence of polymorphisms that enhance virulence, present challenges to developing clear strategies to prevent the pandemic spread of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus.

The residues D(80)DDG in West Nile virus (WNV) NS2B are important for protease activity. To investigate the effects of D(80)DDG in NS2B on protease activity and viral replication, the negatively charged region D(80)DD and the conserved residue G83 of NS2B were mutated (D(80)DD\/E(80)EE, D(80)DD\/K(80)KK, D(80)DD\/A(80)AA, G83F, G83S, G83D, G83K, and G83A), and NS3 D75A was designated as the negative control. The effects of the mutations on NS2B-NS3 activity, viral translation, and viral RNA replication were analyzed using kinetic analysis of site-directed enzymes and a transient replicon assay. All substitutions resulted in significantly decreased enzyme activity and blocked RNA replication. The negative charge of D(80)DD is not important for maintaining NS2B function, but side chain changes in G83 have dramatic effects on protease activity and RNA replication. These results demonstrate that NS2B is important for viral replication and that D(80)DD and G83 substitutions prevent replication; they will be useful for understanding the relationship between NS2B and NS3.","831":"","832":"","833":"After infection and integration steps, HIV-1 transcriptions increase sharply and singly-spliced mRNAs are produced. These encode Env (gp120 and gp41) and auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpr and VpU. The same localization within the unique structure of the mRNAs suggests that the VpU sequence prior to the Env could affect the Env polyprotein expression.The HIV-1 infection process begins when the gp120 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein complex interacts with its receptor(s) on the target cell. The V3 domain of gp120 is the major determinant of cellular co-receptor binding. According to phenotypic information of HIV-1 isolates, sequences from the VpU to V3 regions (119 in R5- and 120 X4-tropic viruses; one per patient) were analysed. The binomial correlation phi coefficient was used to assess covariation among VpU and gp120(V3) signatures. Subsequently, average linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed. Beyond the classical V3 signatures (R5-viruses: S11, E25D; X4-viruses: S11KR, E25KRQ), other specific V3 and novel VpU signatures were found to be statistically associated with co-receptor usage. Several statistically significant associations between V3 and VpU mutations were also observed. The dendrogram showed two distinct large clusters: one associated with R5-tropic sequences (bootstrap=0.94), involving: (a) H13NP(V3), E25D(V3), S11(V3), T22A(V3) and Q61H(VpU), (b) E25A(V3) and L12F(VpU), (c) D44E(VpU), R18Q(V3) and D80N(VpU); and another associated with X4-tropic sequences (bootstrap=0.97), involving: (i) E25I(V3) and V10A(VpU), (ii) 0-1insV(VpU), H13R(V3), I46L(VpU), I30M(V3) and 60-62del(VpU), (iii) S11KR(V3) and E25KRQ(V3). Some of these pairs of mutations were encoded always by one specific codon.

A total of six goatpox virus (GTPV) and nine sheeppox virus (SPPV) isolates of Indian origin were included in the sequence analysis of the attachment gene. The sequence analysis revealed a high degree of sequence identity among all the Indian SPPV and GTPV isolates at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. Phylogenetic analysis showed three distinct clusters of SPPV, GTPV and Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) isolates. Further, multiple sequence alignment revealed a unique change at G120A in all GTPV isolates resulting in the formation of Dra I restriction site in lieu of EcoR I, which is present in SPPV isolates studied. This change was unique and exploited to develop restriction enzyme specific PCR-RFLP for detection and differentiation of SPPV and GTPV strains. The optimized PCR-RFLP was validated using a total of fourteen (n=14) cell culture isolates and twenty two (n=22) known clinical samples of CaPV. The Restriction Enzyme specific PCR-RFLP to differentiate both species will allow a rapid differential diagnosis during CaPV outbreaks particularly in mixed flocks of sheep and goats and could be an adjunct\/supportive tool for complete gene or virus genome sequencing methods.","835":"","836":"The cellular protein tetherin tethers the HIV-1 viral particles on the cellular membrane to inhibit the replication of HIV-1.

Both retroviral vector plasmids could be packaged in the packaging cell line PT67 to obtain the corresponding retroviruses. The retroviral vector plasmids' functions of tetherin over-expression or vpu-RNAi were detected at the cell level. Retroviral vector plasmids were transfected to PT67 cells at different ratios from 0T3V to 3T0V, and then mixed retroviruses were harvested.

Also, spatial distribution of various FMD serotypes and their comparison is discussed. A total of 590 samples (Epithelial tissue) have been analyzed during a period of five years (2005-2009). Out of 590 samples, 180 were found positive, giving an overall confirmation of FMDV about 33.2 %. Of the prevalent serotypes, FMDV 'O' serotype caused most outbreaks (20.7 %), followed by serotype A (6.6 %) and serotype Asia-1 (4.6 %) while there was no positive case of type 'C'. The study clearly showed that the disease was more frequent in the agro-climatic zones than in hilly areas. Based on the data of 590 samples (&gt;50 outbreaks), the overall prevalence of FMDV in cattle and buffaloes in Pakistan was 33.2 %, while in cattle alone, it was 37.1 %, higher than in buffalo (28.7 %). There were eight cases of mixed serotypes infection, indicating the presence of endemic state of disease. Another significant feature was the change over time. In phase-I (2005-2007), there was an overall prevalence of 29.4 %, while the occurrence of the serotype O, A and Asia-1 was 20.4 %, 2.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. During phase-II (2008-2009), the overall prevalence was 59.21 %, while those of serotype O, A and Asia-1 were 22.4 %, 31.6 % and 4.0 %, respectively.

Comparative analysis showed noticeable disparities of the synonymous codon usage bias in the 21 alphaherpesviruses, indicated by codon adaptation index, effective number of codons (ENc) and GC3s value. The codon usage pattern of PRV US1 gene was phylogenetically conserved and similar to that of the US1-like genes of the genus Varicellovirus of alphaherpesvirus, with a strong bias towards the codons with C and G at the third codon position. Cluster analysis of codon usage pattern of PRV US1 gene with its reference alphaherpesviruses demonstrated that the codon usage bias of US1-like genes of 21 alphaherpesviruses had a very close relation with their gene functions. ENc-plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in PRV US1 gene and the 20 reference alphaherpesviruses was constrained by G+C content, as well as the gene length. In addition, comparison of codon preferences in the US1 gene of PRV with those of E. coli, yeast and human revealed that there were 50 codons showing distinct usage differences between PRV and yeast, 49 between PRV and human, but 48 between PRV and E. coli. Although there were slightly fewer differences in codon usages between E.coli and PRV, the difference is unlikely to be statistically significant, and experimental studies are necessary to establish the most suitable expression system for PRV US1. In conclusion, these results may improve our understanding of the evolution, pathogenesis and functional studies of PRV, as well as contributing to the area of herpesvirus research or even studies with other viruses.","843":"Presently the gold standard diagnostic technique for rabies is the direct immunofluorescence assay (dFA) which is very expensive and requires a high level of expertise. There is a need for more economical and user friendly tests, particularly for use in developing countries. We have established one such test called the direct rapid immunohistochemical test (dRIT) for diagnosis of rabies using brain tissue. The test is based on capture of rabies nucleoprotein (N) antigen in brain smears using a cocktail of biotinylated monoclonal antibodies specific for the N protein and color development by streptavidin peroxidase-amino ethyl carbazole and counter staining with haematoxollin. The test was done in parallel with standard FAT dFA using 400 brain samples from different animals and humans. The rabies virus N protein appears under light microscope as reddish brown particles against a light blue background. There was 100 % correlation between the results obtained by the two tests. Also, interpretation of results by dRIT was easier and only required a light microscope. To conclude, this newly developed dRIT technique promises to be a simple, cost effective diagnostic tool for rabies and will have applicability in field conditions prevalent in developing countries.","844":"Currently, three predominant subtypes of influenza virus are prevalent in pig populations worldwide: H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2. European avian-like H1N1 viruses, which were initially detected in European pig populations in 1979, have been circulating in pigs in eastern China since 2007. In this study, six influenza A viruses were isolated from 60 swine lung samples collected from January to April 2011 in eastern China. Based on whole genome sequencing, molecular characteristics of two isolates were determined. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight genes of the two isolates were closely related to those of the avian-like H1N1 viruses circulating in pig populations, especially similar to those found in China. Four potential glycosylation sites were observed at positions 13, 26, 198, 277 in the HA1 proteins of the two isolates. Due to the presence of a stop codon at codon 12, the isolates contained truncated PB1-F2 proteins. In this study, the isolates contained 591Q, 627E and 701N in the polymerase subunit PB2, which had been shown to be determinants of virulence and host adaptation. The isolates also had a D rather than E at position 92 of the NS1, a marker of mammalian adaptation. Both isolates contained the GPKV motif at the PDZ ligand domain of the 3' end of the NS1, a characteristic marker of the European avian-like swine viruses since about 1999, which is distinct from those of avian, human and classical swine viruses. The M2 proteins of the isolates have the mutation (S31N), a characteristic marker of the European avian-like swine viruses since about 1987, which may confer resistance to amantadine and rimantadine antivirals. Our findings further emphasize the importance of surveillance on the genetic diversity of influenza A viruses in pigs, and raise more concerns about the occurrence of cross-species transmission events.","845":null,"846":null,"847":"Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are causative agents of severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and non-human primates and there is currently no licensed vaccine or therapeutics. To date, there is no specific laboratory diagnostic test in China, while there is a national need to provide differential diagnosis during outbreaks and for instituting acceptable quarantine procedures. In this study, the TaqMan RT-PCR assays targeting the nucleoprotein genes of the Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) and MARV were developed and their sensitivities and specificities were investigated. Our results indicated that the assays were able to make reliable diagnosis over a wide range of virus copies from 10(3) to 10(9), corresponding to the threshold of a standard RNA transcript. The results showed that there were about 10(10) RNA copies per milliliter of virus culture supernatant, equivalent to 10,000 RNA molecules per infectious virion, suggesting the presence of many non-infectious particles. These data indicated that the TaqMan RT-PCR assays developed in this study will be suitable for future surveillance and specific diagnosis of ZEBOV and MARV in China.","848":null,"849":null,"850":"Enterovirus type 71(EV71) causes severe hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) resulting in hundreds of deaths of children every year; However, currently, there is no effective treatment for EV71. In this study, the EV71 poly-protein (EV71-P1 protein) gene was processed and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pPIC9k and then expressed in Pichia pastoris strain GS115. The EV71 P1 protein with a molecular weight of 100 kD was produced and secreted into the medium. The soluble EV71 P1 protein was purified by column chromatography with a recovery efficiency of 70%. The result of the immunological analysis showed that the EV71 P1 protein had excellent immunogenicity and could stimulate the production of EV71-VP1 IgG antibody in injected rabbits. We suggest that EV71-P1 protein is an ideal candidate for an EV71 vaccine to prevent EV71 infection.","851":null,"852":"The envelope protein (Env) of lentiviruses such as HIV, SIV, FIV and EIAV is larger than that of other retroviruses. The Chinese EIAV attenuated vaccine is based on Env and has helped to successfully control this virus, demonstrating that envelope is crucial for vaccine. We compared Env variation of the four kinds of lentiviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the evolutionary relationship of Env between HIV and SIV was the closest and they appeared to descend from a common ancestor, and the relationship of HIV and EIAV was the furthest. EIAV had the shortest Env length and the least number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) as well as glycosylation density compared to various immunodeficiency viruses. However, HIV had the longest Env length and the most PNGS. Moreover, the alignment of HIV and SIV showed that PNGS were primarily distributed within extracellular membrane protein gp120 rather than transmembrane gp41. It implies that the size difference among these viruses is associated with a lentivirus specific function and also the diversity of env. There are low levels of modification of glycosylation sites of Env and selection of optimal protective epitopes might be useful for development of an effective vaccine against HIV\/AIDS.","853":null,"854":"In this study, the decay of maternal peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) antibodies in kids born to goats vaccinated with Asian lineage IV PPR vaccine and the efficacy of passive immunity against PPRV was assessed to determine the appropriate period for vaccination in kids. Serum samples collected from kids born to vaccinated, unvaccinated and infected goats at different time intervals were tested by PPR competitive ELISA and serum neutralization test (SNT). Maternal antibodies in kids were detectable up to 6 months with a decline trend from the third month onwards and receded below the protective level by the fourth month. The kid with an SN titre of 1:8 at the time of immunization showed significant PPRV specific antibody response (percentage inhibition of 76; SN titers &gt;1:16), when tested on 21 day post-vaccination and was completely protected from infection upon virulent PPRV challenge. Similarly, the kid with 1:8 SN titers was completely protected from PPR infection on active challenge. Therefore, PPR vaccination is recommended in kids, aged 4 months and born to immunized or exposed goats. This could be a suitable period to avoid window of susceptibility in kids to PPRV and the effort to eliminate PPR infection from susceptible populations.","855":"Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), together with enterovirus type 71 (EV71), is responsible for most cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Recent findings suggest that the recombination between CVA16 and EV71, and the co-circulation of these two viruses may have contributed to the increase of HFMD cases in China over the past few years. It is therefore important to further understand the virology, epidemiology, virus-host interactions and host pathogenesis of CVA16. In this study, we describe the viral kinetics of CVA16 in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells by analyzing the cytopathic effect (CPE), viral RNA replication, viral protein expression, viral RNA package and viral particle secretion in RD cells. We show that CVA16 appears to first attach, uncoat and enter into the host cell after adsorption for 1 h. Later on, CVA16 undergoes rapid replication from 3 to 6 h at MOI 1 and until 9 h at MOI 0.1. At MOI 0.1, CVA16 initiates a secondary infection as the virions were secreted before 9 h p.i. CPE was observed after 12 h p.i., and viral antigen was first detected at 6 h p.i. at MOI 1 and at 9 h p.i. at MOI 0.1. Thus, our study provides important information for further investigation of CVA16 in order to better understand and ultimately control infections with this virus.","856":"","857":"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a systemic infectious disease caused by Hantaviruses and characterized by fevers, bleeding tendencies, gastrointestinal symptoms and renal failure. It encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from unapparent or mild illnesses to fulminant hemorrhagic processes. Among the various complications of HFRS, acute pancreatitis is a rare find. In this report, based on clinical data, laboratory and radiologic examination findings, we describe a clinical case, with HFRS from Dobrava virus, associated with acute pancreatitis. The patient was successfully treated by supportive management. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of HFRS when examining patients with epidemiological data and symptoms of acute pancreatitis.","858":"The epidemic of rabies has rapidly increased and expanded in Yunnan province in recent years. In order to further analyze and understand the etiological reasons for the rapid expansion of rabies in Yunnan, a strain of rabies virus CYN1009D in Yunnan was isolated, and the complete genomic sequencing was carried out, and the bioimfomative analysis on genes\/encoded proteins and phylogeny with reference to sequences in GenBank was performed. The complete genome of CYN1009D was 11923 nt in length and belonged to genotype I. The genes encoding different structural proteins were all conserved in their lengths, in comparison to other strains in China. The amino acid sequence was conserved at different antigen sites of NP, but the variation was detected at the secondary phosphorylation site of position 375; variations were also detected in the phosphorylation sites at positions 63-63 and 162 of PP; the sites playing important roles in virus synthesis, budding and viral morphology in MP were conserved; two glycosylation sites were detected at Asn37 and Asn319 in GP, the neutralizing antigen sites in GP were conserved; the initial amino acid of LP (ML) was different from that of most of the strains in China (MM); the variations in G-L region in the intergenic region were significant. The phylogenic tree showed that CYN1009D has a closer genetic relationship to the strains in Southeast Asia, indicating that prevention and control on rabies in borderland areas should be reinforced meanwhile efforts are made to control rabies in China.","859":"In recent years (2007 to 2011), although the overall number of rabies cases in China has decreased, there is evidence of emerging or re-emerging cases in regions without previous rabies cases or with low incidence of rabies. To investigate the origin and the factors affecting the spread of rabies in China, specimens were collected from 2007 to 2011 from provinces with emerging and re-emerging cases and tested for the presence of the rabies virus. Positive specimens were combined with sequences from GenBank to perform comparisons of homology and functional sites, and to carry out phylogenetic analyses. Out of these regions, five provinces had 9 positive specimens from canine and cattle, and 34 canine or human specimens were obtained from previously high-incidence provinces. Complete sequences of G gene were obtained for these samples. Homology of the sequences of these 43 specimens was 87%-100% at the nucleotide level and 93.7%-100% at the amino acid level. These G gene sequences were combined with reference sequence from GenBank and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The results showed that 43 specimens were all assigned to China clade I and clade II, with all specimens from emerging and re-emerging areas placed within clade I. Specimens isolated from Shanxi and Inner Mongolia in 2011 were distinct from previously-isolated local strains and had closer homology to strains from Hebei, Beijing and Tianjin whereas new isolates from Shanghai were tightly clustered with strains isolated in the 1990s. Finally, Shaanxi isolates were clustered with strains from adjacent Sichuan. Our results suggest that the rabies cases in emerging and re-emerging areas in China in the last 5 years are a consequence of the epidemic spreading from of neighboring provinces and regions experiencing a serious epidemic of rabies.","860":"The World Health Organization (WHO) standard assay for determining antibody level is the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) and is used to determine the degree of immunity after vaccination against rabies. To compare the difference in RFFIT results between the laboratories of The National Institute of Infectious Disease in Japan (NIID) and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CCDC) as well the influence of the choice of standard serum (STD) for the detection, the two laboratories detection methods were simultaneously manipulated by RFFIT. The reference serums used in NIID and the WHO standard serum used in CCDC were compared in the same RFFIT detection to determine the titer of four sera samples C1, S1, S2 and S4 in parallel, and the titers of the detected sera samples were calculated using the standard formula for neutralizing antibody titer. No significant difference was found in RFFIT methods from the two laboratories and the RFFIT testing procedures of the two laboratories have good consistency. However, different titers were obtained with the tentative internal standard serum (TI-STD) produced by adjusting to 2.0 IU of WHO standard serum in NIID and the WHO STD. The titer determined with the TI-STD was higher than that determined with WHO STD, This difference appears to be significant and requires further investigation.","861":"Arboviruses represent a serious problem to public health and agriculture worldwide. Fast, accurate identification of the viral agents of arbovirus-associated disease is essential for epidemiological surveillance and laboratory investigation. We developed a cost-effective, rapid, and highly sensitive one-step \"triplex RT-PCR enzyme hybridization\" assay for simultaneous detections of Japanese Encephallitis virus (JEV, Flaviviridae), Getah virus (GETV, Togaviridae), and Tahyna virus (TAHV, Bunyaviridae) using three pairs of primers to amplify three target sequences in one RT-PCR reaction. The analytical sensitivity of this assay was 1 PFU\/mL for JEV, 10 PFU\/mL for GETV, and 10 PFU\/mL for TAHV. This assay is significantly more rapid and less expensive than the traditional serological detection and single RT-PCR reaction methods. When \"triplex RT-PCR enzyme hybridization\" was applied to 29 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples that were JEV-positive by normal RT-PCR assay, all samples were strongly positive for JEV, but negative for GETV and TAHV, demonstrating a good sensitivity, specificity, and performance at CSF specimen detection.","862":"To provide a foundation for the development of rapid and specific methods for the diagnosis of rabies virus infection, anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies were prepared and rabies virus nucleoprotein and human rabies virus vaccine strain (PV strain) were used as immunogens to immunize 6-8 week old female BALB\/c mice. Spleen cells and SP2\/0 myeloma cells were fused according to conventional methods: the monoclonal cell strains obtained were selected using the indirect immunofluorescence test; this was followed by preparation of monoclonal antibody ascitic fluid; and finally, systematic identification of subclass, specificity and sensitivity was carried out. Two high potency and specific monoclonal antibodies against rabies virus were obtained and named 3B12 and 4A12, with ascitic fluid titers of 1:8000 and 1:10000, respectively. Both belonged to the IgG2a subclass. These strains secrete potent, stable and specific anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies, which makes them well suited for the development of rabies diagnosis reagents.","863":"Neutralizing antibodies are considered to be an important protective parameter used in HIV-1 vaccine evaluation. However, the exact role that neutralizing antibodies plays in controlling the disease progression of HIV-1 infected peoples is still undetermined. In this paper, we compared the protective function of the neutralizing antibody response in the plasma from LTNP and TP against clade B and clade C pseudoviruses. No difference in the neutralizing activities between the plasma from LTNP and TP was found, which was consistent with the most recent reports. In addition, no correlations between the titer or breadth and CD(4+) or viral load in HIV-1 infected individuals were found. The protective roles played by neutralizing antibodies in controlling disease progression of HIV-1 infected people need to be considered in a new viewpoint.","864":"To investigate molecular epidemiology of DuCV in Cherry Valley ducks in China, the complete genomes of six DuCV strains, which were detected from Cherry Valley ducks in China between 2007 and 2008, were sequenced. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis were carried out to compare these six strains with another 27 DuCV strains from Mulard duck, Muscovy duck, Pekin ducks and Mule duck. The analysis showed that the six DuCV strains exhibited typical genetic features of the family of DuCV, such as a stem-loop structure, three major open reading frames (Rep, Cap and ORF3), four intergenic repeats and the conserved motifs for rolling circle replication and for the dNTP binding domain located in the Rep protein. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the complete genome and Cap gene of these strains together with those that have been previously published demonstrated two distinct DuCV genotypes. The DuCV strains with complete genomes containing 1988 and 1989 nucleotides clustered in genotype A, whereas the strains with complete genomes containing 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1996 nucleotides lay in genotype B. The six DuCV strains from Cherry Valley ducks were divided into the two groups. The results of the study provides some insight into the variation of DuCVs in Cherry Valley ducks.","865":"Influenza virus is a continuous and severe global threat to mankind. The continuously re-emerging disease gives rise to thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses each year, which emphasizes the urgency and necessity to develop high-quality influenza vaccines in a safer, more efficient and economic way. The influenza subunit and VLP vaccines, taking the advantage of recombinant DNA technologies and expression system platforms, can be produced in such an ideal way. This review summarized the recent advancements in the research and development of influenza subunit and VLP vaccines based on the recombinant expression of hemagglutinin antigen (HA), neuraminidase antigen (NA), Matrix 2 protein (M2) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). It would help to get insight into the current stage of influenza vaccines, and suggest the future design and development of novel influenza vaccines.","866":"To analyze features of the rabies epidemic in China between 2007 and 2011, identify factors influencing the epidemic and to provide a scientific basis for further control and prevention of rabies, Descriptive epidemiological methods and statistical analysis was used on data collected from the National Disease Reporting Information System between 2007 to 2011 and the National Active Surveillance System between 2007 and 2010. Our analysis shows that while the number of human rabies cases decreased year by year, the number of districts reporting cases did not show significant change. The situations in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Hunan provinces clearly improved over the period but they remain provinces with high-incidence, and consequently influence the epidemic situation of surrounding provinces and possibly the whole country. Summer and autumn were high-incidence seasons. Farmers, students and pre-school children represent the high-risk populations, and rates of cases in farmers increased, those for students decreased, and pre-school children remained unchanged. Provinces with active surveillance programs reported a total of 2346 individual cases, of which 88.53% were associated with canines. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of rabies cases was not significantly improved, whereas PEP in post-exposure population was good. In rural regions of China, canine density was reduced somewhat, and the immunization rate increased slightly. Finally we show that while the epidemic decreased 2007 to 2011 in China, cases continued to be diffused in certain regions. Lack of standardization of PEP on rabies cases was the main reason of morbidity. The high density and low immunization of dog in rural areas and the defective situation of PEP are still continuous occurrences in China and remain a cause for concern.","867":null,"868":"The means of survival of genomic dsRNA of reoviruses from dsRNA-triggered and Dicer-initiated RNAi pathway remains to be defined. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) replication on the RNAi pathway of grass carp kidney cells (CIK). The dsRNA-triggered RNAi pathway was demonstrated unimpaired in CIK cells through RNAi assay. GCRV-specific siRNA was generated in CIK cells transfected with purified GCRV genomic dsRNA in Northern blot analysis; while in GCRV-infected CIK cells, no GCRV-specific siRNA could be detected. Infection and transfection experiments further indicated that replication of GCRV correlated with the increased transcription level of the Dicer gene and functional inhibition of in vitro synthesized egfp-siRNA in silencing the EGFP reporter gene. These data demonstrated that although only the genomic dsRNA of GCRV was sensitive to the cellular RNAi pathway, unidentified RNAi suppressor protein(s) might contribute to the survival of the viral genome and efficient viral replication.","869":"Rice stripe virus (RSV) infects rice and is transmitted in a propagative manner by the small brown planthopper. How RSV enters an insect cell to initiate the infection cycle is poorly understood. Sequence analysis revealed that the RSV NSvc2 protein was similar to the membrane glycoproteins of several members in the family Bunyaviridae and might induce cell membrane fusion. To conveniently study the membrane fusion activity of NSvc2, we constructed cell surface display vectors for expressing Nsvc2 on the insect cell surface as the membrane glycoproteins of the enveloped viruses. Our results showed that NSvc2 was successfully expressed and displayed on the surface of insect Sf9 cells. When induced by low pH, the membrane fusion was not observed in the cells that expressed NSvc2. Additionally, the membrane fusion was also not detected when co-expressing Nsvc2 and the viral capsid protein on insect cell surface. Thus, RSV NSvc2 is probably different from the phlebovirus counterparts, which could suggest different functions. RSV might enter insect cells other than by fusion with plasma or endosome membrane.","870":null,"871":"Endogenous beta retroviruses (enJSRV) are highly homologous with Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (exJSRV), this exogenous retrovirus is the aetiological agent of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). The aim of this study was to clarify the function of enJSRV and the immunological mechanisms of its corresponding antibody, that is undetectable in JSRV-infected ovine serum. The expression of enJSRV envelope protein and Hyal-2 mRNA in immune organs and lungs of ovine fetuses and lambs were analyzed by Real-Time reverse transcription PCR and In Situ Hybridization using specific probes. In Situ Hybridization results indicated that the enJSRV envelope protein and Hyal-2 mRNA were expressed in thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and lungs at different times, while no positive signals were detected in the negative controls. On the other hand, results from Real-Time reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that in 130d fetuses and 3d newborn lambs the enJSRV mRNA levels were much higher in organs associated with the immune system than that in lungs, especially in the thymus and spleen, but levels of Hyal-2 mRNA expression was not significantly different in all collected tissue. These results provided evidence from an immunology point of view to understand why the circulating antibodies against exJSRV are undetectable in JSRV-infected ovine, and will help to unravel the pathogenesis of JSRV-infected ovine.","872":"As a protein expression vector, the baculovirus demonstrates many advantages over other vectors. With the development of biotechnology, baculoviral vectors have been genetically modified to facilitate high level expression of heterologous proteins in both insect and mammalian cells. These modifications include utilization of different promoters and signal peptides, deletion or replacement of viral genes for increasing protein secretion, integration of polycistronic expression cassette for producing protein complexes, and baculovirus pseudotyping, promoter accommodation or surface display for enhancing mammalian cell targeting gene delivery. This review summarizes the development and the current state of art of the baculovirus expression system. Further development of baculovirus expression systems will make them even more feasible and accessible for advanced applications.","873":"Protamines are a group of highly basic proteins first discovered in spermatozoon that allow for denser packaging of DNA than histones and will result in down-regulation of gene transcription[1]. It is well recognized that the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) encodes P6.9, a protamine-like protein that forms the viral subnucleosome through binding to the viral genome[29]. Previous research demonstrates that P6.9 is essential for viral nucleocapsid assembly, while it has no influence on viral genome replication[31]. In the present study, the role of P6.9 in viral gene transcription regulation is characterized. In contrast to protamines or other protamine-like proteins that usually down-regulate gene transcription, P6.9 appears to up-regulate viral gene transcription at 12-24 hours post infection (hpi), whereas it is non-essential for the basal level of viral gene transcription. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the P6.9's co-localization with DNA is temporally and spatially synchronized with P6.9's impact on viral gene transcription, indicating the P6.9-DNA association contributes to transcription regulation. Chromatin fractionation assay further reveals an unexpected co-existence of P6.9 and host RNA polymerase II in the same transcriptionally active chromatin fraction at 24 hpi, which may probably contribute to viral gene transcription up-regulation in the late infection phase.","874":"The major immunogenic proteins (E(rns), E2 and NS3) of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (Shimen strain) were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The recombinant antigens were applied to develop multiple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of specific antibodies in pig sera. Optimum cut-off values were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis after testing 201 sera of vaccinated pigs and 64 negative sera of unvaccinated piglets. The multiple ELISAs were validated with 265 pig sera yielding high sensitivity and specificity in comparison with the virus neutralization results. The results demonstrated that multiple ELISAs can be a valuable tool for the detection of CSFV infection and serological surveys in CSFV-free countries or for the evaluation of the antibody responses in pigs induced by a live attenuated C-strain vaccination.","875":"Host genes involved in lipid metabolism are differentially affected during the early stages of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here we demonstrate that artificial up-regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis has a positive effect on the replication of the HCV full-length replicon when cells were treated with nystatin. Conversely, the HCV RNA replication was decreased when fatty acid biosynthesis was inhibited with 25-hydroxycholesterol and PDMP(D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol). In agreement with these results, the expression level of GlcT-1(ceramide glucosyltransferase), a host glucosyltransferase in the first step of GSL (glycosphingolipid) biosynthesis, was found to be closely associated with the expression and replication of HCV RNA. On the other hand, the viral RNA can also activate GlcT-1 in the early stage of viral RNA transfection in vitro. To identify viral factors that are responsible for GlcT-1 activation, we constructed ten stable Vero cell lines that express individual HCV proteins. Based on the analyses of these cell lines and transient transfection assay of the GlcT-1 promoter regions, we conclude that HCV proteins, especially NS5A and NS5B, have positive effects on the expression of GlcT-1. It is possible that NS5A and NS5B stimulate transcription factor(s) to activate the expression of GlcT-1 by increasing its transcription level.","876":"Bovine Herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is distributed worldwide and is a major pathogen in cattle, being the causal agent of a variety of clinical syndromes. The aim of this study was to isolate and to characterize (molecular and biological characterization) BoHV-1 from 29 immunosuppressed animals. It was possible to obtain 18 isolates, each from a different animal, such as from the respiratory and reproductive tracts. In some cases the cytopathic effect was visible 12 hours post-inoculation, and became characteristic after 36-48 hours. Biological characteristics were evaluated and compared with Iowa and Colorado-1 reference strains, and differences were found in plaque size, virus titer measured by TCID50 and PFU\/mL, and one step virus curves. These results showed that some isolates had a highly virulent-like behavior in vitro, compared to the reference strains, with shorter eclipse periods, faster release of virus into the supernatants, and higher burst size and viral titer. There were no differences in glycoprotein expression of BoHV-1 isolates, measured by Western blot on monolayers. Moreover, using restriction endonucleases analysis, most of the viruses were confirmed as BoHV-1.1 and just one of them was confirmed as BoHV-1.2a subtype. These findings suggest that some wild-type BoHV-1 isolates could be useful as seeds to develop new monovalent vaccines.","877":null,"878":"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a member of the Entero-virus genus of the Picornaviridae family and is the major cause of Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. Different strains from Gansu were cloned and the P1 protein was sequenced and analysed. Results indicate that there are three kinds of EV71 infections prevalent in Gansu. The VP1 protein from one of these strains, 55F, was expressed. The recombinant protein was expressed with high level and reacted specifically with the EV71 patient antibody, the recombinant protein was also applied to raise antiserum in rabbits and after the fourth injection a high titer of antiserum was detected by ELISA assay. These data are useful for further clarification of prevalent EV71 strains in the north of China at the molecular level and provide a basis for EV71 diagnosis.","879":null,"880":null,"881":"A bacterial cell surface display technique based on an ice nucleation protein has been employed for the development of live vaccine against viral infection. Due to its ubiquitous ability to invade host cells, Salmonella typhimurium might be a good candidate for displaying viral antigens. We demonstrated the surface display of domain III of Japanese encephalitis virus E protein and the enhanced green fluorescent protein on S. typhimurium BRD509 using the ice nucleation protein. The effects of the motif in the ice nucleation protein on the effective display of integral protein were also investigated. The results showed that display motifs in the protein can target integral foreign protein on the surface of S. typhimurium BRD509. Moreover, recombinant strains with surface displayed viral proteins retained their invasiveness, suggesting that the recombinant S. typhimurium can be used as live vaccine vector for eliciting complete immunogenicity. The data may yield better understanding of the mechanism by which ice nucleation protein displays foreign proteins in the Salmonella strain.","882":"The ubiquitin-like modifier bISG15 is an antiviral protein found in fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells. Bovine Herpesvirus 1(BHV-1), which is a viral pathogen of cattle, can infect FBL cells and induce cytopathic effects. Real-time PCR assays showed that BHV-1's infection could repress the basal or inducible transcription of bISG15 in FBL cells. It demonstrates that this repression effect depends on BHV-1 viral infection and new protein synthesis. Our previous work showed that bIRF-3 was the key factor in the stimulation of bISG15 in FBL cells, so the effect of BHV-1 viral protein on bIRF-3 activating the promoter of bISG15 was confirmed. The luciferase assay showed the BHV-1 viral protein bICP0 inhibited the activation of bISG15 promoter stimulated by bIRF-3. Taken together, our work suggested that BHV-1 had some molecular mechanism to resist the cellular bISG15's antiviral functions.","883":"Banana streak virus (BSV), a member of genus Badnavirus, is a causal agent of banana streak disease throughout the world. The genetic diversity of BSVs from different regions of banana plantations has previously been investigated, but there are relatively few reports of the genetic characteristic of episomal (non-integrated) BSV genomes isolated from China. Here, the complete genome, a total of 7722bp (GenBank accession number DQ092436), of an isolate of Banana streak virus (BSV) on cultivar Cavendish (BSAcYNV) in Yunnan, China was determined. The genome organises in the typical manner of badnaviruses. The intergenic region of genomic DNA contains a large stem-loop, which may contribute to the ribosome shift into the following open reading frames (ORFs). The coding region of BSAcYNV consists of three overlapping ORFs, ORF1 with a non-AUG start codon and ORF2 encoding two small proteins are individually involved in viral movement and ORF3 encodes a polyprotein. Besides the complete genome, a defective genome lacking the whole RNA leader region and a majority of ORF1 and which encompasses 6525bp was also isolated and sequenced from this BSV DNA reservoir in infected banana plants. Sequence analyses showed that BSAcYNV has closest similarity in terms of genome organization and the coding assignments with an BSV isolate from Vietnam (BSAcVNV). The corresponding coding regions shared identities of 88% and -95% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated BSAcYNV shared the closest geographical evolutionary relationship to BSAcVNV among sequenced banana streak badnaviruses.","884":"This study aimed to evaluate emerging trends of drug resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) among 290 former blood donor HIV-1 infected patients in Hubei, China, from 2004 to 2006, all of whom had received anti-HIV-1 therapy. The presence of NRTI- and NNRTI-associated mutations were established by sequencing; genotypic and predicted phenotypic drug resistance were evaluated using HIVdb Program version 5.0.1 (http:\/\/hivdb.stanford.edu\/pages\/algs\/HIVdb.html ). Genotypic drug resistance analysis showed significant increases in percentages of patients carrying HIV-1 strains with M41L, T215Y\/F, D67N, K103N, G190A\/S, Y181C\/F or L210W mutations. Of the variants' predicted phenotypic drug resistance, highly significant increases were detected in percentages of patients carrying HIV-1 with high resistance to zidovudine (AZT) or stavudine (D4T) in NRTIs, and to delavirdine (DLV), efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP) in NNRTIs; intermediate resistance to abacavir (ABC), AZT, D4T, didanosine (DDI) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in NRTIs, and to etravirine (ETR) in NNRTIs; and low and potential low resistance to lamivudine (3TC), ABC, emtricitabine (FTC) or TDF in NRTIs, and to ETR in NNRTIs.","885":"Although the important role of the non-structural (NS1 and NEP) gene of influenza A in virulence of the virus is well established, our knowledge about the extent of variation in the NS gene pool of influenza A viruses in their natural reservoirs in Kazakhstan is incomplete. 17 influenza A viruses of different subtypes were studied in this paper. Seven types of haemagglutinin and five different neuraminidase subtypes in eight combinations were found among the isolated viruses. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of isolated viruses revealed a substantial number of silent mutations, which results in high degree of homology in amino acid sequences. By phylogenetic analysis it was shown that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A with 5 Clades and B, were present at the same time in Kazakhstan. The degree of variation within the alleles was very low. In our study allele A viruses had a maximum of 5% amino acid divergence in Clade while allele B viruses had only 4% amino acid divergence.","886":"Caspases are an evolutionarily conserved family of aspartate-specific cystein-dependent proteases with essential functions in apoptosis and normally exist in cells as inactive proenzymes. In addition to the inflammatory caspases, the initiator and effector caspases have been shown to have an important role in regulating the immune response, but are involved in different ways. We give a brief introduction on the benefit of apoptosis on the clearance of invasive pathogens, and the caspase functions involved in the immune response. Then we construct a working model of caspases during pathogen invasion. A detailed description of the three modes is given in the discussion. These three modes are regulated by different inhibitors, and there may be a novel way to treat intracellular pathogen and autoimmune diseases based on the specific inhibitors.","887":"Many plants contain ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) with N-glycosidase activity, which depurinate large ribosomal RNA and arrest protein synthesis. RIPs so far tested inhibit replication of mRNA as well as DNA viruses and these proteins, isolated from plants, are found to be effective against a broad range of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Most of the research work related to RIPs has been focused on antiviral activity against HIV; however, the exact mechanism of antiviral activity is still not clear. The mechanism of antiviral activity was thought to follow inactivation of the host cell ribosome, leading to inhibition of viral protein translation and host cell death. Enzymatic activity of RIPs is not limited to depurination of the large rRNA, in addition they can depurinate viral DNA as well as RNA. Recently, Phase I\/II clinical trials have demonstrated the potential use of RIPs for treating patients with HIV disease. The aim of this review is to focus on various RIPs from plants associated with anti-HIV activity.","888":"The function of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) UL4 protein is still elusive. Our objective is to investigate the subcellular transport mechanism of the UL4 protein. In this study, fluorescence microscopy was employed to investigate the subcellular localization of UL4 and characterize the transport mechanism in living cells. By constructing a series of deletion mutants fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), the nuclear export signals (NES) of UL4 were for the first time mapped to amino acid residues 178 to 186. In addition, the N-terminal 19 amino acids are identified to be required for the granule-like cytoplasmic pattern of UL4. Furthermore, the UL4 protein was demonstrated to be exported to the cytoplasm through the NES in a chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner involving RanGTP hydrolysis.","889":"Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) is a tick-born virus of the Nairovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family, which is widespread and causes high fatality. The nucleocapsid of CCHFV is comprised of N proteins that are encoded by the S segment. In this research, the N protein of CCHFV was expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. Under an electron microscope, Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) with various size and morphology were observed in cytoplasmic vesicles in the infected cells. Sucrose-gradient purification of the cell lysate indicated that the VLPs were mainly located in the upper fraction after ultracentrifugation, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immuno-electron microscopy (IEM).","890":null,"891":"In order to improve the accuracy for quantitating the bovine foamy virus (BFV) in vitro, we developed a baby hamster kidney cell (BHK)-21-derived indicator cell line containing a plasmid that encodes the firefly luciferase driven by the BFV long terminal repeat promoter (LTR, from -7 to 1012). The BFV titer could be determined by detecting the luciferase expression since the viral trans-activator BTas protein activates the promoter activity of the LTR. One clone, designated BFVL, was selected from ten neomycin-resistant clones. BFVL showed a specific and inducible dose- and time-dependent luciferase activity in response to BFV infection. Although the changes in luciferase activity of BFVL peaked at 84 h post infection, it was possible to differentiate infected and uninfected cells at 48 h post infection. A linear relationship was established between the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of BFV and the activated ratio of luciferase expression in BFVL. Moreover, the sensitivity of the BFVL-based assay for detecting infectious BFV was 10,000 times higher than the conventional CPE-based assay at 48 h post infection. These findings suggest that the BFVL-based assay is rapid, easy, sensitive, quantitative and specific for detection of BFV infection.","892":"The aim of the work is the comparison of the epidemiology of influenza and acute respiratory virus infections (ARVI) in the Republic of Kazakhstan with the corresponding influenza epidemic in Russia induced by influenza pandemic virus A\/California\/07\/2009 in 2009. Data on influenza and ARVI from the Republic of Kazakhstan and Federal Center of influenza was collected and investigated over the course of several weeks from hospitalized patients with the same diagnosis among all population and in age groups on 16 territories of Kazakhstan and in 49 major cities of Russia. The epidemic in Kazakhstan resembled the Russian epidemic in terms of its abnormally early beginning, expression of monoaetiology, the spread of the epidemic into all territories and start of the epidemics among adult population. High percentage of hospitalized people and lethal outcome were registered in this epidemic. Similarity of epidemic process character in corresponding border-line territories of both countries was found out.","893":"It is well known that Tn5B1-4 (commercially known as the High Five) cell line is highly susceptible to baculovirus and provides superior production of recombinant proteins when compared to other insect cell lines. But the characteristics of the cell line do not always remain stable and may change upon continuous passage. Recently an alphanodavirus, named Tn5 Cell Line Virus (or TNCL Virus), was identified in High Five cells in particular. Therefore, we established a new cell line, QB-Tn9-4s, from Trichoplusia ni, which was determined to be free of TNCL virus by RT-PCR analysis. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel cell clone, QB-CL-B, from a low passage QB-Tn9-4s cell line and report its susceptibility to AcMNPV, and the level of recombinant protein production. This cell clone was similar to its parental cells QB-Tn9-4s and Tn5B1-4 cells in morphology and growth rate; although it also showed approximately the same responses to AcMNPV infection and production of occlusion bodies, there were higher levels of recombinant protein production in comparison to QB-Tn9-4s (parental cells) and High5 cells.","894":null,"895":"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a disease caused by viruses of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus. HFRS from Dobrava virus (DOBV) is a seldom reported disease in Albania. Clinically HFRS is manifested as mild, moderate, or severe. Therefore, the number of cases of Hantavirus' infection may be underestimated, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of many acute infections, hematologic diseases, acute abdominal diseases and renal diseases complicated by acute renal failure. We report here an atypical presentation of HFRS from Dobrava virus complicated by orchitis with a positive outcome.","896":"Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), family Nanaviridae, genus Babuvirus, is a single stranded DNA virus (ssDNA) that causes banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) in banana plants. It is the most common and most destructive of all viruses in these plants and is widespread throughout the Asia-Pacific region. In this study we isolated, cloned and sequenced a BBTV sample from Hainan Island, China. The results from sequencing and bioinformatics analysis indicate this isolate represents a satellite DNA component with 12 DNA sequences motifs. We also predicted the physical and chemical properties, structure, signal peptide, phosphorylation, secondary structure, tertiary structure and functional domains of its encoding protein, and compare them with the corresponding quantities in the replication initiation protein of BBTV DNA1.","897":null,"898":"In this study, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus(PRRSV), named as 8C9 and4B4, were produced by fusing SP2\/0 myeloma cells and spleen cells of BALB\/c mice immunized with the PRRSV (TCID(50)=5.5), screened by the indirect ELISA and subjected to several limiting dilutions. mAbs were then identified by biological characterization. Among the two fusion cell strains, 8C9 belonged to the IgG1 subclass and 4B4 belonged to the IgG2a subclass. The titers in cell culture supernatant and abdomen liquor reached to 1:10(4)and 1:10(5), respectively. The specificity test indicated that the two cells had specific reactions for the PRRSV and GP5 protein respectively, and no reaction with Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) or Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV). The molecular weights of the heavy chain and light chain were about 45.0 kDa and 25.0 kDa, respectively. In neutralization activity tests, the results showed that the prepared mAb 4B4 can protect 50% of cells with no CPE in dilution up to 1:512, but mAB 8C9 has no neutralization activities to PRRSV.","899":"The gene encoding the VP28 envelope protein of White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was cloned into expression vector pET-30a and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21. After induction, the recombinant VP28 (rVP28) protein was purified and then used to immunize Balb\/c mice for monoclonal antibody (MAb) production. It was observed by immuno-electron microscopy the MAbs specific to rVP28 could recognize native VP28 target epitopes of WSSV and dot-blot analysis was used to detect natural WSSV infection. Competitive PCR showed that the viral level was approximately 10(4) copies\/mg tissue in the dilution of gill homogenate of WSSV-infected crayfish at the detection limit of dot-blot assay. Our results suggest that dot-blot analysis with anti-rVP28 MAb could rapidly and sensitively detect WSSV at the early stages of WSSV infection.","900":null,"901":"Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational modification processes that play an essential role in regulating protein functionality. The Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) orf2-encoded nucleocapsid protein HA2 participates in orchestration of virus-induced actin polymerization through its WCA domain, in which phosphorylation status are supposed to be critical in respect to actin polymerization. In the present study, two putative phosphorylation sites ((232)Thr and (250)Ser) and a highly conserved Serine ((245)Ser) on the WCA domain of HA2 were mutated, and their phenotypes were characterized by reintroducing the mutated HA2 into the HearNPV genome. Viral infectivity assays demonstrated that only the recombinant HearNPV bearing HA2 mutation at (245)Ser can produce infectious virions, both (232)Thr and (250)Ser mutations were lethal to the virus. However, actin polymerization assay demonstrated that all the three viruses bearing HA2 mutations were still capable of initiating actin polymerization in the host nucleus, which indicated the putative phosphorylation sites on HA2 may contribute to HearNPV replication through another unidentified pathway.","902":"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe illness with high fatality. Cases are reported in several countries in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Phylogenetic analyses based on the virus S (nucleocapsid), M (glycoprotein), and L (polymerase) genome segments sequences indicate distinct geographic lineages exist but their specific genetic characteristics require elucidation. In this work we collected all full length S segment sequences and generated a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of these 62 samples. We then analyzed the alignment using entries from AAIndex, the Amino Acid Index database, to identify amino acid mutations that performed significant changes in charge, pka, hydropathy and side chain volume. Finally, we mapped these changes back to the tree and alignment to identify correlated mutations or sites that characterized a specific lineage. Based on this analysis we are able to propose a number of sites that appear to be important for virus function and which would be good candidates for experimental mutational analysis studies.","903":"Hand foot and mouth disease is a febrile sickness complex characterized by cutaneous eruption (exanthem) on the palms and soles with simultaneous occurrence of muco-cutanous vesiculo-ulcerative lesions (enanthem) affecting the mouth. The illness is caused by a number of enteroviruses with coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71 as the main causative agents. Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) belongs to the species Human enterovirus A under the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. EV71 has been associated with an array of clinical diseases including hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis. A large outbreak of HFMD due to highly neurovirulent EV71 emerged in Malaysia in 1997, and caused 41 deaths amongst young children. In late 2000, a recurrence of an outbreak of HFMD occurred in Malaysia with 8 fatalities in peninsular Malaysia. Outbreak of HFMD due to EV71 recurred in 2003 with an unknown number of cases and mortalities. A similar outbreak of HFMD with 2 recorded deaths in young children occurred in peninsular Malaysia in late 2005 and this was followed by a larger outbreak in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) with 6 reported fatalities in the early part of 2006. The current on-going outbreak of HFMD started in peninsular Malaysia in epidemiological week 12 of 2010. As with other HFMD outbreaks in Malaysia, both EV71 and CA16 were the main aetiological viruses isolated. In similarity with the HFMD outbreak in 2005, the isolation of CA16 preceded the appearance of EV71. Based on the VP1 gene nucleotide sequences, 4 sub-genogroups of EV71 (C1, C2, B3 and B4) co-circulated and caused the outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in peninsular Malaysia in 1997. Two sub-genogroups (C1 and B4) were noted to cause the outbreak in 2000 in both peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. EV71 of sub-genogroup B5 with smaller contribution from sub-genogroup C1 caused the outbreak in 2003. In the 2005 outbreak, besides the EV71 strains of sub-genogroup C1, EV71 strains belonging to sub-genogroup B5 were isolated but formed a cluster which was distinct from the EV71 strains from the sub-genogroup B5 isolated in 2003. The four EV71 strains isolated from clinical specimens of patients with hand, foot and mouth disease in the Sarawak outbreak in early 2006 also belonged to sub-genogroup B5. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene suggests that the EV71 strains causing the outbreak in Sarawak could have originated from peninsular Malaysia. Epidemiological and molecular data since 1997 show the recurrence of HFMD due to EV71 in Malaysia every 2 to 4 years. In each of the past outbreaks, more than one sub-genogroup of the virus co-circulate.","904":null,"905":"An optimized recombinant HPV16 E6E7 fusion gene (HPV16 ofE6E7) was constructed according to codon usage for mammalian cell expression, and a mutant of HPV16 ofE6E7 fusion gene (HPV16 omfE6E7) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis at L57G, C113R for the E6 protein and C24G, E26G for the E7 protein for HPV16 ofE6E7 [patent pending (CN 101100672)]. The HPV16 omfE6E7 gene constructed in this work not only lost the transformation capability to NIH 3T3 cells and tumorigenicity in SCID mice, but also maintained very good stability and antigenicity. These results suggests that the HPV16 omfE6E7 gene should undergo further study for application as a safe antigen-specific therapeutic vaccine for HPV16-associated tumors.","906":null,"907":"To develop a safe and efficient recombinant subunit vaccine to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type Asia 1 in sheep, a tandem repeated multiple-epitope gene consisting of residues 137-160 and 197-211 of the VP1 gene of FMDV was designed and artificially synthesized. The biologically functional molecule, the ovine IgG heavy constant region (oIgG) as a protein carrier was introduced for design of the multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine and recombinant expression plasmids pET-30a-RE and pET-30a-RE-oIgG were successfully constructed. The recombinant proteins, RE and RE-oIgG, were expressed as a formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli. The immune potential of this vaccine regime in guinea pigs and sheep was evaluated. The results showed that IgG could significantly enhance the immune potential of antigenic epitopes. The recombinant protein RE-oIgG could not only elicit the high levels of neutralizing antibodies and lymphocytes proliferation responses in the vaccinated guinea pigs, but confer complete protection in guinea pigs against virus challenge. Although the recombinant protein RE could not confer protection in the vaccinated animals, it could delay the appearance of the clinical signs and reduce the severity of disease. Inspiringly, the titers of anti-FMDV neutralizing antibodies elicited in sheep vaccinated with RE-oIgG was significantly higher than that for the RE vaccination. Therefore, we speculated that this vaccine formulation may be a promising strategy for designing a novel vaccine against FMDV in the future.","908":"Torque teno virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped virus containing a single-stranded, circular DNA genome of approximately 3.8kb. We completely synthesized the 3 808 nucleotides of the TTV (SANBAN isolate) genome, which contains a hairpin structure and a GC-rich region. More than 100 overlapping oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and assembled by polymerase chain assembly reaction (PCA), and the synthesis was completed with splicing by overlap extension (SOEing). This study establishes the methodological basis of the chemical synthesis of a viral genome for use as a live attenuated vaccine or gene therapy vector.","909":"In light of the scarcity of reports on the interaction between HSV-1 nucleocapsid protein UL25 and its host cell proteins, the purpose of this study is to use yeast two-hybrid screening to search for cellular proteins that can interact with the UL25 protein. C9orf69, a protein of unknown function was identified. The interaction between the two proteins under physiological conditions was also confirmed by biological experiments including co-localization by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation. A preliminary study of the function of C9orf69 showed that it promotes viral proliferation. Further studies showed that C9orf69 did not influence viral multiplication efficiency by transcriptional regulation of viral genes, but indirectly promoted proliferation via interaction with UL25.","910":"Ebola virus infection causes severe hemorrhagic fever in human and non-human primates with high mortality. Viral entry\/infection is initiated by binding of glycoprotein GP protein on Ebola virion to host cells, followed by fusion of virus-cell membrane also mediated by GP. Using an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based pseudotyping system, the roles of 41 Ebola GP1 residues in the receptor-binding domain in viral entry were studied by alanine scanning substitutions. We identified that four residues appear to be involved in protein folding\/structure and four residues are important for viral entry. An improved entry interference assay was developed and used to study the role of these residues that are important for viral entry. It was found that R64 and K95 are involved in receptor binding. In contrast, some residues such as I170 are important for viral entry, but do not play a major role in receptor binding as indicated by entry interference assay and\/or protein binding data, suggesting that these residues are involved in post-binding steps of viral entry. Furthermore, our results also suggested that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common cellular molecule for entry.","911":"Perinatal transmission of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also called mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), accounts for 90% of infections in infants worldwide and occurs in 30%-45% of children born to untreated HIV-1 infected mothers. Among HIV-1 infected mothers, some viruses are transmitted from mothers to their infants while others are not. The relationship between virologic properties and the pathogenesis caused by HIV-1 remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that one obvious source of selective pressure in the perinatal transmission of HIV-1 is maternal neutralizing antibodies. Recent studies have shown that viruses which are successfully transmitted to the child have growth advantages over those not transmitted, when those two viruses are grown together. Furthermore, the higher fitness is determined by the gp120 protein of the virus envelope. This suggests that the selective transmission of viruses with higher fitness occurred exclusively, regardless of transmission routes. There are many factors contributing to the selective transmission and HIV replicative fitness is an important one that should not be neglected. This review summarizes current knowledge of the role of HIV replicative fitness in HIV MTCT transmission and the determinants of viral fitness upon MTCT.","912":null,"913":"Naturally occurring mutations in surface proteins of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) usually result in altered hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) secretion efficiency. In the present study, we reported two conserved residues, M75 and M103 with respect to HBsAg, mutations of which not only attenuated HBsAg secretion (M75 only), but also suppressed HBV genome replication without compromising the overlapping p-gene product. We also found M75 and M103 can initiate truncated surface protein (TSPs) synthesis upon over-expression of full-length surface proteins, which may possibly contribute to HBV genome replication. However, attempts to rescue replication-defective HBV mutant by co-expression of TSPs initiated from M75 or M103 were unsuccessful, which indicated surface proteins rather than the putative TSPs were involved in regulation of HBV genome replication.","914":"Recent studies showed that white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) isolates from different geographic locations share a high genetic similarity except the variable regions in ORF23\/24 and ORF14\/15, and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) within ORF94. In this study, genotyping was performed according to these three variable regions among WSSV isolates collected during 1998\/1999 from Southern China. These WSSV isolates contain a deletion of 1168, 5657, 5898, 9316 and 11093 bp, respectively in the variable region ORF23\/24 compared with WSSV-TW, and a deletion of 4749 or 5622 bp in the variable region ORF14\/15 relative to TH-96-II. Four types of repeat units (RUs) (6, 8, 9 and 13 RUs) in ORF94 were detected in these isolates, with the shortest 6 RUs as the most prevalent type. Our results provide important information for a better understanding of the spatio-temporal transmission mode and the WSSV genetic evolution lineage.","915":"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can interact with and exploit the host cellular machinery to replicate and propagate itself. Numerous studies have shown that the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway can positively regulate the replication of HIV-1, but exactly how each MAPK pathway affects HIV-1 infection and replication is not understood. In this study, we used the Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor, PD98059, the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway inhibitor, SP600125, and the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580, to investigate the roles of these pathways in HIV-1 replication. We found that application of PD98059 results in a strong VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1(NL4-3) luciferase reporter virus and HIV-1(NL4-3) virus inhibition activity. In addition, SB203580 and SP600125 also elicited marked VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1(NL4-3) luciferase reporter virus inhibition activity but no HIV-1(NL4-3) virus inhibition activity. We also found that SB203580 and SP600125 can enhance the HIV-1 inhibition activity of PD98059 when cells were treated with all three MAPK pathway inhibitors in combination. Finally, we show that HIV-1 virus inhibition activity of the MAPK pathway inhibitors was the result of the negative regulation of HIV-1 LTR promoter activity.","916":"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for functional gene analysis which has been successfully used to downregulate the expression levels of target genes. The goal of this research was to provide a highly robust and concise methodology for in-vitro screening of efficient siRNAs from a bulk to be used as a tool to protect potato plants against PVY invasion. In our study, a 480 bp fragment of the capsid protein gene of potato virus Y (CP-PVY) was used as a target to downregulate PVY mRNA expression in-vitro, as the CP gene interferes with viral uncoating, translation and replication. A total of six siRNAs were designed and screened through transient transfection assay and knockdown in expression of CP-PVY mRNA was calculated in CHO-k cells. CP-PVY mRNA knockdown efficiency was analyzed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR of CHO-k cells co-transfected with a CP gene construct and siRNAs. Six biological replicates were performed in this study. In our findings, one CP gene specific siRNA out of a total of six was found to be the most effective for knockdown of CP-PVY mRNA in transfected CHO-k cells by up to 80%-90%.","917":null,"918":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a deadly infectious disease caused by SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Inactivated SARS-CoV has been explored as a vaccine against SARS-CoV. However, safe and potent adjuvants, especially with more efficient and economical needle-free vaccination are always needed more urgently in a pandemic. The development of a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant and vaccine for prevention of emergent infectious diseases such as SARS will be an important advancement. PIKA, a stabilized derivative of Poly (I:C), was previously reported to be safe and potent as adjuvant in mouse models. In the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with this improved Poly (I:C) derivative induced strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus. Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites, co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity. When intranasal immunization was used, PIKA was obligatorily for inducing neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites and was correlated with both mucosal IgA and mucosal IgG response. Overall, PIKA could be a good mucosal adjuvant candidate for inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine for use in possible future pandemic.","919":"Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), belonging to the Filoviridae family, emerged four decades ago and caused severe viral hemorrhagic fever in human and other primates. As high as 50-90% mortality, filoviruses can cause significant threats to public health. However, so far no specific and efficient vaccine has been available, nor have other treatment methods proved to be effective. It is of great importance to detect these pathogens specific, rapidly and sensitively in order to control future filovirus outbreaks. Here, recent progresses in the development of detection and diagnosis methods for EBOV and MARV are summarized.","920":"","921":"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) are three shrimp viruses responsible for major pandemics affecting the shrimp farming industry. Shrimps samples were collected from 12 farms in Zhejiang province, China, in 2008 and analyzed by PCR to determine the prevalence of these viruses. From the 12 sampling locations, 8 farms were positive for WSSV, 8 for IHHNV and 6 for both WSSV and IHHNV. An average percentage of 57.4% of shrimp individuals were infected with WSSV, while 49.2% were infected with IHHNV. A high prevalence of co-infection with WSSV and IHHNV among samples was detected from the following samples: Bingjiang (93.3%), liuao (66.7%), Jianshan (46.7%) and Xianxiang (46.7%). No samples exhibited evidence of infection with TSV in collected samples. This study provides comprehensive information of the prevalence of three shrimp viruses in Zhejiang and may be helpful for disease prevention control in this region.","922":null,"923":"Although previous publications suggest the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was reassorted from swine viruses of North America and Eurasia, the immediate ancestry still remains elusive due to the big evolutionary distance between the 2009 H1N1 virus and the previously isolated strains. Since the unveiling of the 2009 H1N1 influenza, great deal of interest has been drawn to influenza, consequently a large number of influenza virus sequences have been deposited into the public sequence databases. Blast analysis demonstrated that the recently submitted 2007 South Dakota avian influenza virus strains and other North American avian strains contained genetic segments very closely related to the 2009 H1N1 virus, which suggests these avian influenza viruses are very close relatives of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Phylogenetic analyses also indicate that the 2009 H1N1 viruses are associated with both avian and swine influenza viruses circulating in North America. Since the migrating wild birds are preferable to pigs as the carrier to spread the influenza viruses across vast distances, it is very likely that birds played an important role in the inter-continental evolution of the 2009 H1N1 virus. It is essential to understand the evolutionary route of the emerging influenza virus in order to find a way to prevent further emerging cases. This study suggests the close relationship between 2009 pandemic virus and the North America avian viruses and underscores enhanced surveillance of influenza in birds for understanding the evolution of the 2009 pandemic influenza.","924":"Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) is a novel Fijivirus prevalent in rice in southern and central China, and northern Vietnam. Its genome has 10 segments of double-stranded RNA named S1 to S10 according to their size. An isolate of SRBSDV, JNi4, was obtained from naturally infected maize plants from Ji'ning, Shandong province, in the 2008 maize season. Segments S7 to S10 of JNi4 share nucleotide identities of 72.6%-73.1%, 72.3%-73%, 73.9%-74.5% and 77.3%-79%, respectively, with corresponding segments of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus isolates, and identities of 99.7%, 99.1%-99.7%, 98.9%-99.5%, and 98.6%-99.2% with those of SRBSDV isolates HN and GD. JNi4 forms a separate branch with GD and HN in the phylogenetic trees constructed with genomic sequences of S7 to S10. These results confirm the proposed taxonomic status of SRBSDV as a distinct species of the genus Fijivirus and indicate that JNi4 is an isolate of SRBSDV. Shandong is so far the northernmost region where SRBSDV is found in China.","925":"RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which introduced small interfering RNA (siRNA) can cause the specific degradation of mRNA with identical sequences. The human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) RR is composed of two distinct homodimeric subunits encoded by UL39 and UL40, respectively. In this study, we applied siRNAs targeting the UL39 and UL40 genes of HSV-1. We showed that synthetic siRNA silenced effectively and specifically UL39 and UL40 mRNA expression and inhibited HSV-1 replication. Our work offers new possibilities for RNAi as a genetic tool for inhibition of HSV-1 replication.","926":"A sandwich format immunochromatographic assay for detecting foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotypes was developed. In this rapid test, affinity purified polyclonal antibodies from Guinea pigs which were immunized with sucking-mouse adapted FMD virus (A\/AV88(L) strain) were conjugated to colloidal gold beads and used as the capture antibody, and affinity purified polyclonal antibodies from rabbits which were immunized with cell-culture adapted FMD virus (A\/CHA\/09 strain) were used as detector antibody. On the nitrocellulose membrane of the immunochromatographic strip, the capture antibody was laid on a sample pad, the detector antibody was printed at the test line(T) and goat anti-guinea pigs IgG antibodies were immobilized to the control line(C). The lower detection limit of the test for a FMDV 146S antigen is 11.7 ng\/ml as determined in serial tests after the strip device was assembled and the assay condition optimization. No cross reactions were found with FMDV serotype C, Swine vesicular disease (SVD), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VES) viral antigens with this rapid test. Clinically, the diagnostic sensitivity of this test for FMDV serotypes A was 88.7% which is as same as an indirect-sandwich ELISA. The specificity of this strip test was 98.2% and is comparable to the 98.7% obtained with indirect-sandwich ELISA. This rapid strip test is simple, easy and fast for clinical testing on field sites; no special instruments and skills are required, and the result can be obtained within 15 min. To our knowledge, this is the first rapid immunochromatogarpic assay for serotype A of FMDV.","927":null,"928":"In the present study, a total of 24 MAbs were produced against bluetongue virus (BTV) by polyethyleneglycol (PEG) mediated fusion method using sensitized lymphocytes and myeloma cells.

Out of 24 clones, a majority of them (n = 18) belong to various IgG subclasses and the remaining (n = 6) to the IgM class. A panel of eight clones reactive to both whole BTV and purified rVP7 protein were identified based on their reactivity in iELISA. For competitive ELISA, the clone designated as 4A10 showed better inhibition to hyperimmune serum of BTV serotype 23. However, this clone showed a variable percent of inhibition ranging from16.6% with BTV 12 serotype to 78.9% with BTV16 serotype using 24 serotype specific sera of BTV originating from guinea pig at their lowest dilutions. From the available panel of clones, only 4A10 was found to have a possible diagnostic application.","929":"In recent years, the in silico epitopes prediction tools have facilitated the progress of vaccines development significantly and many have been applied to predict epitopes in viruses successfully. Herein, a general overview of different tools currently available, including T cell and B cell epitopes prediction tools, is presented. And the principles of different prediction algorithms are reviewed briefly. Finally, several examples are present to illustrate the application of the prediction tools.","930":"In order to evaluate the anti-influenza virus activity of the effective monomer from Folium Isatidis (FI) in vivo, we established mice model with viral pneumonia and divided them into 3 different dose groups, then observed their lung indexes, pulmonary pathological changes, pulmonary virus hemagglitination titers, living time and death rates. The results showed that the monomer could reduce the pulmonary index from 2.64 to 1.93, 1.63 and 1.40 (P&lt;0.01) and decrease the hemagglitination titer from 1.15 to 0.84, 0.70 and 0.59 (P&lt;0.01). In addition, different groups of FI could significantly lessen the mortality rate from 100% to 30%, 25% and 15%, and prolong the living time from 5.1d to 6.5d, 8.4d and 8.9 d respectively(P&lt;0.01). The high dose (75 mg\/kg\/d) has the similar effect with 100 mg\/kg\/d dose of virazole(P&gt;0.05), and more effective than 200 mg\/kg\/d dose of antiviral liquor (P&lt;0.05).","931":"Prion diseases are infectious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases. The pathogenic agent is an abnormal prion protein aggregate. Microglial activation in the centre nervous system is a characteristic feature of prion disease. In this study, we examined the effect of PrP 106-126 on PrP mRNA gene expression in Mouse microglia cells BV-2 by real-time quantitative PCR. PrP mRNA expression level was found to be significantly increased after 18 h exposure of BV-2 cells to PrP 106-126, with 3-fold increase after 18 h and 4.5-fold increase after 24 h and BV-2 cells proliferating occurred correspondingly. Our results provide the first in vitro evidence of the increase of PrP mRNA levels in microglial cells exposed to PrP 106-126, and indicate that microglial cells might play a critical role in prion pathogenesis.","932":null,"933":null,"934":"The protein HTRP (human transcription regulator protein) is encoded by the differential gene htrp and induced by Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in KMB-17 cells. HTRP was found to interact with SAP30 (mSin3A Association Protein), one of the components of co-repressor complex mSin3A, which is part of the deacetylation transfer enzyme HDAC. To reveal the biological significance of the interaction between HTRP and SAP30, real- time PCR and a dual-luciferase detecting system was used. The results indicate that HTRP could inhibit the transcription of a viral promoter, whose interaction with SAP30 synergistically affects transcriptional inhibition of the viral genes, and is related to HDAC enzyme activity. ChIP experiments demonstrate that HTRP could promote HDAC activity by increasing the deacetylation level of lysine 14 and lysine 9 in histone H3.","935":"In Egypt, protection of cattle against lumpy skin disease (LSD) was carried out using a sheep poxvirus (Kenyan strain) vaccination strategy. In the present study 15 skin nodules from LSD suspected cows and 5 scab samples from sheep pox (SP) suspected sheep were collected. Hyperimmune rabbit sera to Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV)\/Ismailyia88 strain and sheep pox virus (SPV)\/ Kenyan vaccinal strain were prepared. The causative agent in the collected samples was identified using immunoflourescence (IF) and immunoperoxidase techniques. Of the 15 skin nodules suspected of LSD, 10 showed a positive reaction and 3 out of 5 skin scabs suspected of sheeppox were found to be positive. An antigenic correlation between field skin isolate of LSDV, tissue culture adapted LSDV\/Ismailyia88 strain, field skin isolate of SPV and SPV\/Kenyan vaccinal strain was studied using prepared hyperimmune sera. Also, nucleotide sequence of the PCR amplified attachment gene fragments of field skin isolate of LSDV, tissue culture adapted LSDV\/Ismailyia88 strain, field skin isolate of SPV and SPV \/Kenyan vaccinal strain were compared. The results revealed that the four used viruses were antigenically identical. Sequence analysis indicated that field skin LSDV isolate is more related to tissue culture adapted LSDV\/Ismailyia88 strain than to vaccinal SPV\/ Kenyan strain and the skin isolate of SPV is more closely related to field skin isolate of LSDV than to SPV\/Kenyan vaccinal strain. Thus, further study should be applied on the advantage of a LSD vaccine prepared from LSDV in protection of cattle against LSD compared to the commonly used sheep pox vaccine.","936":null,"937":"A monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for the bluetongue virus (BTV) group specific antigen (VP7) was characterized for its reactivity with purified virus and recombinant BTV VP7 (rVP7) protein and its suitability for use in the sandwich ELISA. The MAb, designated as 5B5 was specific to VP7 and belongs to IgG2a subclass and was selected for the development of the sELISA in this study. The MAb had a titer of 1:25 with BTV and 1:2 with the rVP7 protein. The sELISA is based on capturing of BTV antigen with VP7 specific MAb followed by detection using BTV polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits. The assay was evaluated with six cell culture adapted serotypes of BTV that have been isolated from India, 1, 2, 15, 17, 18 and 23. The assay could detect BTV antigen as early as day 8 in blood. It was also successfully applied for the detection of BTV group specific antigen in clinical samples of blood, washed RBCs, buffy coat and plasma. A total of 102 field samples from animals, suspected of being infected with BTV, were tested and 29.42% were positive. The blood samples were also amplified in cell culture which improved the sensitivity of the assay. Results confirmed that the sELISA is rapid and specific.","938":"The complete nucleotide sequence of the measles virus strain IMB-1, which was isolated in China, was determined. As in other measles viruses, its genome is 15,894 nucleotides in length and encodes six proteins. The full-length nucleotide sequence of the IMB-1 isolate differed from vaccine strains (including wild-type Edmonston strain) by 4%-5% at the nucleotide sequence level. This isolate has amino acid variations over the full genome, including in the hemagglutinin and fusion genes. This report is the first to describe the full-length genome of a genotype H1 strain and provide an overview of the diversity of genetic characteristics of a circulating measles virus.","939":"NAS preparation, a kind of Chinese herbal medicine found by the Yunnan Eco-agricultural Research Institute, has potential antiviral activity. In this paper, the inhibiting effect of NAS preparation on H9N2 subtype Avian influenza virus (AIV) was investigated in vivo. Chickens infected with H9N2 virus were treated with NAS preparation for 4 days. The virus was then detected by hemoagglutination (HA) test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that no H9N2 virus could be detected at the 7th day when the chickens were treated with 0.2 g\/kg\/d or 0.1 g\/kg\/d of NAS preparation. However the virus could be detected in other chickens without NAS preparation treatment. This result suggested that NAS preparation may be a potential drug candidate to control infection of H9N2 subtype AIV in chickens.","940":"In order to quantitate the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) infection in vitro, a BIV indicator cell line (BIVL) was established by transfecting baby hamster kidney cells with reporter plasmids containing the firefly luciferase gene driven by a BIV long terminal repeat promoter. The BIV activates promoter activity of the LTR to express luciferase upon infection. BIV infection could therefore by quantified by detection of luciferase activity. Compared to standard assays used to detect BIV infection, the BIVL-based assay is 10 times more sensitive than the the CPE-based assay, and has similar sensitivity with the viral capsid protein Western blot assay. BIV indicator cell line could detect BIV infection specifically. Luciferase activity of BIV infected BIVL cells showed a time dependent manner, and 60 h post infection is the optimal time to detect BIV infection. Luciferase activity of BIVL cells correlates with the BIV capsid protein expression. Moreover, a linear relationship was found between MOI and the activated intensity of luciferase expression. In brief, the BIV indicator cell line is an easy, robust and quantitive method for monitoring BIV infection.","941":"An exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV) strain SDAU09C1 was isolated in DF-1 cells from one of 240 imported 1-day-old white meat-type grand parent breeder chicks. Inoculation of SDAU09C1 in ALV-free chickens induced antibody reactions specific to subgroup A or B. But gp85 amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that SDAU09C1 fell into subgroup A; it had homology of 88.8%-90.3% to 6 reference strains of subgroup A, much higher compared to other subgroups including subgroup B. This is the first report for ALV of subgroup A isolated from imported breeders.","942":null,"943":"Viruses (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus, Human simplex virus and Prototype foamy virus) are obligate intracellular parasites and therefore depend on the cellular machinery for cellular trafficking. Bovine foamy virus (BFV) is a member of the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily of Retroviruses, however, details of its cellular trafficking remain unknown. In this study, we cloned the BFV gag gene into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a and purified the denaturalized Gag protein. The protein was used to immunize BALB\/c mouse to produce antiserum, which could specifically recognize the BFV Gag protein in BFV-infected cells through western blot assay. Additionally, these results demonstrated that both the optimal and suboptimal cleavage of Gag protein occur in BFV-infected cells. Subsequently, the Gag antiserum was used to investigate subcellular localization of BFV. In immunofluorescence microscopy assays, colocalization microtubules (MTs) and assembling viral particles were clearly observed, which implied that BFV may transport along cellular MTs in host cells. Furthermore, MTs-depolymerizing assay indicated MTs were required for the efficient replication of BFV. In conclusion, our study suggests that BFV has evolved the mechanism to hijack the cellular cytoskeleton for its replication.","944":null,"945":"The comparative analysis of the biological characterization and the genetic background study of EV71 circulating strains is commonly recognized as basic work necessary for development of an effective EV71 vaccine. In this study, we sequenced five EV71 circulating strains, isolated from Fuyang, Hefei, Kunming and Shenzhen city of China and named them FY-23, FY-22, H44, K9 and S1 respectively. The sequence alignment demonstrated their genotypes be C4. The genetic distance of the VP1 gene from these isolates suggested that they were highly co-related with genetic identity similar to other previously reported EV71 strains in China. Additionally, these strains were identified to display some obvious proliferation dynamics and plaque morphology when propagated in Vero cells. However, a distinctive difference in pathogenic ability in neonatal mice was found. Some differences in cross neutralization test &amp; immunogenic analysis were also found. All these results are related to the biological characterization of circulating EV71 strains in China and aid in the development of an EV71 vaccine in the future.","946":"Three pairs of specific primers were designed to amplify the F2-1, F2-2 and XF2-2 truncated sequences of ORF2 which encodes the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). The F2-1 sequence had most of the NLS region of ORF2, but the F2-2 and XF2-2 genes had the NLS region deleted. Truncated genes were subcloned into pET-32a(+) vectors to construct recombinant fusion expression vectors. The vectors were then transformed into Rosetta(DE3) E. coli and expressed by induction of IPTG. Expressed proteins were detected by western blotting and ELISA. The protein with best immunoreactivity was confirmed and selected, then utilized to inoculate SPF rabbits to prepare polyclonal antibodies. The protein and prepared polyclonal antibody were utilized to detect sera samples against PCV-2 from Shandong province and PCV-2 particles in PK-15 cells. In our study, three recombinant fusion proteins were successfully obtained, and the molecular weights of fusion proteins were 35.9 kDa, 33.6 kDa and 38.6 kDa respectively detected by SDS-PAGE. All of the proteins showed positive reaction with anti-PCV-2 antisera, and His-XF2-2 showed better immunoreactivity than the others. The protein of His-XF2-2 was coated as antigen in ELISA to detect the seroprevalence of PCV-2 in certain districts of Shandong province, the seropositivity rate was 27.7 % (73\/264). Specific fluorescence and positive signals for PCV-2 could be detected in PK-15 cells inoculated with PCV-2 with the participation of prepared antibodies against His-XF2-2 in IFA and IPMA. Experimental results indicated that the truncated PCV-2 ORF2 gene containing most of the NLS region was successfully expressed in E. coli, and His-XF2-2 was demonstrated to have better immunoreactivity with anti-PCV-2 antisera than the other two fusion proteins. His-XF2-2 and prepared polyclonal antibodies against it had a satisfactory capability in detecting PCV-2 infection.","947":null,"948":"Since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the lifespan and quality of life of patients infected with HIV have been significantly improved. But treatment efficacy was compromised eventually by the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs, and more new anti-HIV drugs with lower toxicity and higher activity were needed. Based on the experience and lessons learned from the treatment in the developed countries, US FDA suggested that more pharmacodynamical researches should be considered ahead of the clinical trials. To facilitate the anti-HIV drug research and development, we reviewed a few specialized issues that should be focused on drug evaluations in vitro, including: 1) Mechanism of action studies, demonstrating the candidate drug's efficacy to specifically inhibit viral replication or a virus-specific function and confirm the drug target. 2) Drug resistance studies, selecting the drug-resistant variants in vitro and determining the activities inhibiting HIV isolates resistant to approved antiretroviral drugs of the same class. 3) Antiviral activity in vitro in the presence of serum proteins, ascertaining whether an investigational product is significantly bound by serum proteins. 4) Combination activity analysis, evaluating in vitro antiviral activity of an investigational product in two-drug combinations with other drugs approved.","949":"Chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) presents one of the serious public health challenges worldwide. Current treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is limited, and is composed of interferon and nucleoside\/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Interferon is poorly tolerated and is only responsive in a small fraction of CHB patients and NRTIs often face the problem of emergence of drug resistance during long-term treatment. The current treatment of CHB can be improved in several ways including genotyping mutations associated with drug resistance before treatment to guide the choice of NRTIs and suitable combinations among NRTIs and interferon. It is important to continue research in the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the life cycle of HBV or in the host immune system to stimulate the development of new antiviral agents and immunotherapies. Several antiviral agents targeting HBV entry, cccDNA, capsid formation, viral morphogenesis and virion secretion, as well as two therapeutic vaccines are currently being evaluated in preclinical studies or in clinical trials to assess their anti-HBV efficacy.","950":"Viral infection begins with the entry of the virus into the host target cell and initiates replication. For this reason, the virus entry machinery is an excellent target for antiviral therapeutics. In general, a virus life cycle includes several major steps: cell-surface attachment, entry, replication, assembly, and egress, while some viruses involve another stage called latency. The early steps of the virus life cycle include virus attachment, receptor binding, and entry. These steps involve the initial interactions between a virus and the host cell and thus are major determinants of the tropism of the virus infection, the nature of the virus replication, and the diseases resulting from the infection. Owing to the pathological importance of these early steps in the progress of viral infectious diseases, the development of inhibitors against these steps has been the focus of the pharmaceutical industry. In this review, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and Human Enterovirus 71 (EV71) were used as representatives of enveloped DNA, enveloped RNA, and non-enveloped viruses, respectively. The current mechanistic understanding of their attachment and entry, and the strategies for antagonist screenings are summarized herein.","951":"Ion channels are membrane proteins that are found in a number of viruses and which are of crucial physiological importance in the viral life cycle. They have one common feature in that their action mode involves a change of electrochemical or proton gradient across the bilayer lipid membrane which modulates viral or cellular activity. We will discuss a group of viral channel proteins that belong to the viroproin family, and which participate in a number of viral functions including promoting the release of viral particles from cells. Blocking these channel-forming proteins may be \"lethal\", which can be a suitable and potential therapeutic strategy. In this review we discuss seven ion channels of viruses which can lead serious infections in human beings: M2 of influenza A, NB and BM2 of influenza B, CM2 of influenza C, Vpu of HIV-1, p7 of HCV and 2B of picornaviruses.","952":"Over 170 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of liver diseases. Current interferon-based therapy is of limited efficacy and has significant side effects and more effective and better tolerated therapies are urgently needed. HCV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus with a 9.6 kb genome that encodes ten viral proteins. Among them, the NS3 protease and the NS5B polymerase are essential for viral replication and have been the main focus of drug discovery efforts. Aided by structure-based drug design, potent and specific inhibitors of NS3 and NS5B have been identified, some of which are in late stage clinical trials and may significantly improve current HCV treatment. Inhibitors of other viral targets such as NS5A are also being pursued. However, HCV is an RNA virus characterized by high replication and mutation rates and consequently, resistance emerges quickly in patients treated with specific antivirals as monotherapy. A complementary approach is to target host factors such as cyclophilins that are also essential for viral replication and may present a higher genetic barrier to resistance. Combinations of these inhibitors of different mechanism are likely to become the essential components of future HCV therapies in order to maximize antiviral efficacy and prevent the emergence of resistance.","953":"An estimated 130 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) making it a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. Because the currently available therapy of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin is only effective in a subset of patients, the development of new HCV antivirals is a healthcare imperative. This review discusses the experimental models available for HCV antiviral drug research, recent advances in HCV antiviral drug development, as well as active research being pursued to facilitate development of new HCV-specific therapeutics.","954":"","955":"The complete genome sequence of transmissible Gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strain TS, previously isolated from Gansu province, was cloned and compared with published sequence data from other TGEV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis based on the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the S gene showed that the TGEV strains were divided into 3 clusters. TGEV TS showed a close evolutionary relationship to the American Miller cluster but had a 5' non-translated region (NTR) sequence closely related to the American Purdue cluster. Continued culture in different cell types indicated that TGEV TS virulence could be attenuated after fifty passages in Porcine kidney (PK-15) cells, and that the Porcine kidney cell line IB-RS-2 (IBRS) was not suitable for culture of the TGEV strain TS.","956":"VP1, a capsid protein of swine vesicular disease virus, was cloned from the SVDV HK\/70 strain and inserted into retroviral vector pBABE puro, and expressed in PK15 cells by an retroviral expression system. The ability of the VP1 protein to induce an immune response was then evaluated in guinea pigs. Western blot and ELISA results indicated that the VP1 protein can be recognized by SVDV positive serum, Furthermore, anti-SVDV specific antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation were elicited and increased by VP1 protein after vaccination. These results encourage further work towards the development of a vaccine against SVDV infection.","957":"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the causative agent of cold sores and other more serious diseases. HSV-1 infected-cell protein 27 (ICP27) is an immediate-early regulatory phosphoprotein homologous to gene products identified in all classes of herpesviruses so far. To raise the antiserum to ICP27 for further characterization of its biological function, the ICP27 gene was cloned into the pET-28a (+) vector, then ICP27 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni(2+)-NTA) affinity resin column, finally the purified protein was used to raise antiserum. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the antiserum recognized the recombinant protein, and the antiserum was able to probe the ICP27 in HSV-1 infected cells with high specificity by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Therefore, the specific antiserum will provide a valuable tool for further studies investigating ICP27's biological function during HSV-1 infection.","958":"Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is an important swine disease that is closely associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). The capsid protein (Cap protein) is a major structural protein that has at least three immunoreactive regions, and it can be a suitable candidate antigen for detecting the specific antibodies of a PCV2 infection. In the present study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TcELISA) based on a truncated soluble Cap protein produced in Escherichia coli (E.coli) was established and validated for the diagnostic PCV2 antibodies in swine. The TcELISA was validated by comparison with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). The diagnostic sensitivity (DSN), specificity (DSP), and accuracy of the TcELISA were 88.6%, 90.7% and 89.4%, respectively. The agreement rate was 89.38% between results obtained with TcELISA and IIFA on 113 field sera. A cross-reactivity assay showed that the method was PCV2-specific by comparison with other sera of viral disease. Therefore,the TcELISA will be helpful for the development of a reliable serology diagnostic test for large scale detection of PCV2 antibodies and for the evaluation of vaccine against PCV2 in swine.","959":"In this paper, the function of the ie1 gene from baculovirus Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV), belonging to group II nucleopolyhedrovirus, was studied in mammalian cells. We amplified the SeMNPV ie1 gene and expressed it by fusing to the C terminal of enhanced GFP protein in HEK 293 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that the IE1-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of the mammalian cells. The promoter sequences of AcMNPV gp64, SeMNPV F protein and Drosophila hsp70 were also analyzed, to further study the function of SeMNPV IE1. The results showed that, in the absence of the hr sequence, IE1 improved the expression of the F promoter but didn't influence the gp64 promoter significantly, but IE1 moderately stimulated the hsp70 promoter.","960":"To study the kinetics in vivo of a Hantaan virus DNA vaccine, we constructed a fusion DNA vaccine, pEGFP\/S, by cloning the S segment of Hantavirus into the vector, pEGFP-C1, which encodes Green fluorescent protein EGFP. In this report, we provide evidence that pEGFP\/S was distributed and persistently expressed for more than 60 days in several organs after inoculation. Our findings suggest that the persistent immune responses induced by a Hantaan virus DNA vaccine are likely due to the plasmid pEGFP\/S deposited in vivo, which acts as a booster immunization.","961":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally related to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a proportion of cases of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). The ORF73 protein was cloned into pQE80L-orf73 and expressed in E.coli and purified. The expressed recombinant ORF73 was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A protein of about 27 kDa was expressed as expected. Western Blotting showed that the purified recombinant ORF73 reacted with KSHV positive serum. The immunogenicity of the recombinant ORF73 was further analysed by ELISA and the optimal conditions were determined. The ORF73 ELISA was used to compare the KSHV seroprevalence between Hubei and Xinjiang Han people. The Han people in Xinjiang have significantly higher KSHV seroprevalence than their counterparts in Hubei (6.7% vs 2.9%, P = 0.005).","962":"Nuclear proteins often form punctiform structures, but the precise mechanism for this process is unknown. As a preliminary study, we investigated the aggregation of an HSV-1 immediate-early protein, infected-cell protein 22 (ICP22), in the nucleus by observing the localization of ICP22-EGFP fusion protein. Results showed that, in high-level expression conditions, ICP22-EGFP gradually concentrates in the nucleus, persists throughout the cell cycle without disaggregation even in the cell division phase, and is finally distributed to daughter cells. We subsequently constructed a mammalian cell expression system, which had tetracycline-dependent transcriptional regulators. Consequently, the location of ICP22-EGFP in the nucleus changed with distinct induction conditions. This suggests that the cellular location of ICP22 is also influenced by promoter regulation, in addition to its own structure. Our findings provide new clues for the investigation of transcriptional regulation of viral genes. In addition, the non-protease reporter system we constructed could be utilized to evaluate the role of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) on transcriptional regulation.","963":"The nucleolus is a subnuclear structure of eukaryocytes. It was thought that nucleolus only participates in the biogenesis and processing of rRNA. However, more and more evidence shows that it has many other functions, such as tRNA precursor processing, stress sensing and it is also involved in gene silencing, senescence and cell cycle regulation. Here, we summarize the recent understandings about the nucleolar functions, the regulation of nucleolar localization of proteins and the role that the nucleolus plays in virus infection, in which some related studies of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) US11, UL24 and bovine herpesvirus-1 infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) carried out in our lab will also be included.","964":null,"965":null,"966":null,"967":"Previous study on TNFR1-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis has been implicated in the development of fulminant viral hepatitis.

Identification of the epitope regions of the virus is important for the diagnosis and epidemiological studies of CCHFV infections. In this study, expression vectors carrying series truncated fragments of the NP (nucleocapsid protein) gene from the S fragment of CCHFV strain YL04057 were constructed. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E.coli and purified for detection. The antigenic of the truncated fragments of NP was detected with a polyclonal serum (rabbit) and 2 monoclonal (mAbs) (14B7 and 43E5) against CCHFV by Western-blot analyses. The results showed that the three expressed constructs, which all contained the region 235AA to 305AA could be detected by mAbs polyclonal serum.

VP1 and the fused epitopes GST-E1, GST-E2 (+2) and GST-E1-2 were successfully solubly expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and Western blot analysis demonstrated they retained antigenicity. Indirect VP1-ELISA and epitope ELISAs were subsequently developed to screen a panel of 80 field pig sera using LPB-ELISA as a standard test. For VP1-ELISA and all the epitope ELISAs, there were clear distinctions between the FMDV-positive and the FMDV-negative samples. Cross-reactions with pig sera positive to the viruses of swine vesicular disease virus that produce clinically indistinguishable syndromes in pigs or guinea pig antisera to FMDV strains of type A, C and Asia1 did not occur. The relative sensitivity and specificity for the GST-E1 ELISA, GST-E2 (+2), GST-E1-2 ELISA and VP1-ELISA in comparison with LPB-ELISA were 93.3% and 85.0%, 95.0% and 90%, 100% and 81.8%, 96.6% and 80.9% respectively.

The co-localization of SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 in the cytoplasm of HEK293FT cells was also shown using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It is suggested that their interaction might be through direct combination. Under a fluorescence microscope, it was observed that the purified fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was attached to the cell membrane of CXCL16-transfected cells, indicating that SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 can be mutually combined.","976":"In order to establish the eukaryotic cell lines for inducible control of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene expression. The recombinant plasmid of pTRE-Tight-SARS-N was constructed by using the plasmid p8S as the PCR template which contains a cDNA clone covering the nucleocapsid gene of SARS-CoV HKU-39449. Restriction enzymes digestion and sequence analysis indicated the recombinant plasmid of pTRE-Tight-SARS-N contained the nucleocapsid gene with the optimized nucleotide sequence which will improve the translation efficiency. Positive cell clones were selected by cotransfecting pTRE-Tight-SARS-N with the linear marker pPUR to BHK-21 Tet-on cells in the presence of puromycin. A set of double-stable eukaryotic cell lines (BHK-Tet-SARS-N) with inducible control of the SARS-CoV neucleocapsid gene expression was identified by using SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The expression of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was tightly regulated by the varying concentration of doxcycline in the constructed double-stable cell line. The constructed BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell strains will facilitate the rescue of SARS-CoV in vitro and the further reverse genetic research of SARS-CoV.","977":"A polyclonal antibody-based antigen-capture ELISA (AC-ELISA) has been developed for detection of Canine parvovirus (CPV) antigens in faecal samples of dogs. The assay uses rabbit anti-CPV polyclonal antibody as the capture antibody, guinea pig anti-CPV polyclonal antibody as tracing antibody and anti-guinea pig HRPO conjugate as the detection system. The optimum dilution of the capture antibody and the tracing antibody capable of detecting the CPV-2 antigens was found to be 1:1 600 and 1:400, respectively, in the check-board titration. In this study, a total of 152 samples (129 faecal samples and 23 cell culture supernatant) were tested both by AC-ELISA and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the samples tested, 69 and 78 samples were found positive by AC-ELISA and PCR, respectively. The AC-ELISA had relative sensitivity, relative specificity and accuracy of 88.4%, 100.0% and 91.4% respectively. The analytical sensitivity of AC-ELISA was estimated to be 10(2.8) TCID(50)\/mL whereas PCR sensitivity was 10(0.8) TCID(50)\/mL. The AC-ELISA is a simple, quick and reliable method for screening large numbers of faecal samples of dogs suspected of CPV infection.","978":"In this paper, in vitro anti-influenza virus activities of sulfated polysaccharide fractions from Gracilaria lemaneiformis were investigated. Cytotoxicities and antiviral activities of Gracilaria lemaneiformis polysaccharides (PGL), Gracilaria lemaneiformis polysaccharide fraction-1 (GL-1), Gracilaria lemaneiformis polysaccharide fraction-2 (GL-2) and Gracilaria lemaneiformis polysaccharide fraction-3 (GL-3) were studied by the Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method, and the inhibitory effect against Human influenza virus H1-364 induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MDCK cells were observed by the CPE method. In addition, the antiviral mechanism of PGL was explored by Plaque forming unit (PFU), MTT and CPE methods. The results showed: i) Cytotoxicities were not significantly revealed, and H1-364 induced CPE was also reduced treated with sulfated polysaccharide fractions from Gracilaria lemaneiformis; ii) Antiviral activities were associated with the mass percentage content of sulfate groups in polysaccharide fractions, which was about 13%, in polysaccharides (PGL and GL-2) both of which exhibited higher antiviral activity; iii) A potential antiviral mechanism to explain these observations is that viral adsorption and replication on host cells were inhibited by sulfated polysaccharides from Gracilaria lemaneiformis. In conclusion, Anti-influenza virus activities of sulfated polysaccharide fractions from Gracilaria lemaneiformis were revealed, and the antiviral activities were associated with content of sulfate groups in polysaccharide fractions.","979":"A novel subtype of influenza A virus 09H1N1 has rapidly spread across the world. Evolutionary analyses of this virus have revealed that 09H1N1 is a triple reassortant of segments from swine, avian and human influenza viruses. In this study, we investigated factors shaping the codon usage bias of 09H1N1 and carried out cluster analysis of 60 strains of influenza A virus from different subtypes based on their codon usage bias. We discovered that more preferentially used codons of 09H1N1 are A-ended or U-ended, and the intra-genomic codon usage bias of 09H1N1 is quite low. Base composition constraint, dinucleotide biases and translational selection are the main factors influencing the codon usage bias of 09H1N1. At the genome level, we find that the codon usage bias of 09H1N1 is similar to H1N1 (A\/swine\/Kansas\/77778\/2007H1N1), H9N2 from Asia, H1N2 from Asia and North America and H3N2 from North America. Our results provide insight for understanding the processes governing evolution, regulation of gene expression, and revealing the evolution of 09H1N1.","980":"Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 exists in vivo as quasispecies, and one of the genome's characteristics is its diversity. During the antiretroviral therapy, drug resistance is the main obstacle to effective viral prevention. Understanding the molecular evolution process is fundamental to analyze the mechanism of drug resistance and develop a strategy to minimize resistance. The molecular evolution of drug resistance of one patient who had received reverse transcriptase inhibitors for a long time and had treatment which replaced Nevirapine with Indinavir was analyzed, with the aim of observing the drug resistance evolution pathway. The patient, XLF, was followed-up for six successive times. The viral populations were amplified and sequenced by single-genome amplification. All the sequences were submitted to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database for the analysis of genotypic drug resistance. 149 entire protease and 171 entire reverse transcriptase sequences were obtained from these samples, and all sequences were identified as subtype B. Before the patient received Indinavir, the viral population only had some polymorphisms in the protease sequences. After the patient began Indinavir treatment, the variants carrying polymorphisms declined while variants carrying the secondary mutation G73S gained the advantage. As therapy was prolonged, G73S was combined with M46I\/L90M to form a resistance pattern M46I\/G73S\/L90M, which then became the dominant population. 97.9% of variants had the M46I\/G73S\/L90M pattern at XLF6. During the emergence of protease inhibitors resistance, reverse transcriptase inhibitors resistance maintained high levels. Indinavir-resistance evolution was observed by single-genome amplification. During the course of changing the regimen to incorporate Indinavir, the G73S mutation occurred and was combined with M46I\/L90M. ","981":"Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is characterized by a progressive depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes, which leads to dysfunction of the immune system. Although a variety of mechanisms may contribute to the gradual T cell decline that occurs in HIV-infected patients, abnormal apoptosis of infected or bystander T lymphocytes is an important event leading to immunodeficiency. The HIV envelope glycoprotein plays a crucial role in HIV associated apoptosis through both death receptor-mediated and mitochondria-dependent pathways. This review summarizes current knowledge of Env-mediated T lymphocyte apoptosis.","982":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in eukaryotes, plants and some viruses. It is increasingly clear that miRNAs-encoded by viruses can affect the viral life cycle and host physiology. Viral miRNAs could repress the innate and adaptive host immunity, modulate cellular signaling pathways, and regulate the expression of cellular and viral genes. These functions facilitate viral acute and persistent infections, and have profound effects on the host cell survival and disease progression. Here, we discuss the miRNAs encoded by herpesviruses, and their regulatory roles involved in virus-host interactions.","983":"Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is one of many pathogens that use the cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate as a receptor. Heparan sulfate is highly expressed on the surface and extracellular matrix of virtually all cell types making it an ideal receptor. Heparan sulfate interacts with HSV-1 envelope glycoproteins gB and gC during the initial attachment step during HSV-1 entry. In addition, a modified form of heparan sulfate, known as 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate, interacts with HSV-1 gD to induce fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membrane. The 3-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate is a rare modification which occurs during the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate that is carried out by a family of enzymes known as 3-O-sulfotransferases. Due to its involvement in multiple steps of the infection process, heparan sulfate has been a prime target for the development of agents to inhibit HSV entry. Understanding how heparan sulfate functions during HSV-1 infection may not only be critical for inhibiting infection by this virus, but it may also be crucial in the fight against many other pathogens as well.","984":"Tumor angiogenesis is the uncontrolled growth of blood vessels in tumors, serving to supply nutrients and oxygen, and remove metabolic wastes. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a multifocal angioproliferative disorder characterized by spindle cell proliferation, neo-angiogenesis, inflammation, and edema, is associated with infection by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Recent studies indicate that KSHV infection directly promotes angiogenesis and inflammation through an autocrine and paracrine mechanism by inducing pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many of these cytokines are also expressed in KS lesions, implicating a direct role of KSHV in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. Several KSHV genes are involved in KSHV-induced angiogenesis. These studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of KS, and identified potential therapeutic targets for this malignancy.","985":"The glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola is the sole structural protein that forms the spikes on the viral envelope. The GP contains two subunits, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In this study, the full length of GP gene of Ebola Zaire species, 2028 base pairs in length, was synthesized using 38 overlapping oligonucleotides by multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The synthesized GP gene was shown to be efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system was developed using the synthetic GP gene, providing a safe approach to dissecting the entry mechanism of Ebola viruses. Using this pseudotyping system and mutational analysis, the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions was examined. It was found that substitutions of the most charged residues in the regions did not adversely affect GP expression, processing, or viral incorporation, however, most of the mutations greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate efficient viral infection. These results demonstrate that these charged residues of GP2 play an important role in GP-mediated Ebola entry into its host cells. We propose that these charged residues are involved in forming the intermediate conformation(s) of GP in membrane fusion and Ebola entry."},"articletitle":{"0":"Saliva-based point-of-care testing
