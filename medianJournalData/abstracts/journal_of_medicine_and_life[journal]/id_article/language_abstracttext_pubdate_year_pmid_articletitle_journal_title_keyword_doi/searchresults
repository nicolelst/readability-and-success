Covid-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on global health, social and economic well-being worldwide. In addition to the direct effects of the disease on patients infected with the virus, this pandemic has severely affected the activity of surgical clinics around the world. One of the significant issues was an important decrease in the number of surgeries performed even in countries with highly performant medical systems. This study aimed to analyze the effects of the pandemic on the 1st General Surgery Clinic in Timisoara County Hospital, compared to 2018-2019. In order to conduct this study, data regarding the activity of the clinic in the pandemic period and 2018-2019 was collected and analyzed from a statistical point of view, considering a p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant. There were significant differences between the 2 periods regarding the number of hospitalized patients, the number of patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery, and the total number of surgeries performed. Due to the restrictions imposed, there was an increase in the average monthly mortality rate and a decrease in the average length of hospital stay. Covid-19 pandemic led to a severe activity restriction of the surgery clinics due to the restrictions imposed by the authorities and the reorganization of the clinics to comply with the epidemiological requirements. Also, the limitation of patients' access to surgical treatment and their fear of coming in contact with the hospital environment led to their presentation in more advanced stages of the disease, with more severe symptoms and a higher mortality rate during the pandemic.","1":"Echinococcosis is a parasitic infestation with high prevalence in Iraq. Surgical treatment remains the standard gold method for treating this disease. The selection of surgical approach depends on the general condition of the patient and characters of the cyst, e.g., size, location, number of cysts, intraoperative findings, and complications such as adhesion, bile leakage, and bleeding. Our study aimed (1) to summarize the most common surgical approaches for treating liver hydatid cyst (HC) in our locality, and (2) to highlight common intraoperative and postoperative complications and the duration of hospital stay. We analyzed the clinical data of 42 patients operated for liver HC. We found that the highest incidence rate of HC was anatomically in the right hepatic lobe with or without synchronous cysts in other organs. The most frequent type of surgery was partial pericystectomy with external tube drainage (ETD) or simple endocystectomy with omentoplasty and ETD. The most important intraoperative finding was cystic-biliary communication. The majority of patients had uneventful postoperative recovery. There is no standardized surgical procedure for hepatic HC. The surgical technique should be modified according to the cyst size, anatomic location of cyst\/cysts, number of cysts, cystobiliary communications, cystic infection, and the presence of extrahepatic hydatid cyst or cysts. The surgeon's experience plays a vital role in selecting the surgical technique for hepatic hydatid cystectomy.","2":"Fungal flora is one of the causes of inflammatory, including polypous, processes in the nasal cavity. In this regard, studies aimed at reducing the effect of fungal sensitization (FS) on the course of chronic polypous rhinosinusitis (CPRS) are relevant. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of various treatment options on the clinical course of the disease in patients with chronic polypous rhinosinusitis against the background of sensitization to fungi. The study included 90 patients with chronic polypous rhinosinusitis in combination with FS. The patients were divided into two groups - the first clinical group (G1) and the second clinical group (G2). G1 patients received allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) according to the scheme. G2 patients received basic treatment. Evaluation of the clinical efficiency of ASIT was made based on complaints, assessment of symptom severity on a visual analog scale (VAS), and rhinoendoscopic examination. The treatment outcomes were evaluated on a 4-point scale, with excellent results (4 points) - complete remission of the disease during the follow-up period (6-12 months); good (3 points) - exacerbation of the disease 1-2 times a year, in mild form and removed by expectant treatment; satisfactory (2 points) - the number of exacerbations did not decrease. The use of ASIT therapy is pathogenetically justified and leads to a significant improvement in the clinical condition of patients with CPRS with FS.","3":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical need and impact of socket preservation to protect the bone for future dental implant placement. Moreover, we aimed to list down various methods of socket preservation by going through randomized clinical trials. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases for all relevant publications, where researchers compared various methods and tools for socket preservation. All eight randomized controlled trials mentioned several methods that are helpful in preserving bone levels both horizontally and vertically. The studies included in this systematic review demonstrate that each material has certain efficacy in preserving the socket after tooth extraction for future implant placement. Socket preservation methods and materials are effective in preparing patients for future prostheses.","4":"Nitrosamines are carcinogenic agents which can unfavorably affect some male reproductive parameters. Humans are exposed to nitrosamines through various routes, the most important of which is the diet. Crocin is a carotenoid and is accountable for the red color of saffron. Crocin has numerous pharmacological actions, such as antioxidant roles and radical scavenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Crocin against Nitrosamine - induced damage to the reproductive parameter of male rats. In this experimental study, 48 male rats were randomly assigned to 8 groups: control normal and Nitrosamine control groups (40 mg\/kg); Crocin (12.5, 25, and 50 mg\/kg) and Nitrosamine + Crocin (12.5, 25, and 50 mg\/kg). Treatments were administered intraperitoneally and gavaged daily for 28 days. The sperm parameters, total antioxidant capacity, testosterone level, and seminiferous tube diameter were assessed. Nitrosamine significantly decreased sperm parameters (p&lt;0.001). The Crocin and Crocin + Nitrosamine treatments at complete doses significantly improved all parameters (p&lt;0.001). Crocin compensated for the toxic effect of Nitrosamine on reproductive parameters.","5":"This research aims to identify the predictive factors related to the initiation and sustaining of regular physical activity behaviors and their influence in adapting to menopausal symptoms. The study uses the multi-theory model (MTM) as the conceptual framework. The descriptive cross-sectional research was conducted on 200 post-menopausal women aged 45-55 years. All participants were referred to health centers, where they completed a three-part questionnaire involving: demographic information, a questionnaire on the influence of regular physical activity on the onset and sustaining of menopause using the MTM, and a standard questionnaire of menopausal quality of life. Data were collected, managed, and analyzed using SPSS 20 and AMOS 23 software. This study reveals that behavioral confidence and changes in the physical environment with coefficients of 0.55 and 0.14 respectively had a direct and significant impact on the initiation of regular physical activity-related behaviors during menopause. The construct of participatory dialogue had no significant impact on the initiation of regular physical activity-related behaviors and menopause. Regarding the sustainability of regular physical activity, the emotional transformation construct with a coefficient of 0.73 and change in social environment construct with a coefficient of 0.11 directly and significantly impact keeping regular physical activity behaviors due to menopause. Therefore, interventions based on the MTM can prove very useful for this specific population. In addition, the use of constructs validated by this study will especially be useful in producing evidence-based intervention for the target population.","6":"In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, the first cases of infection with SARS-CoV 2 responsible for COVID-19 disease were identified. SARS-CoV 2 was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and since then has attracted the medical world's attention. The threat to humans' health that this emerging pandemic could leave raises awareness on the importance of understanding the mechanisms that underlie the developing conditions. The epidemiology, clinical picture, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 show that this virus presents new strategies to overcome the past defensive medicine. While all the current data has focused on the pulmonary and cardiovascular manifestations, little has been written about the neurological implications of the disease. This review updates new clinical aspects that SARS-CoV 2 expresses in humans by focusing primarily on neurological manifestations. The damage to the nervous system became more apparent - anosmia, ageusia, polyneuritis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis, stroke, acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Oxygen therapy is vital for those in critical health situations. Finally, prevention is the most important element in breaking the epidemiological chain.","7":"According to Saudi Arabia's 2030 vision, research should be directed to prevention, early detection, and intervention to reduce all types of disability. The current study aimed to investigate the predictors of Premarital Screening and Genetic Counseling (PMSGC) knowledge and attitude among deaf and hard hearing females' in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Descriptive correlational design was conducted on a convenience sample of 67 deaf and hard hearing students from the Tabuk region. Data were collected by an electronic questionnaire elaborated to the participants using sign language. The results revealed that most participants had incorrect answers regarding most PMSGC questions. Around two-thirds (68.7%, 65.7%, and 71.6%) of them strongly agree that PMSGC is very important, compatible with Islamic principles, and prevents family social and psychological problems, respectively. Older, urban area residents and university-educated participants have significantly higher knowledge and attitude scores than their peers (t=2.239, 4.887, 4.790 &amp; p&lt;0.05), respectively. Multiple regression shows that age (b=0.302, t=-2.795, p=0.007), education (b=0.336, t=2.425, p=0.019), mothers' education (b=0.314, t=2.345, p=0.023), and monthly income (b=-0.337, t=-2.503, p=0.015), are significant predictors of PMSGC knowledge. Furthermore, age (b=0.659, t=4.024, p=0.000), residence (b=0.293, t=2.233, p=0.030), education (b=-0.395, t=3.028, p=0.004), and type of disability (b=-0.443, t=-3.763, p=0.000) are significant predictors of PMSGC attitude. Although most deaf and hard hearing females have incorrect knowledge regarding PMSGC, most have a positive attitude. The study concluded that participants' education, mothers' education, and monthly income are significant predictors of PMSGC knowledge. Moreover, age, residence, education, and type of disability were significant predictors of higher PMSGC attitudes.","8":"This study aimed to evaluate metformin as a widely used oral hypoglycemic agent and identify the effects on biochemical and antioxidant body systems of rabbits. Four groups of rabbits were randomly allocated as the control, the alloxan-induced diabetic, metformin-treated, and alloxan treated with metformin. The results revealed that alloxan leads to significant elevation in glucose (Glc) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TCH), and a significant decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and glutathione (GSH) as compared with the control group. Metformin alone caused a significant decline in Glc and HDL with significant elevation in LDL and MDA without significant changes in TCH, TGs, VLDL, and GSH. When metformin was offered as a treatment for alloxan-induced diabetic animals, it caused a significant decline in Glc, TCH, TGs, LDL, and VLDL levels with significant elevation in GSH and without a significant change in HDL and MDA. Metformin causes a decline in glucose levels due to its ability to decrease the use of substances hepatic cells use to create glucose and its ability to induce the enzymes participating in glucose oxidation.","9":"Endometrial pathology, including hyperplastic processes in the structure of reproductive disorders, occupies one of the leading places along with inflammatory diseases of the pelvic organs, contributing to infertility in 80% of cases and irregular menstrual cycle in 40-43%. This study aims to optimize the diagnostic algorithm in patients with endometrial hyperplasia combined with chronic endometritis and determine qualitative indicators of compression sonoelastography in patients with endometrial pathology and infertility. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory examination of 90 infertile patients aged 25 to 45 years with endometrial hyperplasia combined with chronic inflammation, retention cysts, and benign ovarian tumors was carried out. The results of clinical-laboratory and complex ultrasound examination with compression sonoelastography were compared with the data of pathomorphological and immunohistochemical studies. A high percentage of pelvic inflammatory disease (55.0%), benign lesions of the cervix (67.5%), hyperplastic processes of the myometrium (37.5%), an increasing number of polyps by 2.9 times, leiomyomas and adenomyosis - by 2.3 times (p&lt;0.05) was established. In the case of a combination of endometrial hyperplasia and ovarian cysts, a high percentage of comorbidity of gynecological pathology is verified (37.8%), and the use of compression sonoelastography allows to establish class II and class III elastograms in 91.1% of cases which characterize benign endometrial lesions, reduce the number of false-positive results in 95.6% of cases, correctly interpret the nature of pathological changes and increase the sensitivity of ultrasound techniques.","10":"The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously increased the production and sales of disinfectants. This study aimed to systematically review and analyze the efficacy and safety of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant. The literature relating to the use of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant was systematically reviewed in January 2021 using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were studies that investigated the use of chlorine dioxide to assess the efficacy, safety, and impact of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant. Out of the 33 included studies, 14 studies focused on the disinfectant efficacy of chlorine dioxide, 8 studies expounded on the safety and toxicity in humans and animals, and 15 studies discussed the impact, such as water treatment disinfection using chlorine dioxide. Chlorine dioxide is a safe and effective disinfectant, even at concentrations as low as 20 to 30 mg\/L. Moreover, the efficacy of chlorine dioxide is mostly independent of pH. Chlorine dioxide can be effectively used to disinfect drinking water without much alteration of palatability and can also be used to destroy pathogenic microbes, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi from vegetables and fruits. Our review confirms that chlorine dioxide is effective against the resistant Mycobacterium, H1N1, and other influenza viruses. Studies generally support the use of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant. The concentration deemed safe for usage still needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis.","11":"Pregnancy is a unique condition for women, associated with physiological and emotional changes in the body. Various research showed an association between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Importance to hygiene maintenance should be given during pregnancy and improve the wellbeing of the mother and child. This study assessed oral health knowledge, attitude, and practices among pregnant women in Hyderabad. The study design was cross-sectional and included 445 women who responded and completed the survey. Subjects were selected using a random sampling technique in gynecology clinics. The questionnaire form consisted of four sections: demographic data, knowledge, attitude, and oral hygiene practice. Out of the 482 pregnant females invited to participate in the study, 445 women completed the survey, giving a response rate of 92%. The majority of women showed good knowledge and attitude regarding oral hygiene and its relation to pregnancy. However, the participants showed poor compliance with the recommended protocol. There are certain myths and barriers to dental treatment that need to be considered in the prenatal education of women. If explained by the gynecologist, the importance of oral health and its correlation with systemic health will play a crucial role in improving oral hygiene practice and regular dental visits.","12":"This study aimed to assess vitamin D status and its association with iron status in young Iraqi children. A total of 95 infants and toddlers with iron deficiency (ages ranging from 6 to 24 months) and an equal number of 95 healthy subjects with normal hemoglobin (Hb) and sufficient ferritin level with matching age were included as a control group. A specially designed questionnaire was used to collect data. The cases were classified into iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) according to hemoglobin and ferritin levels. The cases and control groups were subdivided into vitamin insufficiency (VDI), vitamin D deficiency (VDD), and vitamin D sufficiency groups according to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Young children with IDA have significantly lower serum levels of 25(OH) D compared with ID and control groups (p&lt;0.05). According to iron status, VDI and VDD were present in 20% and 70% of IDA, 25.7% and 60%of ID, and 26.3% and 30.5% of control groups, respectively, with a significant difference in vitamin D level (p&lt;0.05) among studied groups. A significant positive correlation (p=0.000) was found between serum ferritin level and 25(OH) D level in studied patients. Young children with severe iron deficiency have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and there was a significant positive correlation between serum ferritin level and 25(OH) D levels among studied children.","13":"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is an RNA virus similar to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the replication process. Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir is an approved drug to treat HCV infection. This study investigates the efficacy of Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir as a treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. This is a single-blinded parallel-randomized controlled trial. The participants were randomized equally into the intervention group that received Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir (S.L. group), and the control group received Oseltamivir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Azithromycin (OCH group). The primary outcomes were the cure rate over time and the incidence of serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes included the laboratory findings. 250 patients were divided equally into each group. Both groups were similar regarding gender, but age was higher in the S.L. group (p=0.001). In the S.L. group, 89 (71.2%) patients were cured, while only 51 (40.8%) patients were cured in the OCH group. The cure rate was significantly higher in the S.L. group (RR=1.75, p&lt;0.001). Kaplan-Meir plot showed a considerably higher cure over time in the S.L. group (Log-rank test, p=0.032). There were no deaths in the S.L. group, but there were six deaths (4.8%) in the OCH group (RR=0.08, p=0.013). Seven patients (5.6%) in the S.L. group and six patients (4.8%) in the OCH group were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (RR=1.17, P=0.776). There were no significant differences between treatment groups regarding total leukocyte and neutrophils count, lymph, and urea. Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir is suggestive of being effective in treating patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to compare Sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir with new treatment protocols.","14":"Malaria is the most severe protozoan disease in the world. As a result of strict malaria control programs, malaria's epidemiological model has changed. Knowing this epidemiological model and its effects will help us predict and prevent a new epidemic. This research was conducted to review the epidemiological trend of malaria in the Kermanshah province of Iran and some of its effective factors. Data were extracted from the registers in the disease control unit of the province, national population census, and annual rainfall report. The data was processed by SPSS16. There has been an evident decrease in malaria cases over the last 30 years in Kermanshah. This decreasing trend began especially after 1994, and since then, just 6% of all cases have happened. Between 1990 to 1997, an epidemic occurred, and more than 80% of positive cases were registered in these years. P. vivax malaria was the most common type (99.32%), and P. falciparum malaria was the second, with a very egregious difference (0.68%). The average age was 23.1 years, and men were infected twice more than women. There was a positive relation between annual rainfall level and positive malaria cases in these cities. After the major changes in malaria control programs in Kermanshah province, the number of positive cases fell noticeably, and now it is in the elimination stage. All cases of malaria were imported in the last years, and no resistance type was ever seen.","15":"This study aimed to assess the association of obesity with the severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. A retrospective observational study was performed from March to September 2020 in Saudi Arabia. Baseline and laboratory data were collected from the inpatient health record system. The cohort was divided into three groups based on body mass index. Following this, the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease were analyzed between the three groups. Of the 502 COVID-19 cases included, 244 (48.5%) were obese. Obesity was significantly associated with severe (53.5%) or critical (28%) COVID-19 infection (P&lt;0.001) and a higher need for ICU admission (35.8%, P=0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that overweight\/obesity was an independent risk factor of severe (P&lt;0.001) as well as critical COVID-19 infection (P=0.026, respectively) and a predictor of a higher risk of ICU admission (P=0.012). Class I obesity was associated with severe-critical COVID-19 disease (33.6%, P=0.042) compared to other obesity classes. Obesity is an independent risk factor for severe-critical COVID-19 infection and a higher risk of ICU admission. Clinicians should give special attention to such populations and prioritize vaccination programs to improve outcomes.","16":"Antimicrobials are widely used to treat bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Therefore, research and development of newer types of antimicrobials are important. Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major challenge to the healthcare system, although various alternative antimicrobials have been proposed. However, none of these show consistent and comparable efficacy to antimicrobials in clinical trials. More recently, nanoparticles have emerged as a potential solution to antimicrobial agents to overcome antimicrobial resistance. This article revisits and updates applications of various types of nanoparticles for the delivery of antimicrobial agents and their characterization. Though nanoparticle technology has some limitations, it provides an innovative approach to pharmaceutical technology. Furthermore, nanoparticles offer a variety of advantages, such as enhancement of solubility and permeation, leading to better efficacy. In this article, approaches commonly employed to improve antimicrobial therapy are discussed. These approaches have advantages and applications and provide a broader opportunity for pharmaceutical scientists to choose the proper method per the desired outcome.","17":"","18":"This study reviewed the current literature on technical aspects regarding controlled vocal fold injuries in the rat model. Data from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus database for English language literature was collected to identify methodological steps leading to a controlled surgical injury of the rat vocal fold. Inclusion criteria: full disclosure of anesthesia protocol, positioning of the rat for surgery, vocal fold visualization method, instrumentation for vocal fold injury, vocal fold injury type. Articles with partial contribution were evaluated and separately included due to the limited number of original methodologies. 724 articles were screened, and eleven articles were included in the analysis. Anesthesia: ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride varied in dose from 45 mg\/kg and 4.5 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg. Visualization: The preferred method was the 1.9 mm, 25-30 degree endoscopes. The widest diameter endoscope used was 2.7 mm with a 0 or 30 degree angle of view. Instruments for lesion induction range from 18 to 31G needles, microscissors, micro forceps to potassium titanyl phosphate, and blue light lasers. Injury types: vocal fold stripping was the main injury type, followed by vocal fold scarring and charring. One article describes scaffold implantation with injury to the superior aspect of the vocal fold. Rats are good candidates for in vivo larynx and vocal folds research. A more standardized approach should be considered regarding the type of vocal fold injury to ease data comparison.","19":"Bone modifying agents (BMA) like bisphosphonates, antiangiogenic, and antiresorptive agents are widely used to manage bone diseases and cancer. Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a potentially serious complication seen in patients on BMA therapy. Dental infection is one of the primary risk factors for MRONJ manifestation; hence its complete removal before initiation of BMA is significant. This can be achieved when a medical professional understands MRONJ and its risk factors and implements timely and regular dental referrals. This multicentre study was performed to assess the knowledge about MRONJ and awareness about the implementation of dental referrals among medical professionals. A custom-designed questionnaire tool was designed and validated by a pilot study. 450 practitioners from 6 medical schools and private practitioners in and around the district were surveyed. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 63.5% (n=80) of the respondents prescribed bisphosphonates at a frequency of 0-5 times in a month. However, 62% (n=78) of the practitioners could correctly indicate the most appropriate definition of MRONJ. Only 49.2% (n=62) of them considered dental consultation mandatory. 73% (n=92) of the practitioners were unaware of management guidelines. There exists a significant gap in the knowledge-based applications in the management of MRONJ. Lack of referrals to dentists before BMA therapy can be a pivotal factor in patient morbidity. Practitioners prescribing BMA should advise patients about regular dental visits and monitor for symptoms of MRONJ.","20":"The article aims to identify the main problems in treating urological pathologies by analyzing scientific literature from this field and developing recommendations. The quantitative excretion of uric acid, urine volume, and pH are essential in the formation of uric acid stones. The most important risk factor for uric acid nephrolithiasis is the acidic reaction of urine, which is a prerequisite for the formation of urinary stones. When urine is alkalized, the pH should be 6-6.5. Drugs alkalize urine, and one should titrate using urine pH indicator paper until the level is stable. This study found that the spread of genitourinary diseases is increasing. This situation can be improved by monitoring and assessing epidemiological processes, preventing urological pathology, and optimizing medical care organization in the context of health care reform.","21":"121 bacterial samples isolated from wounds from both sexes and all age groups were collected from Salahadin General Hospital, Salahadin provenance, Iraq. Only 8 Staphylococcus sciuri (S. sciuri) isolates were identified. The bacterial isolation showed the highest sensitivity to Amoxicillin\/Clavulanic acid, Cefotaxime, Methicillin, Streptomycin, and Vancomycin and resistance to all other antibiotics. The root exudates of black seeds were used for 10 and 20 days for both treatments with and without magnetized water, and the exudates were superior when using magnetized water for 20 days. Antibiotic resistance and the mecA gene were investigated, and a multiplex PCR assay was used to detect the mecA gene in S. sciuri. Optimized conditions were used to amplify mecA fragments that encode methicillin resistance.","22":"The study involved clinical and laboratory examination of 54 women with vasomotor menopausal disorders divided into 3 subgroups depending on the duration of symptoms (not more than 12 months, about 3 years, from 5 to 7 years). The control group included 21 patients without vasomotor disorders during the menopausal period. Data from the general and obstetric-gynecological anamnesis and the results of objective and general clinical examinations were analyzed. To assess the state of intestinal microbiocenosis in patients, a bacteriological study of feces was used according to modern methods. In women with menopausal vasomotor disorders, chronic arterial hypertension, overweight, diabetes mellitus, chronic enterocolitis, and chronic pyelonephritis prevailed among somatic diseases. The study also revealed that these patients had a pronounced imbalance of the intensive microbiota, which was characterized by a significant decrease in the main representatives of the obligate microflora (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus) and an increase in the number of opportunistic strains (Klebsiella and Clostridiodes difficile). Considering modern concepts, a change in the microbial composition of the intestine may be one of the possible trigger factors for the occurrence of vasomotor menopausal disorders. Further research will clarify the influence of the microbiome on the formation of the pathological menopausal symptom complex and improve the preventive and therapeutic measures in this category of women.","23":"","24":"The number of clubfoot new cases in Romania is on the rise. According to orthopedic research, the Ponseti method is the elective treatment for clubfeet. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current facilitators and barriers in accessing clubfoot treatment services in Romania and to assess the impact of care-related factors on patients' well-being. Our research shows that nationally, few orthopedic surgeons are using the Ponseti method and most of them are concentrated only in Cluj-Napoca. Moreover, gynecologists, neonatologists, and family physicians were not informed about the initial diagnosis and the current treatment of clubfoot. Primary medical care was significantly postponed in some cases. Moreover, no clubfoot organizations were mentioned by the parents included in the study, and psychological support was provided neither for the parents nor for the children. Based on the results of our study, we conclude that more efforts need to be done for the diagnosis and treatment of children with clubfeet. These include actions which are focused on raising awareness around this abnormality and more well-developed treatment guidelines.","25":null,"26":"Avicenna used his medical knowledge and experience of scientists from different nations to create a new style in medicine. For this reason, his textbook, Canon of Medicine, has been considered a medical reference in all universities worldwide for centuries. In this article, some valuable and interesting diagnostic and therapeutic clinical experiences mentioned in the Canon of Medicine are described in five sections. This research was conducted to review Avicenna's specific clinical observations and interventions in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases using the keywords \"Avicenna\" and \"Canon of Medicine\". In this article, we presented several examples of diagnostic and therapeutic clinical experiences mentioned in the Canon of Medicine in 5 areas, including semiology, therapeutic strategy, urology, neurology, obstetrics, and gynecology. Canon of Medicine, as a complete medical series containing the medical experiences from different nations and Iranian medical scientists, has influenced the world's medical knowledge for several centuries.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term PR program in patients with comorbid asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obesity. We included 40 ACO patients and divided them into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI) and then subdivided them into PR (n=21) and control (n=19) groups. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT), the Asthma Control Test (ACT), and the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRS) were used to evaluate symptoms levels. BODE index (body mass index, forced expiratory volume in one second, dyspnoea, and 6-min walk distance) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition, spirometry and bioimpedansometry were performed. All measurements were done before and after a 6-month PR program. A significantly lower decline in the BODE index was observed in overweight patients (decreased by 43.6% compared to baseline and lower by 40.7% compared to the control group). The six-minute walking test (6MWT) significantly increased in all groups (p&lt;0.001). There was a decrease in total CAT score by 25.4% and by 31.2% in the overweight group (p&lt;0.001). The BMI decreased more in the obese group (by 9.4% compared to baseline). Our study result showed that early use of PR program significantly improves functional capacity and BODE index, leads to dyspnea and CAT scores reduction and improvement in pulmonary function, cause a decrease in BMI, body fat percentage, and visceral fat level, and an increase in muscle mass in overweight and obese patients with ACO.","29":"The study aims to add a new and beneficial perspective using Immunoinstant G food supplement as an adjuvant treatment. It is essential to study the bibliographic resources in the field to identify the current stage of knowledge on this topic. For this purpose, we have prepared a systematic literature review, focusing on the possibilities of improving the treatment of Clostridium difficile (Clostridioides difficile) enterocolitis in patients who need\/benefit from neurorehabilitation. The systematic literature review was prepared using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We obtained a number of 6 articles that were considered in the elaboration of our systematic literature review. We identified that this field is insufficiently studied and needs additional clinical trials. Our study contributes to increasing this understanding based on the thorough theoretical and practical approach of this topic.","30":"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by the novel enveloped single-stranded RNA virus quickly declared a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with blood group type A. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Amal specialized hospital, Al-Najaf (March 8 to March 20\/2021). The study included 123 hospitalized patients (63 females and 60 males), aged between 15-95 years, diagnosed with COVID-19, tested for blood group, blood sugar, blood urea, D-dimer, and serum ferritin. Results indicated significant differences in blood sugar and D-dimer in patients with type A blood group at P&gt;0.05. At the same time, no significant difference was found in blood urea and ferritin at P&gt;0.05. The majority of patients showed elevated levels of blood sugar, blood urea, serum D-dimer and ferritin. COVID-19 can infect people of all ages and causes severe infection in all blood groups.","31":null,"32":"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses prescribe medication for patients in many countries. However, there is still no evidence on the legitimacy of nurse prescribing roles in the healthcare system of Iran. This qualitative study with 30 experts was conducted to explore the experiences regarding the expanding role of prescribing medication by the ICU nurses. Data were collected through 31 individual semi-structured interviews and analyzed using the conventional content analysis method by MAXQDA 10. One major theme, \"applicability of prescribing medication by ICU nurses\", together with three sub-themes of \"facilitators\", \"potential risks of nurse prescribing\" and \"the professional pathway\", emerged. The use of successful global experiences, patient-oriented healthcare system policies, current culture and positive professional position of nurses, physician shortage, and high capacity of ICU nurses appeared as facilitators to perform the new role in our context. For the expansion of the new role, different professional pathways such as discussion with physicians and special groups with conflicts of interests, training qualified nurses in this area, and gradual development were proposed by the participants. The next step of the research is to prepare a set of standards for the prescription of medication by the ICU nurses in our context.","33":"Cytokeratin19 (CK19) was detected as the most related marker for circulating tumor cells, which was assessed in specific cell lines. MCF7, SKBR3, T47D, and MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cell line as negative control were used. CK19 expression was confirmed by using mouse monoclonal anti-human CK19 antibody. CK19 detection in MDA-MB-231 was not observed. CK19 marker expression was compared in T47D, MCF7, and SKBR3 cell lines. T47D and MCF7 belonged to the luminal subtype of breast cancer (BC) that CK19 expression regulated with an ER marker. SKBR3 belonged to the HER2 positive subtype of BC. However, MDA-MB-231 belonged to the claudin-low subtype of BC that lack of CK19 expression strongly is related to negative ER, PR, and HER2. Therefore, there are not only quantitative differences in CK19 expression, but its expression could also link to the other markers of BC that should be considered in the molecular classification of breast carcinoma. Different expression levels related to cell classification could be useful in the prognosis and treatment of cancers with epithelial origins.","34":"Y-chromosome DNA profiles are promising tools in population genetics and forensic science. Analysis of Y-chromosome variety was performed on a total of 191 unrelated males throughout different regions in Basrah. The Y-chromosome variety was explored utilizing 17 markers system. For the uniparental system, the large majority of the haplogroups observed in the Basrah population are (R1b, E1b1b, G2a, and J1) considered to have begun in the Middle East and to have later spread all over Western Eurasia. 30% of the Y-chromosomes, in all likelihood, represent landings from inaccessible distant geographic regions. The level of haplotype diversity and its implication for statistics are evaluated. The distinctive extent of long go genetic input observed for the Y chromosome shows that gene flow events to this area might have involved mainly males.","35":null,"36":"The hybrid method of treating thoracic aortic pathology is devoid of the disadvantages of traditional open surgery and, at the same time, has a broader range of applications than the endovascular method. From 2014 to 2019, we researched 122 patients with thoracic aortic pathology treated with the hybrid method (open surgery with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) at the National M. Amosov Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery National Academy of Medical Science of Ukraine. In the general group, 34 patients had a descending aortic aneurysm without dissection or rupture; 71 patients had an aortic dissection (10 - acute, 9 - subacute, 52 - chronic), penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) - 7, thoracoabdominal aneurysm (Crawford I-II) - 4, isolated aortic arch aneurysm - 2, residual enlargement aorta after previous ascending aortic grafting causing type A acute aortic dissection (TAAD) - 3, primary aortic thrombosis - 1. Patients admitted as elective surgery candidates had switched aortic arch vessels (debranching) in the first stage and TEVAR in the second stage. For emergencies (aortic rupture with uncontrolled bleeding, malperfusion syndrome), TEVAR operation was performed first. Long-term results of treatment after three and six months are satisfactory. The hybrid technique of aortic arch treatment using modern minimally invasive technologies can eliminate the pathology in the most dangerous segment of the main artery of the body, providing a reasonable level of hospital mortality - 4.2%, and a small number of neurological complications.","37":null,"38":null,"39":"Selenium, manganese, and calcium are necessary elements for maintaining normal growth and skeleton formation. Kashin-Beck disease mostly occurs in children, resulting in deformities, dwarfism, and disabilities. Selenium deficiency was considered a risk factor in China, while manganese was reportedly involved in it in Russia. Single-element regulation cannot be used in diagnosis because of unclear boundaries in patients compared to healthy individuals. In this study, new indices of elements were designed to predict the status of disease. MS (Mn\/Se), CS (Ca'\/Se), and MC (Mn\/Ca') values were designed, and prediction formulas were generated by comparing healthy children with those with Kashin-Beck disease via multiple linear regression analysis and discriminant analysis. In the disease group, 42.86% of patients had positive MS, CS, and MC values, and 57.14% of patients had positive MS and CS values. In the treatment group, the patients presented improved indices. In the prediction group, subjects with negative clinical criteria features were predicted by new indices, and 26.67% of them presented with positive MS, CS, and MC values, whereas 40.00% had positive MS and CS values. The 3D model of MS, CS, and MC refers to the setup of elements. The MS, CS, and MC indices are helpful in disease prediction, diagnosis, prognosis, and surveillance. The distribution model of the indices could serve in the growth surveillance of children.","40":"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the most common cause of death in working-age women. According to the results of immunohistochemical studies, 10-20% of cases revealed a triple-negative type of breast cancer. This subtype is characterized by significant proliferative activity and growth rate, aggressive clinical course, and early metastasis. This leads to a suspicious prognosis and, accordingly, encourages an increase of surgical treatment radicalism and aggressive systemic treatment. This review briefly analyzes existing treatment strategies for triple-negative breast cancer with a focus on surgical treatment. Surgical treatment is an integral part of complex therapy. Currently, the attention of researchers is focused not only on the radicalism of the operation, ensuring long-term survival, but also on achieving a good cosmetic result that determines the quality of life of patients. In this aspect, organ-preserving and prosthetic methods of operations are promising, the feasibility and effectiveness of which are being discussed. The relevance of choosing the optimal method of operation is evidenced by the lack of generally accepted approaches based on informative markers for the prognosis of the course of the disease. Therefore, the choice of the optimal method of surgical treatment taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient and the tumor, indications for chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remains an unresolved issue and requires further research.","41":null,"42":"","43":"Many aspects make irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) challenging for both patients and physicians. The unclear pathogenesis with many pathways to be explored, bothering symptoms that affect the quality of life, and many subtypes of the condition are only a few reasons that make IBS difficult to control and obtain satisfactory results. Treatment options start with general advice for lifestyle, continue with non-pharmaceutical treatments, and finally touch classic treatments. In this review, pharmaceutical treatment options are not accounted for. Consensus groups and meta-analyses have concluded guidelines that overall are the same, with variations in the strength of recommendations and some cultural and geographical particularities. Dietary interventions, probiotics, and fibers can be seen as non-pharmaceutical treatments that coexist in various protocols because of the relevant evidence regarding their efficacy in treating IBS symptoms.","44":null,"45":"","46":null,"47":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer, with an increasing incidence in recent years. The prognosis is unfavorable, representing the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide. This is because it generally develops in patients with pre-existing liver pathology, thus limiting therapeutic options. The role of ablative therapies is well-established in nodules smaller than 3 cm, but for nodules from 3 to 5 cm, the best therapeutic management is not well defined. Recent studies reported that combining minimally invasive procedures like transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation is superior to each alone. However, there is no consensus regarding the timing and the order in which each procedure should be performed. We report a case of an 86 years old male with HCV-related compensated hepatic cirrhosis and multiple cardiac comorbidities diagnosed with a 47\/50 mm HCC. Pre-surgical evaluation of the associated pathologies determined that the risk for the surgical approach outweighs the benefits, so the committee decided to treat it in a less invasive manner. We performed MWA and TACE in a single session with technical success according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (m-RECIST). This case illustrates the first case of simultaneous MWA and TACE performed in our center. This new approach of hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be a good alternative to more invasive methods, with good results even in older people that are unfit for surgery.","48":null,"49":"This study was designed to investigate the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the reproductive performance of premature male rats and to evaluate the influence of L-Carnitine (CAR) in maintaining their fertility.

Results showed a significant increase in body weight of CFG1 compared with CG and CFG2. The lipid profile of CFG1 after one month of feeding cholesterol showed a significant increase in serum cholesterol and triglyceride compared with CG and with the group that watered by CAR and CFG2. Results of sperms parameters in CGF2 showed a significant increase in sperms count with sperms live percentage and a significant decrease in sperms abnormalities percentage compared with CGF1 and CG. The hormonal profile showed a significant decrease in serum testosterone levels in rats from CFG1 compared with CFG2 and CG. In conclusion, CAR is a powerful antioxidant that can maintain the parameters of sperms of hypercholesterolemic premature rats, which may enhance the fertilizing ability of subfertile rats that may occur due to hyperlipidemia.","50":"Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a potential cause for recurrence, metastasis, and resistance of tumors to different therapeutic modalities like hormonal radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We investigated two CSC markers (NANOG and CD 133) in normal, hyperplastic endometrium and endometrial carcinoma. A total of 93 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were used for immunohistochemical expression of NANOG and CD133 markers. NANOG expression was detected in 88.37% of endometrial carcinoma cases compared to 15% of the normal proliferative endometrium and 60% of hyperplasia cases. In endometrial carcinoma, high NANOG expression was significantly correlated with high grade, deep myometrial invasion, lymph node metastasis, and high stage with p-values (0.009, 0.005, 0.014, and 0.003, respectively). CD133 was positive in 76.74% of endometrial carcinoma cases, and it showed a significant correlation with deep myometrial invasion, positive lymph node, positive lymphovascular invasion, and high stage (p-values 0.003, 0.001, 0.003, and 0.013, respectively). Normal endometrium showed less expression of CD133 (only 5%) than hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma with a statistically highly significant difference (p less than 0.0001). Hyperplastic cases with atypia expressed higher CD133 than those without atypia (6 out of 12 versus 3 out of 18). However, this difference was not statistically significant (p-value 0.111). The cancer stem cell markers NANOG and CD 133 are expressed in a high percentage in endometrial carcinoma compared to normal and hyperplasia and their expression is positively correlated with the aggressive behavior of the tumor. High expression of these two markers in apparently normal tissue around the tumor and in hyperplastic conditions with atypia suggests the possibility to use NANOG and CD133 expression as a diagnostic marker distinguishing dysplasia from reactive atypia. Therefore, inhibition of these markers can be a promising method to stop the progression of early cancers.","51":"The article discusses a new hypothesis that autoimmune diseases of the thyroid gland can lead to depression and neurological complications. It is believed that the neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor plays a significant role in depression pathophysiology and neurological and mental diseases, respectively. The study involved 153 patients with various forms of thyroid pathology. GRIN2B levels in the sera of the patients and healthy individuals were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with highly sensitive Human GRIN2B (Glutamate Receptor, Ionotropic, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate 2B) ELISA Kit. Genotyping of the glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 1, GRIN1 (rs4880213) gene polymorphism. The CT genotype of the NMDA gene (rs4880213) was predominant in the surveyed population. The C allele of the NMDA gene was more frequent than the T allele among patients with thyroid disease. GRIN2B levels were significantly decreased in patients with postoperative hypothyroidism 3.45 times, and in patients with AIT-induced hypothyroidism, there was a probable increase in GRIN2B levels by 1.58 times compared with controls. GRIN2B levels were significantly different in patients of different groups depending on thyroid pathology. Our study showed direct close correlation (r=0.635) between GRIN2B and anti-TPO levels (p&lt;0.001), a significant direct close correlation (r=0.527) between GRIN2B and anti-TG levels in the blood (p&lt;0.001). Our results allow us to consider the GRIN2B level as an important prognostic minimally invasive marker of neurological complications in endocrine pathology.","52":"Hypothyroidism is the most common long-term consequence after total thyroidectomy. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the lipid profile and liver function in patients after hypothyroidism. Sixty patients who underwent a surgical operation to remove thyroid were included in this study, and thirty healthy subjects were used as a control. The study was conducted at Al-Sadr Medical City in Al-Najaf city, in Iraq, from October 2020 to March 2021. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was very high in patients at a hypothyroid stage after hypothyroidism. The results showed a significant increase in total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and the ratio of total cholesterol\/high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The study also revealed a significant increase in the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) and a significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients with thyroidectomy compared to the control group. The correlation matrix revealed a strong positive correlation between TSH levels and total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, AST, ALT, and ALP. It was concluded that hypothyroidism, the major consequence of thyroidectomy, causes dysfunction in lipid metabolism and liver enzymes resulting in secondary hyperlipidemia and liver dysfunction.","53":"Balance dysfunction in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a high-risk fall precaution, along with sarcopenia and senile asthenia, which leads to traumas, including fractures of the proximal humerus fractures (PHF). The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a functional training as part of a physical therapy program on balance, upper limb (UL) function, daily living activities, and quality of life in elderly patients with PD and frailty, following proximal humerus fractures. We examined 33 elderly patients with PD and frailty in the recovery period after PHF. The control group included individuals who underwent rehabilitation according to the general principles of kinesitherapy. The treatment group consisted of patients engaged in a program of physical therapy directed at improving balance, function of the upper UL, motor stereotype, and activities of daily living. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure (DASH), Wrist Dynamometry, Falls efficacy Scale International (FES-I), Barthel Activities of daily living (ADL) Index, Lawton Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) Scale, PD Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). According to all studied indicators, the patients of both groups showed a statistically and significantly better result compared to the initial data (p&lt;0.05), but the treatment group showed better outcomes compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05).","54":null,"55":"Detection of liver dysfunction in patients with diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) at an early stage allows for correcting it in time with appropriate therapy; therefore, diagnosing hepatobiliary system lesions in these patients is an important medical issue. We examined 62 patients, divided into two groups depending on the duration of the disease. The first group included patients with a disease duration of up to two years, the second group - patients with a disease duration of more than two years. The study and comparison of laboratory and multiparametric ultrasound criteria of liver and thyroid dysfunction were performed. Analysis of ultrasound signs of hepatobiliary system lesions in patients in the two groups showed that they were more common in the second group. There is a correlation between the stiffness of the parenchyma of the thyroid gland and liver and the duration of the disease, the level of free thyroxine (T4f), and antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors (ArTTG). Increased liver stiffness was more common in patients with ArTTG levels above 20 IU\/ml, and the degree of F1 fibrosis was higher at T4f greater than 50 pmol\/l. To assess the condition of a patient with DTG and the need to correct treatment tactics, it is advisable to use the criteria of multiparametric ultrasound examination of the hepatobiliary system and thyroid gland.","56":"Renal transplant patients show a high prevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after the procedure. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and factors associated with the incidence of CMV infection among renal transplant patients. A total of 100 patients were recruited in this study. The CMV load in the blood of each patient was assessed using the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The serostatus of all recipients and donors was examined preoperatively and those of the recipients again postoperatively. The association of CMV load was assessed with the following factors: age, gender, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum creatinine levels, types of immunosuppressive and induction regimens, preoperative diabetes status, and serological virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks postoperatively. Our findings showed that CMV incidence was significantly higher in middle-aged patients (62 of 66 patients, 93.9%; p=0.0001). Furthermore, about 88.2% of patients induced by anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) showed a high viral load, significantly higher than the proportion of CMV-positive patients induced by basiliximab (p=0.001). In addition, a higher proportion of CMV-negative recipients who received the graft from CMV-positive donors and vice-versa were CMV-positive postoperatively. Administration of Valcyte 450 showed 100% efficiency in decreasing the CMV load in the patients. Among all the assessed factors, only the age of the recipients, type of induction therapy used, and the preoperative serostatus of both donors and recipients were significantly associated with the postoperative CMV incidence among the patients.","57":"This study investigates the response of bone marrow (particularly megakaryocytes) in mice under the influence of diclofenac sodium for 10 days using intraperitoneal injection at various doses. A fundamentally new immunomagnetic separation method was applied during the experiment, which helped obtain pure lines of bone marrow cells, particularly megakaryocytes (MC), without admixtures of other cells or their particles. The resulting cells completely retain their structure and can be used in further research. The study determined that different doses of diclofenac sodium have different effects on different groups of diabetes mellitus cells CD34-megakaryocytes. The use of 1.0 mg\/ml sharply negatively affects the state of early populations of megakaryocytes (decrease by 80%, p=0.05), a dose of 0.025 mg\/ml had the least effect on this population of cells (22.8%, p=0.05). The greatest number of average forms of diabetes mellitus 34 was observed when using a dose of 0.95 mg\/ml (22.8%, p=0.05), with a gradual decrease in the dose, the indicator of this group of cells decreased. A dose of 0.03 mg\/ml did not affect the quantitative state of megakaryocytes, and a dose of 0.025 mg\/ml caused a slight decrease (16.6%, p=0.05). Indicators of mature cells of megakaryocytes CD 34- decreased in all studied groups, however, their maximum value reached a maximum decrease by 0.25 mg\/ml (55.2%, p=0.05), the dose of diclofenac sodium 0.03 mg\/ml, lower (18.4%, p=0.05). Diclofenac sodium in different doses has different effects on the degree of differentiation of CD 34-. Its introduction positively affects the state of intermediate forms of megakaryocytes, except for minimal doses, while the effect on early and mature forms in all cases turned out to be negative.","58":null,"59":"Almost all of the deaths happening under the age of 5 occur in the developed countries of Africa and Asia. This study included children admitted to the surgical care, aged 6 months to 5 years, who suffered from acute gastroenteritis and received treatment at Samawah, Iraq, from December 2018 to December 2019. Test results detected different types of rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses using ELISA. 56.6% of the infections were attributed to a viral pathogen. The main cause was attributed to rotavirus and adenovirus. The causative agents of diarrheal diseases in 28.1% of cases are rotaviruses, in 17.05% - adenoviruses, in 11.43% - astroviruses. Viral mono-infections are detected more often than mixed infections. Viral intestinal infections are characterized by seasonality and rise in the cold season, with a peak incidence of rotavirus infection in April, adenovirus infection in November, and astrovirus infection in December.","60":"This study aimed to reveal and investigate mothers' experiences of students with severe disabilities regarding learning in distance education in Lima-Peru. This is a phenomenological study focused on understanding the world of mothers regarding the education of their children with severe disabilities. Their discourse focused on four categories: being the mother of a child with severe disability, pandemic category, virtual education, and family prospects. The participants were three mothers of children with Down Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Cerebral Palsy. An in-depth interview structured in 26 questions was used, applied face to face. With distance education, the mothers consider that their children's abilities and skills have assumed a leading role, developed creativity, and employed various strategies to comply with school activities. In addition, it also strengthened their family ties despite the pandemic.","61":"A dedicated network-based trauma system ensures optimal care to injured patients. Considering the significant burden of trauma, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is striving to develop a nationwide trauma system. This article describes the recent design, development, and implementation of the Saudi Arabian trauma system in line with Vision 2030. The basis of our strategy was the find, organize, clarify, understand, select-plan, do, check, and act (FOCUS-PDCA) model, developed by engaging key stakeholders, including patients. More than 300 healthcare professionals and patients from around the Riyadh region assessed the current system with three solutions and roadmap workshops. Subsequently, the national clinical advisory group (CAG) for trauma was formed to develop the Saudi Arabian trauma system, and CAG members analyzed and collated internationally recognized trauma systems and guidelines. The guidelines' applicability in the kingdom was discussed and reviewed, and an interactive document was developed to support socialization and implementation. The CAG team members agreed on the guiding principles for the trauma pathway, identified the challenges, and finalized the new system design. They also developed a trauma care standard document to support and guide the rollout of new trauma networks across the kingdom. The CAG members and other stakeholders are at the forefront of implementing the trauma system across the Riyadh region. Recent trauma system development in Saudi Arabia is the first step in improving national trauma care and may guide development in other locations, regionally and internationally, to improve outcomes.","62":"Sexual behavior is influenced by social and communication deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is a serious challenge for parents who lack effective strategies for providing sexual education to their children with ASD. The purpose of this study was to explore Iranian parents' experiences of psychological distress in dealing with the sexual behaviors of their children with ASD. This qualitative study was designed following the conventional content analysis approach. Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 parents of children with ASD aged 8-34 years. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were collected through purposeful sampling and continued until data saturation. The worries theme was extracted from data interpretation using qualitative content analysis, and this theme entailed four subthemes: 1) sexual vulnerability, 2) unintended social consequences, 3) psychological suffering, and 4) confusion about the future of a child's sex life. This study emphasized the importance of paying attention to parents' concerns about the sexual behaviors of children with ASD. Parents' psychological distress is a major obstacle to proper coping with sexual behaviors, and using coping strategies may help reduce psychological distress in parents of children with ASD. Therefore, it is necessary to design, implement, and evaluate culture-appropriate educational programs to address parents' concerns regarding the sexual health of a child with autism.","63":"At present, it is relevant to preserve and raise healthy, well-developed newborn animals adapted to new conditions, which form the basis for increasing the yield of animal husbandry. Gastrointestinal diseases cause the main losses of young animals. Acute gastrointestinal diseases of calves, lambs, piglets, and chickens are widespread in Kazakhstan. The study aims to develop a competitive treatment and prophylactic drug composition based on probiotic bacterial strains. Modern certified and standardized biochemical, microbiological, molecular biological studies were considered during the research. The morphological, cultural, and biochemical properties of the cultures were studied according to generally accepted schemes. Standard methods of finding averages and their mean errors were used for the mathematical processing of results. Antibiotics, sulfonamide, and nitrofuran drugs are the most common methods to combat diseases in young animals. However, the use of antibacterial agents often leads to the death of normal microflora, disrupting the microbiocenosis of the gastrointestinal tract, the appearance of microorganisms with resistance to drugs, and a decrease in product quality. In this regard, the direction of biotechnology involved in the development and creation of environmentally friendly microbial preparations with prophylactic effectiveness is very relevant. Data on the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the probiotic strain of Escherichia coli 39-SN are presented.","64":"Though hydatid disease affects many organs in the human body, splenic hydatid accounts for approximately 0.8-4% of all human echinococcosis cases. Up to recently, splenectomy was the preferred surgery for hydatid spleen. Since 1980, conservative options to treat such a disease have become more and more prevalent. Our study aimed to assess our experience in open splenic preservative surgery for splenic hydatid in a single institutional center. Our retrospective research included ten patients with splenic hydatid operated between August 2013 and January 2018 at our medical center. The spleen was affected alone in seven cases, the liver and spleen were affected in three cases, and one of the patients had intra-peritoneal cyst disease. The diagnosis was confirmed primarily by ultrasonography. In some instances, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were required. A chest x-ray was performed to rule out pulmonary hydatid in all patients. Open surgery procedure, field isolation, cystic fluid aspiration, and injection of 1% cetrimide solution, respiration, endocystectomy, suture of cystic edges to the intracystic tube drain were performed. All surgeries had albendazole before and after the operation 15 mg\/kg\/day. There were no significant intra or postoperative complications, and no further surgery was required. Patients remained hospitalized for 3-5 days. No recurrence after 1-3 follow-up years. However, three patients failed to follow up within two years. Our experience with splenic hydatids prompts us to use splenic conservation surgery whenever possible instead of splenectomy.","65":"Indonesia is currently experiencing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting maternal health services and maternal mortality. This research aims to investigate the use of antenatal care (ANC) during the COVID-19 second wave and the factors that play a role in this situation. A cross-sectional study was conducted during July 2021 on 344 pregnant women in primary, secondary, and tertiary maternal health care facilities in Pasuruan Regency, Indonesia. The data collection technique was simple random sampling, with face-to-face interviews assisted by questionnaires. Logistic regression and adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI and p&lt;0.05 were performed to identify a significant relationship. 136 (39.5%) pregnant women did not use ANC services during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Husband's support (AOR=13.814, 95% CI: 8.090-23.588), believing that pregnant women are not afraid of contracting COVID-19 (AOR=6.501, 95% CI: 3.904-10.825), easy access to transportation (AOR=12.145, 95% CI: 6.186-23.846), ease of ANC fees (AOR=4.105, 95% CI: 2.424-6.950), no lockdown policy (AOR=3.130, 95% CI: 1.983-4.940), knowledge regarding COVID-19 (AOR=2.975, 95% CI: 1.793-4.938), COVID-19 information on social media (AOR=3.035, 95% CI: 1.179-7.815), COVID-19 prevention protocols in health facilities (AOR=8.478, 95% CI: 3.611-19.903) were predictors of ANC utilization. This encourages the importance of prioritizing health services for pregnant women during the pandemic, overcoming the fear of contracting COVID-19 through maternal education, husband support, easy access to ANC, and improving the quality of ANC service facilities.","66":null,"67":"","68":"[This corrects the article on p. 274 in vol. 11, PMID: 30894882.].","69":"[This corrects the article on p. 111 in vol. 14, PMID: 33767795.].","70":"Spina bifida is a disorder characterized by failure of the neural tube to form during embryological development.

Here we introduce a 27-year-old man with no history of cardiovascular disease, with a history of hospitalization due to acute pericarditis in the previous month, who was discharged with a good response to ibuprofen treatment but had clinical and electrocardiographically recurrence of pericarditis with compressive retrosternal chest pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes in favor of acute infero-postero-right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction (MI). Treatment with vasodilator improved compressive retrosternal chest pain and reversed acute myocardial infarction changes completely and left pleuritic chest pain and pericarditis changes in the ECG. Due to the typical chest pain, he was admitted to the emergency room; ECG revealed generalized ST-segment elevation with acute pericarditis pattern again. Acute infero-posterior and right ventricular acute myocardial infarction pattern was also evident. After treatment with nitroglycerin in the Critical Cardiac Unit (CCU), all ECG ischemic changes returned to baseline, and pericarditis remained in all leads. The patient was discharged with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), calcium channel blockers, and a good general condition.","73":"This study describes the experience of radical mastectomies with simultaneous breast reconstruction using TRAM flap in patients with inflammatory breast cancer. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of primary breast reconstruction using the TRAM-flap procedure in patients with an inflammatory form of breast cancer. Our work is associated with some deviation from generally accepted standards: delayed breast reconstruction after radical mastectomy for inflammatory breast cancer. We describe the experience of radical mastectomies with the simultaneous reconstruction of the breast using a TRAM flap in patients with inflammatory breast cancer. This study included 12 patients diagnosed with breast cancer stages IIIB and IIIC. Almost all patients (eleven out of twelve patients) underwent radical mastectomy with one-stage reconstruction using a TRAM flap after chemotherapy. Two years later, one patient (8.3%) showed disease progression in the form of distant metastases in the bones of the spine. One patient (8.3%) had a regional relapse in the displaced flap near the postoperative scar. The rest of the patients (83.4%) showed no signs of continuing the disease. Patients with one-stage breast reconstruction improved socially, and their subjective well-being was better than those who underwent radical mastectomy without reconstruction. Experience in performing one-stage reconstructions in the surgical treatment of patients with inflammatory breast cancer is a reason for restrained optimism regarding the possibility and feasibility of these operations.","74":"Deafness is a total or partial hearing loss that may appear at any age and with different degrees of severity. Approximately 50% of hearing loss have a genetic origin, and among them, non-syndromic sensorineural deafness represents about 70% of the cases. From them, 80% correspond to autosomal recessive inheritance deafness. Autosomal recessive deafness was not studied enough at the molecular level in Iraq. This study aimed to verify the frequency of three GJB2 mutations in non-syndromic sensorineural deafness in the Iraqi population. The current case-control study was conducted from January 2018 to January 2020. The study included 95 deafness patients (55 males and 40 females) and 110 healthy control group. Age and sex were matched between the two groups. In order to detect c.35delG, 235delC, and 167delT mutations in the GJB2 gene, we employed the PCR-RFLP technique. The c.35delG was the main frequent mutation encountered with the GJB2 gene among patients with autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Among them, 35 (36.8%) were homozygous, 40 (42.1%) were heterozygous, and 20 (21.1%) were wild genotypes. The second-degree mutation in the GJB2 gene was c.235delC mutation, which from the 95 deaf patients, there were 20 (21.1%) with homozygous, 33 (34.7%) heterozygous, and 42 (44.2%) wild genotypes. None of the 95 deaf patients showed the c.167delT mutation, and no mutations appeared in the control group. Our data concluded that the GJB2 c.35delG and c.235delC gene mutations were the main cause of autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss in the Iraqi deaf population.","75":"Investigation of the mechanisms promoting the development of menstrual function disorders associated with obesity in adolescent girls is one of the most important issues of modern medicine. This study included 110 patients. 79 patients aged 12-18 with menstrual disorders associated with obesity were divided into two groups: group 1: 46 patients with apparent signs of hyperandrogenism, group 2: 33 patients without clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism. The control group included 31 girls of the same age with a regular menstrual cycle. The complex of hormone examination of adolescent girls included determination of serum content: gonadotropic hormones (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin (PRL), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), progesterone (PR), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate; insulin (In) - radioisotope method on a gamma counter \"Narcotest\" (reagents \"IMMUNOTECH\", Czech Republic).

The research methodology comprises Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) statistical analysis of staff and bed security indicators. The reason for choosing Belgium and Norway for comparative analysis regarding the readiness to face the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of staff and bed security is because Belgium is leading by the highest level and Norway is leading by the lowest level of morbidity and mortality per 1 million population. The study revealed that the greatest enabler of the primary health care system efficiency in terms of resistance to COVID-19 is primary health care staff security. The analysis clearly shows that the number of beds is not paramount for the effectiveness of the healthcare system and primary health care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the deficiencies and weaknesses of primary health care systems of all countries of the world. The research results suggest that Belgium and other countries focus on the education of nurses and therapists. The significance of the research results is that they prove that the main factor of the effectiveness of the primary health care system is its human resources. This information is useful for improving health systems in many countries around the world.","78":"We studied the morphologic and histochemical organization of neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus in rats exposed to different durations of photoperiod and injection of melatonin. Morphometric and histochemical analyses of neurons were performed after staining brain histological sections for RNA.

Our analysis follows three steps: using the sensitivities and specificities of the used antigen tests, we first calculated the number of test-positive individuals and the proportion of actual positives in those who participated in the antigen tests. We then calculated the dark figure in the total population of Slovakia and South Tyrol, respectively. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the dark figure in the vulnerable population to the number of newly detected infections through PCR tests. Per one positive PCR result, another 0.15 to 0.71 cases must be added in South Tyrol and 0.01 to 1.25 cases in Slovakia.

However, some issues related to their use still occur. Our study aimed to evaluate an important number of procedures, the complications of ureteral stents, and their prevention and treatment retrospectively. We evaluate 50,000 procedures performed between 1996 and 2021 on 36,688 patients. According to the stenting duration, the cases were divided into short-term (less than 6 weeks - 34,213 procedures), respectively long-term stenting (more than 6 weeks - 15,757 procedures). The indications of stenting for both groups were noted. The total number of complications was 41,369. We encountered 153 cases (0.3%) of JJ stent malposition, of which 3 cases were into the retroperitoneum, one case with parenchymal perforation and hematoma. Considering the double J migrations, we found proximal migration in 427 cases (0.9%) and distal double J migrations in 352 (0.7%) cases. The obstruction of the ureteral stent, causing inefficient drainage, was encountered in 925 cases, while irritative bladder symptoms occurred in 16,326 cases (32.7%). Hematuria was observed in 5,213 cases, in 7 cases blood transfusion being necessary. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 7,436 cases (14.8%). Stent encrustation and calcification occurred in 832 cases, while stent fragmentation was noted in 52 cases. Double J stent complications should be promptly evaluated and treated. Encrustation and stone formation in forgotten stents often lead to serious complications and should be managed with stent removal and combined endourological techniques.","85":"Sexual dimorphic studies of various parameters of the femur play an important role in forensic studies. Various femur morphometric parameters help estimate an individual's age, sex, and stature from unknown skeletal remains. This research was done to analyze maximum length, trochanteric oblique length, and diameter of the femur head for sexual dimorphism. The study was done on 200 (128 male &amp; 72 female) Indian adult human femora, which were fully ossified, dry, and free from deformity. The maximum length of the femur (L), trochanteric oblique length (TOL), and vertical diameter of the head (VDH) were measured using an osteometric board and digital Vernier calipers. The mean length of the femur was 436.88 mm in males and 402.38 mm in females, respectively. The mean trochanteric oblique length of the femur was 423.78 mm in males and 387.18 mm in females, respectively. The mean vertical diameter of the femur head was 43 mm in males and 38.19 mm in females, respectively. Depending upon the results of this study, it was concluded that the mean values of maximum length, trochanteric oblique length, and vertical diameter of the femur head are significantly higher in males than females. These parameters are useful and reliable for sexual dimorphism in anthropometric and forensic studies, especially in identifying skeletal remains. These differences can also be considered in selecting or designing the exact ranges of the gender-specific prosthesis for Orthopedic surgeries.","86":"Hartmann's procedure involves resecting the rectosigmoid colon, closure of the distal rectal stump, and forming an end colostomy for complicated left colon diverticulitis or malignancy.

This study aimed to assess the reversal rate and its correlation with demographic data, ASA grade, and length of hospital stay. All patients who underwent Hartmann's emergency procedure from 2014 to 2018 at Lewisham and Greenwich hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. Data was collected from the inpatient electronic files and NELA (UK National Laparotomy Audit). 118 patients were included in the study, with 57.6% females and a median age of patients of 69 years (range 35-91). Findings of the study indicate that the most common indications for Hartmann's procedure were diverticular complications 60% (n=71) and benign perforated sigmoid or rectosigmoid cancer 16% (n=19). The average length of hospital stay was 24 days (range n=2 - 212 days). The reversal rate was 34.9% (41\/118 cases). No significant difference was observed between gender and length of hospital stay in relation to the reversal rate while there was a significant correlation between age and ASA grade in relation to reversal rate; the calculated P values were recorded as (&lt;0.000) and (&lt;0.009) respectively. Our results show that the highest reversal rate was observed in younger and fitter (I-II) ASA grade patients. The most common medical complication from reversal of Hartmann's procedure was an anastomotic leak (n=6, 16.7%). Reversal rate of Hartmann's procedure was 34.9%. The average timeframe for reversal was within 18-20 months. There was a significant correlation between age and ASA grade in relation to reversal rate.","87":"The wide access to varied, attractive, and aggressively promoted information can induce pregnant women to think that any form of complementary therapy can be a saving solution for a medical problem because these therapies are natural, therefore, harmless. Updated information from literature about indications, benefits, limits, and risks of phytotherapy in pregnancy was presented. Valuable therapeutic resources with proven clinical efficacy (evidence-based medicine) were presented for each trimester of pregnancy, during labor, postpartum, but also during breastfeeding. For some phytotherapeutics, there are scientific studies. There is also a detailed presentation about some possibilities for therapeutic errors, which should be avoided during pregnancy. Positive results of phytotherapy deserve to be known and applied by the obstetrician for the certain benefit of future mothers.","88":"The Continuum theory and the Levels of Health theory were separately proposed to explain the myriad responses to treatment and understand the process of health and disease in an individual. In light of accumulating evidence on the intricate relationship between the human immune system and microbiome, an attempt is made in this article to connect these two theories to explain the transmutation of the efficiently responding immune system (through the acute inflammatory response and high fever) to one involved in a low-grade chronic inflammatory process (resulting in chronic disease). There is already enough evidence to demonstrate the role of the microbiome in all chronic inflammatory diseases. In this article, we discuss the mechanism by which subjecting a healthy person to continuous drug treatment for acute inflammatory conditions (at a certain time) leads to transmutation to chronic disease. Although this hypothesis requires further experimental evidence, it calls for a reconsideration of the manner in which we treat acute infectious diseases in the population.","89":"","90":"Hand soft tissue defects after trauma injuries or tumor excision are challenging for the plastic surgeon, regardless of the patient's age, gender, or ethnicity. Current surgical protocols suggest protecting the main arteries by using local or free perforator flaps. This article describes the use of local perforator flaps to resurface soft tissue defects with exposed tendons, nerves, arteries and\/or bones to obtain the best mobility of the flexion creases without sacrificing the main artery. We present the use of the dorsal metacarpal artery perforator (Quaba) flap in two cases, showing different types of pathology that could benefit from this method. The first case is a 43-year-old male patient, known with psoriasis, who suffered a home accident with a chainsaw. The second case is a 35-year-old woman with a round, mobile skin tumor located on the volar surface of the metacarpophalangeal joint. The patients were discharged from the hospital the next day postoperative. Both patients reported a slight bulkiness of the flap without affecting the functional outcome, preserving full mobility of the fingers. The Quaba flap is a distally based perforator axial flap suitable for soft tissue defects reconstructions, safe and easy to use, with minimal donor site morbidity. Slight bulkiness could affect the aesthetics of the hand.","91":"Omphalocele (exomphalos) represents one of the most frequent congenital abdominal wall defects. It presents as a defect of inconstant size and is located on the midline, at the base of the umbilical cord, the skin, fascia, and abdominal muscles being absent at this level. Omphaloceles are classified as liver-containing or non-liver-containing, the latter containing primarily bowel loops. We present the case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman with an early diagnosis of liver-containing omphalocele associating ductus venosus reversed flow, with the aim to highlight the importance of the first-trimester morphology scan and to develop a pilot study regarding the neurological development of infants after surgical repair of giant omphaloceles. The particularity of this case consists of a fetus with a positive diagnosis of a giant liver-containing omphalocele but with a small abdominal wall defect during the first-trimester morphology scan at 13 weeks and 3 days of gestation which associated ductus venosus reversed flow, presenting a normal karyotype postabortum. With a small defect, we can speculate the risk of strangling besides the mechanical traction exercised on the ductus venosus generating fetal distress, specifically fetal hypoxia at an early gestational age. In conclusion, the main issue, in this case, was if the fetal omphalocele and ductus venosus reversed flow indicated fetal hypoxia, what was the obstruction effect on the oxygenated blood pathway caused by the abdominal defect, and which were the long-term effects on infants with this complex pathology with an unknown outcome.","92":"Facial dysostoses are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions characterized by congenital craniofacial anomalies which result from abnormal development of the first two pharyngeal arches and their derivatives during embryogenesis. Mandibulofacial dysostosis Guion-Almeida type (MFDGA) is a rare and relatively new syndrome described in the literature, first identified by Guion-Almeida et al. in 2000 and 2006. Another 108 cases have been documented after that. Prenatal diagnosis of this syndrome has not been described yet. Here we present the prenatal ultrasound findings in a case where MFDGA was confirmed after delivery. We suggest that MFDGA should be included in the prenatal differential diagnosis of syndromes with micrognathia and craniofacial anomalies.","93":"Neural tube defects (NTDs) occur during embryogenesis, specifically during the fifth or sixth week of gestation, and are described as aberrant neural tube closing. The defect may alter the normal development of the vertebrae, spinal cord, cranium, or brain. The present study describes the case of a 41-year-old pregnant woman with fetal sacral meningocele, no associated pathologies, no family history of neural tube defects, a pregnancy under folate supplementation with the aim of highlighting the importance of ultrasound in diagnosing neural tube defects. The ultrasonographic diagnosis was not clear from the beginning. In our case, the differential diagnosis of meningocele was made with the cystic compound of a sacrococcygeal teratoma, which represents one of the most common congenital tumors in newborns. The particularity of this case was that a neural tube defect occurred despite the prophylactic administration of folic acid during pregnancy, which represents a well-documented protection against neural tube defects in fetuses.","94":"Cancer testis antigens have been discovered in various cancers, and several studies have suggested that since they exhibit such distinct patterns of expression, these antigens might be attractive targets for cancer detection and immunotherapy. Our work attempted to clarify the function played by cancer-testis antigens in ovarian cancers, notably in the XAGE1 gene. The investigation was conducted on 74 tissue samples from newly diagnosed patients with ovarian cancer. The control group included twenty-eight benign ovarian tumors. The expression of XAGE1 mRNA was assessed using RT-PCR. Compared to benign tumors, cancer samples exhibited higher levels of XAGE1 gene expression, which was statistically significant (P0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between menopausal status and family history. Gene expression was substantially connected with age groups as the higher level of gene expression in patients 50-74 years of age (P 0.01) was seen. Mucinous tumors exhibited significant correlations (P0.01) across histopathological tumor types. In correlation with tumor stages, stage III was substantially linked compared to stage I (P0.01). In conclusion, we referred to the potential to use XAGE1 to discriminate malignant ovarian tumors as a diagnostic biomarker. The connection of high XAGE 1 level with advanced ovarian cancer stages has also been established, supporting XAGE 1's proposed role in poor prognosis. Finally, finding the specific involvement of this gene in ovarian cancer and other kinds of malignancies may require further investigations.","95":"The main aim of this study is to systematically record Cerebrolysin treatment modalities and concomitant medication, according to local standards, in patients with moderate to severe neurological deficits after acute ischemic stroke and to assess the impact of these parameters on therapy outcome during early rehabilitation (day 21) and on day 90. An open observational treatment design based on the principles of high-quality comparative effectiveness research (HQCER) has been chosen to capture the therapies as applied in real-world clinical practice. HQCER opens a new horizon for strengthening the validity of the results from observational trials, thereby enhancing the associated level of evidence. Rigorous pre-specification of analytical procedures and tight risk-based centralized monitoring were additional measures to improve the impact of the observational approach. The value for real-world studies has become obvious, and such studies based on comparative effectiveness designs supplement the classical study designs by enabling the inclusion of larger proband numbers and more statistical reliability for practical use.","96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":"There are numerous scientific studies of recurrent miscarriage (RM) with possible causes, such as fetal chromosomal abnormalities, infectious agents, adverse environmental factors, bad habits, anatomical defects, thrombophilic disorders, etc. However, RM causes in 50% of cases remain unknown. These RM cases do not have any explainable etiology, and they require in-depth etiopathogenesis study, thus they are considered idiopathic RM. The purpose of this research is to study polymorphisms relationship of the immune response genes CX3CR1 (rs3732379, Val249Ile), CTLA4 (rs3087243, CT60 G\/A), and HLA DQA1, DQB1, DRB1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II) with the idiopathic form of recurrent miscarriage (iRM) development in Kazakh population. Independent replicative TagMan genotyping for 302 patients with iRM and 300 women with normal reproduction was performed. It has been shown that carriage of unfavorable genotypes (Val\/Ile, Val\/Val) by the Val249Ile polymorphism of the CX3CR1 gene increases the risk of developing iRM by 1.43 times. Search for associations of genes allelic variants of HLA class 2 complex with iRM revealed *501 allele in DQA1 locus, *0301 in DQB1 locus, *10, *12, *15, *16 alleles in DRB1 locus, which increases the risk of developing iRM in Kazakh population with OR from 1.34 to 4.5. As a result of the study, obtained highly significant associations of immune response genes with the development of iRM in the Kazakh population indicate the possible involvement of the immune system interaction of mother cells with syncytiotrophoblast, which is realized by vascularization defects, defective embryo implantation, and leads to early pregnancies' termination.","100":null,"101":"Bariatric surgeries such as sleeve gastrectomy; mini-gastric bypass surgery are successful weight reduction surgeries which significantly impact metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of laparoscopy gastrectomy and mini-gastric bypasses on weight decrease and diabetes remission of diabetic mellitus type 2 through two years of monitoring. Furthermore, this study looked at the difference between the two procedures regarding their efficacy and identify which one is proper for patients according to their comorbidities. A prospective study was held in Al Sadder Medical City and Al-Gadeer private hospitals in Al-Najaf city, Iraq, from January 2016 to February 2018. The study included 35 obese and morbidly obese patients with a known history of diabetes mellitus type 2, diagnosed from at least two years before surgery. 15 patients undergo uneventful laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (6 females and 9 males). 20 patients underwent uneventful laparoscopic gastric mini bypass surgery (6 females and 14 males). In addition, the patients were followed in the short-term postoperatively (3, 6, 12, 24 months) by monitoring their BMI, weight loss, and HbA1c. There was a decrease in BMI of about 45% from the baseline BMI in sleeve gastrectomy surgery and a decrease in HbA1c of about 45%, less than 6%. In gastric mini-bypass surgery, there was a decrease in BMI of about 47% from the baseline BMI and a decrease in HbA1c of about 45% from the baseline less than 6%, during a 24-month monitoring. Both surgeries were fruitful and had efficient results on patients, but the gastric mini bypass was more efficient than sleeve gastrectomy in controlling and remission of DM type 2 without the need for medications. A long-term study should be performed to reveal their effect and benefits to the patients.","102":null,"103":null,"104":"This study presents (1) a case of an injury to an unbelted passenger and (2) the possibilities of proving the occurrence of injuries to traffic accident participants. We demonstrate the case of an injury to a passenger who failed to fasten her seat belt, and question whether her injuries would have been equally serious if she had fastened her seat belt. Theoretical bases and methods for the interdisciplinary procedure of medical examiners using the PC Fortis program and technical analysts of traffic accidents using the PC Crash program are presented. Furthermore, individual practical steps are documented, the result showing that the injuries to the passenger would have occurred, but, to a minimum extent, i.e., 6.9% of the original injuries, which would have not exceeded the legal limit for damage to health.","105":null,"106":"Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As the number of stroke cases is rising from one year to another, policymakers require data on the amount spent on stroke to enforce better financing policies for prevention, hospital care, outpatient rehabilitation services and social services. We aimed to systematically assess the economic burden of stroke at global level. Cost of stroke studies were retrieved from five databases. We retrieved the average cost per patient, where specified, or estimated it using a top-down approach. Resulting costs were grouped in two main categories: per patient per year and per patient lifetime. We extracted information from forty-six cost of illness studies. Per patient per year costs are larger in high income countries and in studies conducted from the payer perspective. The highest average per patient per year cost by country was reported in the United States ($59,900), followed by Sweden ($52,725) and Spain ($41,950). The highest per patient lifetime costs were reported in Australia ($232,100) for all identified definitions of stroke. Existing literature regarding the economic burden of stroke is concentrated in high-income settings, with very few studies conducted in South America and Africa. Published manuscripts on this topic highlight substantial methodological heterogeneity, rendering comparisons difficult or impossible, even within the same country or among studies with similar costing perspectives.","107":"Leptin is a hormone derived from adipose tissue and the small intestine, mainly in enterocytes; it helps regulate the energy balance by suppressing hunger, resulting in decreased fat mass in adipocytes. Leptin has specific receptors in the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei and other parts of the hypothalamus and the feeding center in the ventral tegmental area. It also plays a role in regulatory aspects other than fat cells, such as obesity, which is linked to a loss of sensitivity of leptin receptors, resulting in an inability to produce satiety and an increase in food intake. Moreover, leptin plays a part in lactation, bone density, the immune system, diabetes treatments, and hypertriglyceridemia. The latest studies in leptin suggest that an analog of leptin may treat DM and hypertriglyceridemia. Further research should be conducted on the effectiveness of leptin on other related diseases.","108":"Nowadays, chronic alcoholism and its health implications represent a global concern. Over three million deaths are linked to chronic alcohol intake every year. This article aims to spread awareness about the negative impact ethanol can have on almost every organ in the body, especially the liver. Understanding ethanol metabolism and the cellular pathways through which alcohol increases liver oxidative stress may prevent a broad spectrum of hepatic lesions such as steatosis, steatohepatitis, and, ultimately, cirrhosis. After a short review of ethanol metabolism and liver oxidative stress, each hepatic lesion will be individually discussed regarding the mechanism of apparition, treatment, and future targeted therapies.","109":"","110":"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a rare clinical entity caused in most cases by a cerebrospinal fluid leak occurring at the level of the spinal cord. Cranial dural leaks have been previously reported as a cause of orthostatic headaches but, as opposed to spinal dural leaks, were not associated with other findings characteristic of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. We present the case of a male admitted for severe orthostatic headache. The patient had a history of intermittent postural headaches, dizziness, and symptoms consistent with post-nasal drip, which appeared several years after head trauma. Brain imaging showed signs consistent with intracranial hypotension: bilateral hygromas, subarachnoid hemorrhage, superficial siderosis, diffuse contrast enhancement of the pachymeninges, and superior sagittal sinus engorgement. No spinal leak could be identified by magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient had a rapid remission of symptoms with conservative management. Further work-up identified an old temporal bone fracture which created a route of egress between the posterior fossa and the mastoid cells. Otorhinolaryngology examination showed pulsatile bloody discharge and liquorrhea at the level of the left pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The orthostatic character of the headache, as well as the brain imaging findings, were consistent with intracranial hypotension syndrome caused by a cranial dural leak. Clinical signs and imaging findings consistent with the diagnosis of apparently \"spontaneous\" intracranial hypotension should prompt the search for a cranial dural leak if a spinal leak is not identified.","111":"The quality of working relationships among medical team members is influenced by communication, which has a significant impact on patient safety. Our study took place at the Dr. Nicolae Robanescu National Neurorehabilitation Center for Children, Bucharest, between October and December 2019 and included 44 participants that were grouped into three categories: physicians, physical therapists, and nurses (32 women and 12 men), aged between 23 and 53, all of whom were employed in the same unit. A total of 5 questions were used to select data on communication difficulties. The chi-square test used for statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between the professional categories participating in the research (p&gt;0.05). We suggest increasing the group size in a future study to increase the statistical significance.","112":null,"113":"The quality of the data coded based on the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) can be improved by providing continuous education and promoting the clinical coders' knowledge and skills. Due to the significance of maternal health in promoting the health of society, the present study evaluated the effects of an in-service training workshop on ICD-10 coding instructions of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium for clinical coders. This applied evaluation study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a coding instructions training course focusing on the 15th chapter of the ICD-10. The statistical population comprised 45 clinical coders working in the hospitals. The data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire scored on a five-point Likert scale at the reaction level and by pretest and posttest questionnaires at the learning level. The data were then analyzed by descriptive statistics at the reaction level and by a paired-samples t-test at the learning level. The participants' satisfaction with the training course was 94.7% on average at the reaction level. At the learning level, the results of the paired-samples t-test showed a significant difference between the means of scores before and after the training course (p=0.000). The training course led to satisfaction and enhanced the capabilities of the clinical coders with regard to coding the 15th chapter of ICD-10. Clinical Coders must receive training on the new changes and guidelines in the other chapters of ICD-10 based on its most recent revision and employ them in the workplace.","114":null,"115":null,"116":"Innate immunity plays a central role in the pathogenesis of severe asthma, and it is closely linked to elevated IgE and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) levels. However, there is a scarcity of information about the association of the TLR-4 receptor polymorphism in the pathogenesis of severe asthma. This study highlights the level of gene expression of different alleles in asthmatic patients compared to healthy control individuals. This was a randomized control trial, which included 150 patients with asthma (with high serum levels of IgE) with a matching 150 healthy control individuals. Participants had a series of blood tests to measure various immune parameters: interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and detect allele type and gene expression of the TLR-4 gene. Patients with asthma had significantly higher levels of IL-8 when compared to the healthy control participants. In addition, in the rs91 genotyping, there were significant differences in the levels of IL-8 and TNF between CC and TT genotyping. While in rs90 TLR-4, TNF levels were significantly higher in AA vs. AG and GG genotypes among the asthmatic patients when compared to the control group. The results showed that in TLR-4, rs4986791 were significantly associated with asthma risk. Polymorphisms in TLRs play essential roles in asthma.","117":"This study aimed to investigate the patient satisfaction level in terms of communication and interaction with the physicians from a Romanian Infectious Disease hospital. The objectives of the study were related to the identification of the general level of satisfaction of the patients, the evaluation of the physicians' interaction type with their physicians, by using specific behavioral variables, such as respect and attention, as well as to determine the physician-patient communication quality. The data were collected with a self-administered questionnaire and were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25. The sample comprised 82 patients who were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases. The quantitative variables were evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk test and were described by the means and standard deviations, while the qualitative data were described by using the absolute values and percentages. The vast majority of patients were aged between 18-28 years old, were mostly females from urban areas, and 41.5% had university degrees. The outcomes of the study revealed that the general satisfaction of the patients, from a communication perspective, was reflected in the perceived and provided quality of information about the treatment. Although the vast majority of patients highly appreciated the interaction and the communication with their physicians, some individuals felt the need to read more information about their disease, especially from online sources, and they would have preferred their physicians to recommend trustful websites or health care platforms.","118":null,"119":"Hemodialysis is a necessary treatment for end-stage kidney disease patients. It imposes undergoing three sessions of dialysis per week in a specialized center. Amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, precautionary measures were mandatory in all dialysis facilities and may have negatively impacted patients' well-being. This study aimed to uncover the scale of this effect. We performed a cross-sectional study of all patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in two dialysis units (one urban and another rural). Patients with Alzheimer's disease were excluded. Patients filled a questionnaire including information on socio-demographics, factors related to the dialysis facility, and the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on their mental health. A total of 72 patients responded. Their median age was 70 (60.79) years. Of them, 68% were males, 71% were married, and 10% were living alone. Following the pandemic, 35% felt more anxious, with a higher incidence of anxiety in the rural unit (p=0.021). Half of them felt very limited in their relationships, and 29% were isolated from their families. In total, 98% of patients were satisfied with the staff support. The imposed preventive measures were perceived as very strict in 27% of the surveyed patients. The majority of the urban group were bothered for not eating during the session, and they felt significantly more stress than the rural group (p=0.001). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic increased anxiety among hemodialysis patients from a rural setting. Stress was more prevalent in the urban group and most probably related to limitations in eating during sessions. The majority were satisfied with staff support.","120":"This study aimed to examine the pregnancy outcomes in women infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with and without underlying diseases in western Iran. This case-control study compared 49 pregnant women with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with underlying diseases (the case group) and 49 women with COVID-19 without underlying diseases (the control group). The groups were pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to Hamadan hospitals for delivery. COVID-19 was diagnosed by using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). Data were evaluated using a checklist. Further, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16 was used for data analysis. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The odds of preterm labor were five times higher in women with underlying diseases (OR=5.95, 95% CI (3.01, 7.15), p=0.034). Moreover, the odds of preeclampsia and eclampsia in women with underlying diseases was (OR=3.35, 95% CI (1.18, 4.93), p=0.048) and (OR=2.65, 95% CI (1.43, 3.54), p=0.035), respectively. The results revealed that preterm labor, preeclampsia, and eclampsia were significantly higher in women with COVID-19 and underlying diseases compared to those without underlying diseases. Thus, the need to identify and educate pregnant mothers on underlying diseases and attention to prenatal care, particularly in high-risk groups, is necessary for the COVID-19 pandemic.","121":"Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality. Various methods can be used to evaluate the postpartum uterine cavity volume. This work aims to introduce a simple method for uterine postpartum cavity volume evaluation, called Postpartum Uterine Ultrasonographic Scale (PUUS), which could be used routinely. In this prospective study, 131 consecutive Caucasian patients were evaluated by using the PUUS method. The mean age was 27.72 years (ranging from 15 to 42). Patients were examined in the same time intervals: within the first 24-48 hours after delivery in case of vaginal delivery, and within the first 48-72 hours, in case of cesarean delivery. Patients with PUUS grades 2, 3, or 4 were reexamined daily until the PUUS grade declined to 1 or 0. The PUUS method evaluated the length of the endometrium of the uterine cavity occupied by blood or debris, from grade 0 (no blood) to grade 4 (over three-quarters of the endometrial length occupied by blood\/debris). The PUUS grade of uterine involution varied with the day of examination, gestation, and parity. In this article, a novel method of evaluating uterine postpartum involution titled PUUS is introduced. This method standardized uterine cavity involution in a numerical fashion. We hope that the PUUS scale could further be used to decrease the morbidity and mortality of women due to postpartum hemorrhage.","122":"Increasing requirements of medical aid given to children with infectious-inflammatory diseases of the urinary system stipulate the necessity to improve its quality using evidence-based therapeutic-diagnostic and organization technologies. The aim of the work - to substantiate, develop the improved model of the specialized nephrology care for children with infectious inflammatory diseases of the urinary system at the regional level. The official statistical data have been studied (2006 to 2017); information-analytical and statistical methods have been used. A bacteriological study (2009-2016) of urine samples was carried out for 3089 children (0-17 years old) in the Chernivtsi region. They formed the foundation for substantiation and development of an improved functional-organizational model of the system. In addition to the existing and functionally changed elements contains new elements: regional\/inter-regional center of specialized medical aid to children with infectious-inflammatory diseases of the urinary system. Implementation of the elements of the suggested improved model in a part of a rational approach in distribution of functions concerning medical observation of patients at the stages of giving medical aid enabled to make the period of hospitalization of nephrological patients 11,40% shorter and an average period of treatment of patients with infectious-inflammatory diseases of the urinary system 2,93% shorter.","123":"In this study, we aimed to find a correlation between anxiety related to dental procedures and migraines. A cross-sectional study was performed on 171 patients who attended specific dental clinics. The patients were randomly categorized into a migraine group (83) and a control group. To determine the anxiety level, all the patients filled out a validated questionnaire (the Arabic version of the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale). All responses ranged from \"not anxious\" (scoring 1) to \"extremely anxious\" (scoring 5). Based on the patient responses, the total score was recorded and compared statistically between the two groups. The sound of drilling was one of the most vital factors causing anxiety and headaches in migraine patients. Comparing the presence or absence of headache and usage of analgesics between the two groups, migraine patients complained to have headaches during or after dental treatment more frequently than controls and used analgesics more than non-migraine controls. Migraine patients visiting dental clinics feel more anxious about the working environment and need certain modifications before, during, and after dental procedures.","124":"Recent data suggest that the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection in Romania has been declining in the last 30 years. However, there are no studies regarding HP prevalence among medical students. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of HP infection and assess the prevalence of dyspepsia in medical students and the relationship between dyspepsia and infection. We included 150 students from the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Cluj-Napoca, Romania (102 females and 48 males, mean age 21 years). Each student completed a lifestyle questionnaire, personal history, family history as well as the Rome IV questionnaire for functional dyspepsia. The status of HP infection was determined using the C13-urea respiratory test. The prevalence of HP infection was 25.33%, and 18% met the Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia. 37% of students with functional dyspepsia had a positive HP test. Of all students, 8% had a history of HP infection. Those with a history of HP infection had a 4.45% (95% CI 1.6 - 12.37) higher risk of having positive Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia than those with no previous history of infection (p=0.008). Thus, the present study adds to the body of evidence regarding HP prevalence among medical students, 25.33% being positive. We found no statistically significant correlation between HP infection and functional dyspepsia. Those with a history of HP infection had a higher risk of functional dyspepsia.","125":"The purpose of the study was TO analyze the fetoplacental complex hormone levels and changes in their dynamics in pregnant women with miscarriage and the impact of these features on the subsequent course of pregnancy. Hormone levels were determined at different stages of gestation in 50 healthy women with a physiological course of pregnancy (control group) and 50 pregnant women with a history of miscarriage (main group). The women of the main group had a significantly slower rate of increase in hormones and a lag in quantitative indicators than the control group. The estradiol level indicators were 4.1 times (76.0%) and 2.89 times (65.5%) lower in women with miscarriage in the embryonic and late fetal period, respectively, compared to healthy women. Indicators of the level of placental lactogen and chorionic gonadotropin in the embryonic period in women with miscarriage were lower by 39.1% and 50.9%, respectively, compared to healthy women. In the late fetal period, the level of these hormones was lower by 72.9% and 35.4%, respectively. In the embryonic and late fetal periods, progesterone levels were lower by 67.4% and 68.4%, respectively, compared to the control group. The data obtained are evidence of a pronounced hormonal abnormality of the placenta, and hence a marker of fetoplacental dysfunction, which on the background of miscarriage develops at the early stages and continues to progress with the course of pregnancy.","126":"Large meta-analyses demonstrated that ureteral access sheaths (UAS) have specific complications during and after flexible ureteroscopy (fURS). The present study focused on the technical aspects, advantages, drawbacks, and limitations of the latest \"no-touch\" technique (NTT) in the flexible ureteroscopic therapeutic approach of renal stones. A total of 288 patients with a single pyelocaliceal stone (largest diameter between 11 and 29 mm) underwent fURS: 144 using the 12\/14 Fr UAS (group 1) and 144 without UAS (group 2). For NTT, we used four types of ureteroscopes: Olympus URF-V2 (8.5 Fr) - 33 cases, Storz Flex X2 (8.4 Fr) - 60 cases, single-use PUSEN PU 3022 (9.5 Fr) - 37 cases, and single-use PUSEN - PU 3033A (7.5 Fr) - 14 cases. For group 1, we used the Olympus URF-V2 ureteroscope in 44 cases, the Storz Flex X2 in 58 cases, and the single-use PUSEN PU 3022 in 42 cases. We compared the operative time, hospitalization periods, and complications. Successful access sheath insertion was noted in 83.3% of cases from group 1, and successful ureteroscope insertion was noted in 90.9% of cases from group 2. The average operative time was slightly higher in group 1 vs. group 2 (47 vs. 39 min). Stone-free rates (SFRs) were overall lower in group 2 (76.3% vs. 86.8%) at 1 month. At 3 months, we did not find a significant difference between these two groups. Superficial mucosal ureteral wall lesions were found in 38.8% of patients from group 1 and 4.1% from group 2. Hospitalization periods were longer in group 1 vs. group 2 (21 vs. 29 hours, respectively). The single-use 7.5 Fr ureteroscope should receive a special mention: the insertion was simple, we did not encounter any mucosal ureteral wall lesions, and all patients were discharged on the same day. Despite the clear advantages of routine UAS usage, there are many adverse events for the patient. Larger diameter sheaths involve a greater risk of ureteral wall injury. NTT seems to improve peri- and postoperative safety while preserving therapeutic efficiency. The new 7.5 Fr ureteroscopes appear to optimize surgical efficiency and diminish complications in the flexible ureteroscopic treatment of renal stones.","127":"The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought unprecedented changes in the way conventional health care is delivered. This study examined if clinicians' perceptions regarding telemedicine and its barriers to implementation in Malaysia have changed during this pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Malaysian medical doctors of various specialties in four urban healthcare facilities between June 2020 and July 2020. A total of 146 (41.7%) out of 350 responses were obtained. 62% of doctors reported a reduction greater than 50% in outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of doctors either found telemedicine useful in situations similar to COVID-19 (34.2%) or that it is essential to their daily practice (42.5%). However, only 22% reported using telemedicine for consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. 74% of doctors felt that telemedicine would only benefit up to 30% of their patient population. Significantly more female doctors (80%) felt that telemedicine would benefit their patients compared to male doctors (45.8%) (P=0.03). Physicians (51.3%) were more inclined to adopt telemedicine in comparison to surgeons (32.4%) (P=0.03). The majority cited medico-legal issues and consent (80.6%), billing and charges (66.7%) and insurance reimbursement (62.5%), technical difficulties (62.5%) as their barrier to the adoption of telemedicine. Female doctors and physicians were more willing to adopt telemedicine when compared to male doctors and surgeons. Although the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to improve the perception, significant barriers should be resolved before many can incorporate it into their practice.","128":"After almost 50 years of data analysis, screening for colorectal cancer has proven to be an effective tool in reducing colorectal cancer mortality. However, implementing the optimal strategy represents a challenge for many healthcare facilities around the world. There is much discussion regarding how screening should be done, the optimal tools that should be used, and the proper timing for screening procedures. Another essential step is to maintain the adherence of patients to screening programs. Also, the recommendation for lowering the age to initiate screening is in progress, as there is an increase in colorectal incidence in people born after 1970.","129":"Cloud computing is among the most beneficial solutions to digital problems. Security is one of the focal issues in cloud computing technology, and this study aims at investigating security issues of cloud computing and their probable solutions. A systematic review was performed using Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases. Once the title and abstract were evaluated, the quality of studies was assessed in order to choose the most relevant according to exclusion and inclusion criteria. Then, the full texts of studies selected were read thoroughly to extract the necessary results. According to the review, data security, availability, and integrity, as well as information confidentiality and network security, were the major challenges in cloud security. Further, data encryption, authentication, and classification, besides application programming interfaces (API), were security solutions to cloud infrastructure. Data encryption could be applied to store and retrieve data from the cloud in order to provide secure communication. Besides, several central challenges, which make the cloud security engineering process problematic, have been considered in this study.","130":"The appearance of urological complications is a major problem in obstetrics and gynecologic surgery; the bladder is the most common damaged organ. Due to a continuous increase in the rate of cesareans, the incidence of urologic complications will be potentially higher. We reviewed the most important risk factors for urinary tract injury and analyzed the strategies necessary to avoid these situations during vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). The risks and benefits of VBAC should be balanced before deciding the mode of delivery.","131":"Since December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a global health concern. The transmission method is human-to-human. Since this second wave of SARS-CoV-2 is more aggressive than the first wave, rapid testing is warranted to use practical diagnostics to break the transfer chain. Currently, various techniques are used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. A full review of online databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was analyzed to identify relevant articles focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosis and therapeutics. The most recent article search was on May 10, 2021. We summarize promising methods for detecting the novel Coronavirus using sensor-based diagnostic technologies that are sensitive, cost-effective, and simple to use at the point of care. This includes loop-mediated isothermal amplification and several laboratory protocols for confirming suspected 2019-nCoV cases, as well as studies with non-commercial laboratory protocols based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a field-effect transistor-based bio-sensing device. We discuss a potential discovery that could lead to the mass and targeted SARS-CoV-2 detection needed to manage the COVID-19 pandemic through infection succession and timely therapy.","132":"","133":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a spectrum of genetically and clinically heterogeneous diseases leading to the progressive degeneration of peripheric motor neurons with subsequent muscle weakness and atrophy. More than 95% of the cases of SMA are represented by homozygous mutations of the SMN1 gene (5q-SMA). Because this disease represents the leading cause of death due to a genetic cause and due to the availability of genetic therapies which can now save the life of the patient and stop the progress of the disease, early diagnosis is crucial. This report presents the case of a 13-year-old patient admitted to our hospital in 2018 who presented a phenotype typical to 5q-SMA. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of the SMN1 gene were performed, and a negative result was obtained. Consequently, we continued testing using whole-exome sequencing and discovered three mutations in the ASAH1 gene (one pathogenic and two variants of uncertain significance). Pathogenic mutations in the ASAH1 gene are responsible for spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) and Farber disease, which overlapped with our patient's phenotype. Currently, there are 45 SMA cases caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene reported worldwide; however, the present case is the first reported in Romania.","134":"Thromboses of the upper extremity and neck are rare and not as commonly seen as lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJVT) is a serious condition with a potentially fatal outcome. Jugular vein thrombosis refers to the formation of intraluminal thrombi anywhere from the intracranial part of the jugular vein to the junction between the internal jugular vein (IJV) and subclavian vein. The relationship between malignancy and thromboembolic disorders has been well established, as Trousseau first described it in 1865. Tumor cells are known to promote hypercoagulability by expressing tissue factors that activate clotting cascades and procoagulants while promoting interactions between the tumor cells, platelets, and endothelial cells via different cytokines, tumor antigens, and their immune complexes. We are reporting our encounter with a patient who presented with extensive left internal jugular vein thrombosis as the first presenting sign of primary lung malignancy.","135":"This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of health education in the Tatarstan Republic by establishing educational programs - Health Schools - for groups of patients with a high risk of developing potentially fatal cardiac and respiratory conditions. The concept of \"Life Course Health Development\" implies the development of mechanisms for personalized health management. The goal of the study is to explore the effectiveness of the specialized Health Schools in Tatarstan. For the comparative study of health education effects on the overall state of personal health, 590 patients were surveyed in a randomized controlled trial. The groups of patients were compared in relation to their health education; their health status was observed prior to and afterward undergoing the educative preventative programs and estimated in comparison between the two groups. Extrapolation of the data on Tatarstan's patient population was obtained through this study, taking into account the state of health of the Health Schools students, obtaining the regression equations of population mortality and the effects of training on it. The effectiveness of Health Schools for patients with cardiovascular pathology has been proven. However, additional efforts are required to involve a wider range of patients and increase learning effectiveness to critical levels of awareness by introducing new forms of education in Health Schools since it statistically significantly increased the awareness level regarding disease nature and preventive measures.","136":"The endogenous microbiome of the oral cavity plays an essential role in the development of periodontal disease. It also has a significant pathogenic effect on the inner-vation of the oral cavity organs. The experimental determination of the effectiveness of various drugs is required for the effective treatment of periodontal disease, and this involves the creation of a model of experimental periodontitis. The objective of this series of studies was to determine the possibility of reproduction of the experimental model of periodontitis and the study of the effects of anticholinergic drugs on the development of an experimental periodontitis model. The reproduction of the experimental model of periodontitis was performed by injecting the gums of rats with solutions of pathogenic factors: lipopolysaccharide, hyaluronidase and trypsin. We aimed to study the effect of anticholinergic drugs (pilocarpine and atropine) on the development of an experimental model of periodontitis after the injection of a hyaluronidase solution (2 mg\/ml) into the rats' gums. The study was performed on white Wistar rats. Elastase activity, malonic dialdehyde content, urease activity (bacterial contamination index), lysozyme activity (an indicator of nonspecific immunity), and catalase activity (an antioxidant enzyme) were determined in the homogenate of the studied tissues. The results of a comparative study of the effect of three pathogenic factors (lipopolysaccharide, hyaluronidase, and trypsin) on the activity of elastase in different tissues of experimental animals (gums, tooth pulp, serum, and gastric mucosa) showed that hyaluronidase has the greatest proinflammatory effect. The action of pilocarpine and atropine was determined with an underline experimental periodontitis model. It was shown that both anticholinergic drugs stimulate the inflammatory process in the periodontium and that anticholinergic drugs enhance the proinflammatory effect of hyaluronidase.","137":"In this study, we would like to draw attention to the advanced disc diseases seen in young people. The objective is to investigate the reasons for the increasing trend of disc herniations in young people. A total of 33 young patients with extruded lumbar disc herniations managed by conservative or surgical approaches between 2017 and 2018 were included. The average patient age was 25 years. Smoking, familial predisposition, sporting activity, and the occupation of the patients were questioned and noted. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the efficacy of pain. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated. All patients were subjected to lumbar magnetic resonance imaging. Eighteen patients (8 females, 10 males) had disc extrusion at the L5-S1 level, whereas 12 patients (8 females, 4 males) had disc extrusion at the L4-L5 level. Three other patients had disc extrusion at the level of both L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. Motor deficits were detected in four patients, and surgical treatment was required and performed. The other 29 patients were treated conservatively. Young non-sport-oriented patients may face severe disc herniations. Understanding how spine degeneration can affect the likelihood of developing a herniated disc can help people make small lifestyle changes to postpone any serious pain and deficits. While aging is unavoidable, simple lifestyle changes can help improve overall spine health and deter the risk of developing a degenerative spine condition.","138":"Owing to the early tooth loss in a large population, the need for removable prosthodontic therapy has widely increased. Loss of teeth can occur due to trauma, periodontal disease, dental caries, and\/or oral health negligence. The removable prosthesis is preferred over other teeth replacement methods owing to its cost-effectiveness. However, due to continuous alveolar bone resorption, relining of the removable prosthesis is needed regularly. We aimed to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and bone turnover marker concerning bone mineral density. Eighty complete denture wearers either in the maxilla or in the mandible or both constituted the study sample. Before the study, all subjects were explained the procedures of the study, and informed consent was obtained before proceeding with the study. Subjects were instructed to provide an early morning sample in a fasting state as serum osteocalcin (OCN) and C-terminal telopeptide (C-Tx) have diurnal variations. Blood samples were collected, and samples were ruled out for 25-OH vitamin D, serum OCN, and C-TX. To determine the association between frequency of relining and bone turnover marker, the collected data were subjected to statistical evaluation. Significant correlations were seen between bone C-Tx, turnover markers (p&lt;0.001), and frequency of denture relining and osteocalcin (p&lt;0.001). No statistically significant effect of gender, vitamin D levels, age, calcium levels, vitamin D supplements, and diabetes was seen on denture relining frequency. The present study concludes that an elevated level of the bone turnover markers such as OCN and C-Tx increases the frequency of relining.","139":"The severity of motor impairment and the psycho-emotional and social consequences of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) impact both children and their families, who must adapt using cognitive-emotional strategies. We aimed to determine whether the domains of quality of life and the consequent emotion regulation strategies could be related, and if so, to what quantitative, at a statistically significant level. This study was conducted at the Dr. N. Robanescu National Clinical Center of Neurorehabilitation for Children and included 33 mothers questioned using the PedsQL-Family Impact Module (PedsQL-FIM) and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Statistical analysis of PedsQL-FIM data showed high positive Spearman's rho correlations between communication and social functioning (p=0.719), daily activities and cognitive functioning (p=0.704), family relationships and daily activities (p=0.705). The analysis of the Spearman's rho correlation coefficients reflected some moderate positive correlations between CERQ subscales: self-blame and catastrophizing (p=0.577), acceptance and refocus on planning (p=0.577), acceptance and putting into perspective (p=0.532), refocus on planning and positive reappraisal (p=0.630), positive reappraisal and putting into perspective (p=0.609). Maladaptive strategies affect family relationships, cognitive and social functioning, emotional functioning, and communication inside the family. Positive correlations were found between the adaptive strategies (acceptance, refocus on planning, putting into perspective, positive reappraisal) in the participants within our study group, showing their interest in attitude changing and actively solving the family tasks related to children's illness.","140":"Prosthetic rehabilitation of a partial or total maxillectomy with an obturator is the most acceptable treatment option. The hollowing of the obturator prosthesis is beneficial as it reduces the stresses over the underlying and surrounding tissues. A simple technique of fabricating a hollow bulb obturator has been discussed in this article. At the step of the packing of a denture, the hollow wax pattern of the defect area is formed with modeling wax. This hollow wax pattern is filled with water and is allowed to freeze to form an ice block. This ice block is removed from the wax pattern and is interposed between two layers for heat-cured acrylic resin and is then cured. After processing the denture, the water is retrieved by making a small hole in denture base, which is packed after hollowing with a cold cure acrylic resin. A lightweight prosthesis with a uniform thickness was achieved with a readily available and easily retrievable material, i.e., ice.","141":null,"142":null,"143":"Erosive tooth wear (ETW) refers to the chemical dissolution of mineralized tissues by acids of non-bacterial origin. It occurs in the primary as well as the permanent dentition. In this study, our objectives were to investigate and compare the impact of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), essential oils (EO), and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) on ETW protection produced by conventional fluoride kinds of toothpaste. A clinically relevant in-vitro erosion\/abrasion pH cycling model was employed to test the effect of the aforementioned mouthwashes on modulating the ability of NaF and SnF2 types of toothpaste. The mean dentin surface loss associated with NaF toothpaste was significantly lower than for the SnF2 toothpaste. On the other hand, enamel surface loss with SnF2 toothpaste was significantly lower than for the NaF toothpaste. Also, the surface loss of erosion was significantly higher when associated with abrasion than without brushing and for both enamel and dentin. There was no significant difference in the surface loss among all types of mouthwash. Commonly used types of mouthwash containing antimicrobial agents or additional fluoride do not impact fluoride toothpaste action on erosion\/abrasion. Also, considering erosion only, the tested SnF2 dentifrice provided better protection against surface loss of enamel than the other.","144":null,"145":"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia espoused \"Vision 2030\" as a strategy for economic development and national growth. The vision demonstrated the Kingdom's objectives to become a pioneer nation globally by achieving three main goals: a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation. To fulfill this, the Kingdom launched a national transformation program (NTP) as outlined in \"vision 2030\" in June 2016. The health care transformation is one of the eight themes of the NTP's. The history of health care facilities in the Kingdom is almost a century. Although the Kingdom has made notable progress in improving its population's health over recent decades, it needs to modernize the health care system to reach the \"vision 2030\" goal. This article aims to describe the new Model of Care (MOC) according to the recent Saudi health care transformation under the Kingdom's vision 2030. The MOC concept started with understanding the current state and collecting learnings. It is based on the six systems of care (SOC)- keeping well, planned procedure, women &amp; children, urgent problems, chronic conditions, and the last phase of life. The SOC is cut across different \"service layers\" to support people's stay well and efficiently get them healthy again when they need care. The new MOC describes a total of forty-two interventions, of which twenty-seven split across the six SOC and the rest fifteen cut-across the multiple SOC. Implementation of all MOC interventions will streamline the Saudi health care system to embrace the Kingdom's \"vision 2030\".","146":"Canal filling must be well adapted to the walls of the root canal to prevent bacterial infiltration. Endodontic seals play an essential role in ensuring tightness, without which the canal filling would suffer infiltrations. This study aimed to evaluate the areas occupied by the two components of the canal filling, as well as the sealer\/gutta-percha ratio in the root canals of the maxillary central incisors after their filling using the cold lateral condensation technique with gutta-percha. Thirty extracted upper central incisors were rotatably prepared with ProTaper Universal up to F3 and sealed using the cold lateral condensation technique with gutta-percha. After setting the sealer, the roots of the teeth were sectioned perpendicularly to 1 (L1), 3 (L3), 6 (L6), and 8 (L8) mm from the apex. The surface of the sections was analyzed with a Leica EZ4D stereomicroscope and photographed at two magnification orders: 10x and 25x. The areas corresponding to the gutta-percha, sealer, gaps, and root canal were expressed in pixels using the ImageJ software, version 1.50i. The difference in the representation of sealer areas, gutta-percha and voids was statistically significantly different for all four sections analyzed. The best adaptation of the canal obturation was observed in L1 and L3. The gutta-percha area was statistically significantly higher than that of the sealer for the L1, L3, and L6 levels, while the sealer\/gutta-percha ratio recorded the lowest value at the L3 level (0, 30) and the highest at its L8 (0.70) level, without registering statistically significant differences regarding the area at the four analyzed levels. The voids were mostly absent or recorded a minimal percentage area (&lt;1%). Cold lateral condensation of gutta-percha has led to a good adaptation of gutta-percha to the root canal wall, with a small amount of sealer, especially to the sections made at 3 mm from the apex. Given the limitations of this study, we noted that the voids were few - observed in the 6 and 8 mm sections - and were negligible in many cases.","147":"Breast cancers are very heterogeneous tissues constituted by epithelial cancer cells and an abnormal tumor microenvironment - cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), activated adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and others. The aim of the study is to cancer cells and their microenvironment, which behave like a complex and heterogeneous metabolic ecosystem, where cancer cells can reprogram their metabolism as a result of interaction with the components of the microenvironment. The study was based on cancer stem cells (CSC) that were isolated from breast tumors by magnetic separation (AutoMACS). We used spectrophotometric methods for the measurement of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymatic activity. For these experiments, we used breast cancer and normal stem cell lines. Analyses showed that the proportion of BRCA+ CSC cells was in accordance with the relatively low percentages of CSCs in BRCA+ tumors. ALHD was significantly higher in the CSCs-high BRCA+ breast cancer and CSCs-low BRCA- breast cancer cells, compared with the CSCs-low BRCA+ breast cancer. Breast cancer from BRCA mutation carriers harbor more \"high-energy\" cell sub-populations than \"low-energy\" and have their more aggressive phenotype. Key oncogenic pathways known to be dysregulated in breast cancer also regulate stem-cell behavior.","148":"Nausea and vomiting are some of the most common complaints of patients after any anesthesia, which is often associated with postoperative pain. The double-blind clinical trial study aimed to compare the prophylactic effect of dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine and their combination in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One hundred sixty-two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled in the study. In the first group of patients, 25 mg of dexmedetomidine were administered slowly. In comparison, the patients in the second group received dexamethasone (4 ml\/2 mg) with 0.1 mg\/kg of normal saline solution. The third group received a combination of dexmedetomidine and dexamethasone. Hemodynamic changes were recorded during surgery and after surgery, and the patients were admitted to recovery. Nausea and vomiting scores were recorded 2 and 4 hours after surgery. Blood pressure and heart rate were lower in the dexmedetomidine group at all times (P&lt;0.05). Two hours after surgery, the dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine combination group had less vomiting (P=0.012). The incidence of nausea 2 and 4 hours after surgery was lower in the dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine combination group (P&lt;0.05). Blood pressure and heart rate were lower in the dexmedetomidine group at all times. The dexmedetomidine and dexamethasone combination decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients. Therefore, we recommend using a dexmedetomidine and dexamethasone combination for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting.","149":null,"150":"Crohn's disease is characterized by persistent or recurrent chronic inflammation that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. It has an oscillating evolution, with periods of activity alternating with periods of remission. Crohn's disease has a significant impact on the economic status due to its increasing prevalence, often affecting young people. Suitable management for these patients involves frequent evaluations. Even though colonoscopy is the gold standard for the assessment of severity and mucosal healing, it is an invasive maneuver, not easily accepted by patients, and it does not have good repeatability. Intestinal ultrasound has the advantage of being non-irradiating, non-invasive, well-tolerated, cheap, and easy to repeat. Ultrasound parameters such as bowel wall thickness, intestinal wall architecture, intramural vascularisation, proliferation of mesenteric fatty conjunctive tissue, and intraperitoneal fluid can provide good information regarding the severity of the disease, the differentiation between remission and relapse, and its complications. Some of the latest studies show good correlations between ultrasound parameters and inflammation markers (C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin) and clinical severity scores of Crohn's disease. Consequently, the importance of intestinal ultrasound has increased lately, and recent studies support its use to evaluate the severity of inflammation, differentiate between active disease and relapse, monitor therapy response and guide treatment, evaluate prognosis, and diagnose complications.","151":"Accessing the veins for blood delivery, sampling or nutrition is a critical factor in the process of care and management of pediatric patients. In this regard, the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is one of the main alternatives which could be applied effectively as traditional central venous devices in neonates and adults. Due to their essential role in providing safe central venous entry, PICCs could be applied extensively in patients who are critically ill. The main aims of the present study are to review approximately all relevant publications concerning PICC procedures, any possible complications, and the most appropriate decision for preventing these complications due to their high mortality rate. We carried out a comprehensive search on PubMed, HubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases for identifying the most relevant publications related to potential complications following the application and insertion of PICCs in hospitalized children and infants. Through appropriate care of catheters, the rate of possible infectious, mechanical and thrombotic complications would decrease considerably compared to those patients who received traditional central venous catheters. However, the process of vascular access in neonatal and children is very challenging. Any delay or denying treatment due to the lack of vascular access is intolerable. In this regard, anesthesiologists must achieve extra knowledge of various vascular devices.","152":"","153":"A hopeless tooth from a periodontal point of view, with severe bone resorption, mobility and abnormal tooth migration, is often extracted. In advanced cases, function and esthetics are impaired, and an interdisciplinary treatment is requested. Retaining or not these teeth is based on clinician judgment. A growing body of evidence claims that prognosis has great potential to be improved in a motivated patient with good oral hygiene and regular maintenance. This case report aims to present a periodontal regenerative technique combining enamel matrix protein derivatives and a particulated xenograft to treat intraosseous defects caused by periodontitis. The patient healed uneventfully, and no complications were recorded after the surgical procedure. To correct abnormal tooth migration and improve function and esthetics, orthodontic treatment was instituted. Tooth prognosis improved from hopeless to questionable. This approach extended the life span of a compromised tooth, improving periodontal support and decreasing tooth mobility. This could be an alternative to extraction and implant.","154":"We are reporting a case of spontaneous acute esophageal necrosis \"black esophagus\" of unclear etiology in a kidney transplant recipient. A patient with end-stage renal disease due to IgA nephropathy received a deceased-donor kidney transplant. The surgical procedure was uneventful, without hemodynamic instability. He was started on alemtuzumab for immunosuppression induction followed by maintenance immunosuppression with intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, then oral prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (a target level between 8 and 10ng\/ml) daily. On postoperative day (POD) 3, the patient started to develop significant gastro-intestinal symptoms: epigastric pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, eructation, pyrosis, nausea, and regurgitation of food contents. He was diagnosed with esophageal necrosis by upper endoscopy on postoperative day 4. We describe a successful treatment with supportive therapy and complete recovery despite receiving immunosuppressive therapy. To our knowledge, this case is one of the few reported cases of esophageal necrosis in kidney transplant recipients and the first case that was not associated with clinical risk factors.","155":"We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of maternal renal vasculature Doppler ultrasound indices in the prediction of preeclampsia. A total of 40 pregnant women with a gestational age of more than 20 weeks were included and followed. The pregnant women underwent a Doppler ultrasound examination to measure the resistance index (RI) of the interlobar arteries of right and left kidneys and the renal interlobar vein impedance index (RIVI). Of the included women, 15 patients developed preeclampsia based on clinical and laboratory criteria. The renal vascular Doppler ultrasound indices were compared between the two groups. Then, using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of interlobar artery RI and RIVI were investigated in the prediction of preeclampsia occurrence. RIVI values of right and left kidneys were significantly higher in the preeclampsia group compared to the normal pregnancy group. The left kidney interlobar artery RI at a cut-point of 0.59 had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 40% (area under curve=0.7, P-0.03) in the prediction of preeclampsia. The RIVI of the left kidney (adjusted odds ratio=17.14, 95% CI = 3.46 to 47.28) was statistically significant in predicting preeclampsia (P-0.006). We found that, besides other routine methods, using Doppler ultrasound and measuring RIVI can be reliable in the prediction of preeclampsia.","156":"The aim of this case study was to identify effective marketing management strategies in the Emergency Care Department of a Romanian Emergency Hospital. An observational design study was conducted, and the instrument for collecting the data was the self-administered questionnaire. Out of 100 questionnaires completed, 74 proved to be valid. The statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics software version 20 and Microsoft Office Excel 2013. Quantitative variables were described by means and standard deviations, whereas for the qualitative variables, frequencies and percentages were used. Most of the respondents were aged between 28 and 35 years (33.8%) and women (60.8%). The emergency room (ER) physicians identified the following factors as being important in becoming very good doctors: continuous specialization (81.1%), reading medical literature (78.4%), and getting involved in more complicated cases (78.4%). The ER physicians mentioned that most of their patients were satisfied with the medical information received (31.1%), properly understood the medical information received (18.9%), and 68.9% of the doctors considered that patients were showing them total respect. Although 40.5% of the ER physicians declared they were suffering from burnout, 25.7% felt satisfied and joyful in their daily activities. Today's context triggered the need to integrate the concept of consumer value-driven care in the health care system, especially in the ER departments, by implementing the principles of efficient marketing management practices.","157":null,"158":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020. In Romania, there have been 983,217 confirmed cases and 24,386 deaths. We aim to show our experience at the Fundeni Clinical Institute in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in both patients and health care personnel. Swab samples were collected for extraction of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 29380 patients and health care personnel. We have combined three real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the presence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was analyzed in 1068 patients and clinical staff using the chemiluminescence method. Other 50 people were screened post-vaccination for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike (S) protein, using the chemiluminescence method as well. The majority of confirmed cases were in adults, 71.3% of cases being registered in people aged 30-69 years. Most patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (83%) were admitted to the gastroenterology, hematology, and surgery wards. Our study showed that one-third of people developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence does not vary by gender or age. Also, we noticed the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in all 50 people post-vaccination that were tested two weeks after the second dose. Due to the increasing number of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus pandemic involves a sustained testing effort for an accurate virological diagnosis in both direct and indirect diagnosis.","159":"This was a clinical trial study that aimed to investigate the efficacy of vaginal chlorhexidine gel in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and nonspecific vaginitis. The study population included patients who complained of vaginal discharge and presented to our University Gynecology Clinic. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The student t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the quantitative and ordinal data, respectively. In order to analyze the qualitative data, the Chi-square or Fischer's exact tests were used. The mean satisfaction score in the vulvovaginal candidiasis patients who received chlorhexiine vaginal gel was 9.06 and 8.29 in the patients who received clotrimazole vaginal cream. The Mann-Whitney test did not show a statistically significant difference between mean scores of VAS in these two groups with vulvovaginal candidiasis (P=0.027). Among the patients with bacterial vaginosis, the mean satisfaction score was 8.91 in the chlorhexidine vaginal gel group and 8.72 in the metronidazole tablet group (P=0.607). In the nonspecific vaginitis group, the mean satisfaction score was 8.83 in the chlorhexidine vaginal gel group and 9.17 in the combination group (metronidazole + clotrimazole vaginal cream)(P=0.401). The highest mean visual analog scale score (VAS) score was documented in the combination therapy group. We found that chlorhexidine vaginal gel is a more effective method for the treatment and improvement of vaginal infections. The benefits of chlorhexidine gel have a positive therapeutic effect as a single drug in nonspecific vaginitis, rather than simultaneous administration of two agents.","160":null,"161":"The aim of the study was to evaluate if bioresonance therapy can offer quantifiable results in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder and with mild, moderate, or severe depressive episodes by decreasing the level of depression due to the application of bioresonance therapy as independently or complementary treatment. The study included 140 patients suffering from depression, divided into three groups. The first group (40 patients) received solely bioresonance therapy, the second group (40 patients) received pharmacological treatment with antidepressants combined with bioresonance therapy, and the third group (60 patients) received solely pharmacological treatment with antidepressants. The assessment of depression was made using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, with 17 items, at the beginning of the bioresonance treatment and the end of the five weeks of treatment, aiming to decrease the level of depression. The study identified the existence of a statistically significant difference for the treatment methods applied to the analyzed groups (p=0.0001), and we found that the therapy accelerates the healing process in patients with depressive disorders. Improvement was observed for the analyzed groups, with a decrease of the mean values between the initial and final phase of the level of depression, of delta for Hamilton score of 3.1, 3.8 and 2.3, respectively. We concluded that the bioresonance therapy could be useful in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder with moderate depressive episodes independently or as a complementary therapy to antidepressants.","162":null,"163":"With the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, the neurological complications reported during or after the infection became more common. There is limited knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms that are responsible for these complications. Recent data provides compelling evidence for the neurotropic nature of SARS-CoV-2, based on neurological manifestations reported during the current pandemic, as well as on previous experience with other coronaviruses. We present the case of a patient who developed headaches, motor deficit and dysphasia after respiratory COVID-19. Imaging tests showed heterogeneous central nervous system lesions (multiple subarachnoid hemorrhages and two ischemic strokes). Given the plethora of atypical neurological complications of COVID-19 described in the current literature, establishing a positive diagnosis and deciding on a treatment plan proved to be particularly challenging. We set to discuss some of the possible pathologies, hypothesized to be associated with COVID-19, that could lead to concomitant neurological lesions, similar to those noticed in our patient.","164":null,"165":"During the first two months of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, Romania was in lockdown, and all dental practices were closed, so orthodontic patients had to postpone their check-ups for at least eight weeks. This led not only to a delayed end of treatment but also to accidents and complications. The present study tried to evaluate the orthodontic situation both from the patient's and orthodontist's point of view, so the patients were given a few questions to answer, and the orthodontist analyzed each treatment before and after the two-month lockdown and decided if it was mildly or severely affected by the absence of check-ups. The study group consisted of 105 patients evaluated by three orthodontists in the same private practice. Patients that have gotten worse after the lockdown or who had problems were included in the study. Also, all the patients were given a 7-question form in order to find out their opinion. After two months without check-ups, our orthodontists found that 9.52% got worse because of the lack of intermaxillary elastics, broken brackets, broken removable orthodontic appliances, and others. Most of the patients believe that their treatment was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, but none of the patients felt unsafe when visiting the clinic. The Covid-19 pandemic had severe effects on orthodontic treatments. Orthodontists noticed a delay for about one-third of their patients. However, from the patient's point of view, half believe that their treatment was negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in different degrees.","166":"Marriage is highly respected and somehow sacred in eastern societies, including Iran. This qualitative research aimed to explore lived experience of remarried men and women who had experienced divorce in their relationships with their significant others. Seventeen remarried-after-divorce persons whose second marriage lasted over two years participated in the study, conducted using the content analysis method. Under the theme of inter-relationships, four categories were found, including \"different spouses, different relations\", \"reconfiguration of relationships with families\", \"impacts on child-rearing\", and \"the importance of unimportant acquaintances\". This study showed the complexity of the relationship network when another marriage happens after the first one collapsed. The other finding was that relations after divorce might not disappear completely, and relics of the first ruined shared life may strongly affect the new partnership. The influence of context-oriented issues, particularly in societies where religion and tradition are strong, was the other result. This study showed that remarriage after divorce has positive and negative consequences. Professionals, policymakers and researchers may apply the findings of the research by taking a strengths perspective.","167":null,"168":null,"169":"Gangliogliomas are central nervous system tumors located in the temporal lobe of young patients, frequently associated with epilepsy. In this paper, we propose a grading system based solely on histopathological criteria. We reevaluated all cases of ganglioglioma, atypical ganglioglioma, and anaplastic ganglioglioma diagnosed between 2011 and 2020 in the Pathology Department of the Emergency Clinical Hospital Bagdasar-Arseni, based on the type of glial mitoses, the number of neuronal and glial mitoses, presence of necrosis, microvascular proliferation, eosinophilic granular bodies, hypercellularity, presence and disposition of inflammatory infiltrate and atypical pleomorphism. Based on the proposed grading system, a score of 0-4 corresponded to a benign ganglioglioma, 5-9 to an atypical ganglioglioma, and 10-18 to an anaplastic ganglioglioma. The survival rates were 90% for benign ganglioglioma, 71.43% for atypical ganglioglioma, and 62.54% for anaplastic ganglioglioma. One case of benign ganglioglioma underwent a malignant transformation into anaplastic ganglioglioma, and recurrences were noticed in 28.57% of atypical ganglioglioma cases and 30.7% of all anaplastic gangliogliomas. The presence of rare glial mitoses and hypercellularity was correlated with mortality in cases of atypical ganglioglioma. We believe this histopathological scoring system could be used as a three-tier system to identify atypical ganglioglioma cases that are bound to have an aggressive course of evolution and require close follow-up. The other option would be to convert it to a two-tier grading system that can separate low-grade gangliogliomas from high-grade ones. The latter category can encompass both atypical and anaplastic ganglioglioma due to the high mortality of both entities.","170":"Tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy is not only a matter of the past; it is also a current problem. These days, TB appears through mass migration and tourism in countries where it was believed that this condition is eradicated. Adequate knowledge about the medical history of patients, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis should be part of the armamentarium of each physician involved in clinical practice. TB is mainly found in urban and socially deprived areas. Due to the length of the treatment, there is an increased risk of drug resistance in partially treated patients. Strong knowledge about the history, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment of TB should be part of the armamentarium of each physician. Many practitioners are reluctant to request a chest X-ray in pregnancy due to the fear of harming the fetus. Bypassing a diagnosis can have a devastating effect on the mother and fetus, as well as their family and medical staff. This article discusses the matters of diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic infection and active TB in pregnancy.","171":"Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) encompass a wide array of ailments affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), muscles of mastication, and the allied structural framework. Myofascial pain, internal derangement of the joint, and degenerative joint diseases constitute the majority of TMDs. TMDs usually have a multifactorial etiology, and treatment modalities range from conservative therapies to surgical interventions. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has evolved as an efficient non-invasive therapeutic modality in TMDs. Previously conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown variable results regarding the efficiency of LLLT in TMJ disorder patients. Hence, this systematic review was carried out as an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of LLLT in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorder patients.","172":"The last decades showed a worrying increase in the evolution of cardiovascular diseases towards different stages of heart failure (HF), as a stigma of the western lifestyle. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), non-coding RNAs, which are approximately 22-nucleotide long, were shown to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of HF. miRNAs research is of high interest nowadays, as these molecules display mechanisms of action that can influence the course of evolution of common chronic diseases, including HF. The potential of post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs concerning the diagnosis, management, and therapy for HF represents a new promising approach in the accurate assessment of cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to assess the current knowledge of miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases, especially right-sided heart failure and hepatomegaly. Moreover, attention is focused on their role as potential molecular biomarkers and more promising aspects involving miRNAs as future therapeutic targets in the pathophysiology of HF.","173":"This study attempted to review the evidence for or against the effectiveness of mobile health (m-health) interventions on health outcomes improvement and\/or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) management. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched from 2000 to 10 July 2018 to find studies investigating the effect of m-health on GDM management. After removing duplications, a total of 27 articles met our defined inclusion criteria. m-health interventions were implemented by smartphone, without referring to its type, in 26% (7\/27) of selected studies, short message service (SMS) in 14.9% (4\/27), mobile-based applications in 33.3% (9\/27), telemedicine-based on smartphones in 18.5% (5\/27), and SMS reminder system in 7.1% (2\/27). Most of the included studies (n=23) supported the effectiveness of m-health interventions on GDM management and 14.3% (n=4) reported no association between m-health interventions and pregnancy outcomes. Based on our findings, m-health interventions could enhance GDM patients' pregnancy outcomes. A majority of the included studies suggested positive outcomes. M-health can be one of the most prominent technologies for the management of GDM.","174":"Vitiligo, the discoloration of the skin, has different autoimmune mechanisms reflected by many biomarkers as shown by skin histology, staining for CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, chemokine ligand 9 or circulating cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, antibodies, markers of oxidative stress, chemokines, and others. In this narrative review, we aim to overview vitiligo in relationship with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Regarding vitiligo, more than 50 different genetic loci have been associated with this disease, and the heritability is high. There is a 20% risk of an environmental connection which may also act as a trigger; moreover, the association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression is well recognized. The specific lesions display CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells as continuous key activators of melanocytes. The association with chronic thyroiditis is based on common autoimmune background and excessive reactive oxygen species that destroy melanocytes and thyrocytes (oxidative stress hypothesis) with thyroxine and melanin as target molecules, thus sharing a common origin: tyrosine. Moreover, common epigenetic anomalies or mutations of the Forkhead transcription factor D3 (FOXD3) have been described. Since vitiligo affects up to 1-2% of the population worldwide and 34% of patients have positive thyroid antibodies, apart from common autoimmunity background and oxidative stress toxicity, the association is clinically relevant for different practitioners.","175":"","176":"This case report describes a rare case of progressive muscle weakness in a patient treated for eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) for many years before being diagnosed with a second autoimmune disease: dermatomyositis. Our case is a report of a 65-year-old male diagnosed with eosinophilic fasciitis 7 years before being evaluated in our service at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, due to progressive muscle weakness despite the chronic treatment with methotrexate. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the lower extremity showed enhancement throughout the thigh musculature, which led us to pursue biopsies of the fascia and muscle in order to confirm the diagnosis of EF associated with myopathy. This case illustrates the need to consider the possibility of myopathy in patients diagnosed with EF whenever muscle weakness is more prominent than expected.","177":"","178":"Candidal vaginitis has a relatively high prevalence, and its resistance to treatment is on the rise. Considering the complications of chemical drugs, the use of herbal medicines has now been favored due to the lack of changes in the normal vaginal flora. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Satureja khuzestanica and clotrimazole vaginal creams for the treatment of candidal vulvovaginitis. A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 84 reproductive-aged women in the city of Ahvaz, Iran. Individuals were randomly divided into two treatment groups: 1% Satureja khuzestanica vaginal creams (n=42) and 1% clotrimazole vaginal cream (n=42) who used a one-full applicator daily for one week. About 4-7 days after the end of treatment, a clinical examination and laboratory re-tests were performed to determine the level of treatment. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U, t-test and Chi-square tests, with SPSS version 22. After the treatment, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of vaginal discharge (p = 0.32), vaginal itching (p = 0.26), dysuria (p = 0.99) and dyspareunia (p = 0.60). Moreover, the results of culture (p = 0.62) and smear (p = 0.58) were not statistically significant in the two groups. Also, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of complete recovery after the treatment (p = 0.35). Satureja khuzestanica seems to have the same effect as clotrimazole in improving the symptoms of vaginal candidiasis, the negative results of culture and smear, as well as complete treatment.","179":"According to the definition adopted by the international biological program, physical performance is characterized by maximum oxygen consumption (MOC). Profession, lifestyle, and sport affect the value of the MOC. For anatomy and physiology, oxygen delivery to muscle tissue depends on the state of the respiratory and cardiovascular system, the amount and composition of blood. In this case, the leading role belongs to the cardiac activity, namely to the magnitude of the shock and minute volumes of blood in working conditions. High values of MOC and, consequently, a large work capacity are characteristic of athletes specializing in cyclic sports with moderate and high power. The purpose of the research was to evaluate the adaptive response of the cardiovascular system of girls involved in cyclic and acyclic sports as well as those not involved in sports. The study was conducted in 2018. During the research, we used pulse oximetry and determination of blood pressure according to N.S. Korotkov, as well as an assessment of the adaptation of the cardiovascular system according to the Ruffier Index. Studies have shown differences in the level of performance of girls involved in cyclic sports (athletics) and acyclic sports (karate and taekwondo), as well as non-sports. During the experiments, heart rate and blood pressure indicators were recorded at rest and after exercise, and the Ruffier Index, which reflects the level of performance of the participants, was calculated.","180":"Early mobilization (EM) of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a safe, feasible, and beneficial approach. However, the implementation of EM as a part of routine clinical care can be challenging. As a result, the present study aimed to identify the potential barriers to EM of ICU patients. The statistical population of this descriptive-analytical study included 107 critical care nurses working in hospitals affiliated with the Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences of Ahvaz. The participants were selected using the census method among the eligible critical care nurses, and the researcher-made questionnaire was used for data collection. This questionnaire included a demographic questionnaire and an inventory of barriers to EM. In total, 72% of the nurses had a highly positive attitude towards EM implementation, whereas relatively few had a slightly positive attitude. The major human-resource-related barriers included the lack of trained staff (76.6%), inadequate shift nurses (74%), and inadequate time for this procedure (57.9%). Approximately 88.9%, 82.2%, 62%, and 57.9% of the nurses reported coma or a deep degree of sedation, mobilization of obese patients, mobilization of patients with agitation, and pain, respectively, as the major patient-related barriers. The lack of EM implementation and recording according to the checklist (90.4%), the lack of an approved EM implementation protocol (88.8%), and inadequate equipment for the mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients (58%) were among the major equipment-related barriers. The participating nurses were aware of the EM advantages, and the majority of them had a highly positive attitude towards its implementation in the ICU. However, nurses believed that the actual EM implementation is associated with challenges such as human resources limitations, equipment-related barriers, and patient-related barriers.","181":"Intellectual property rights such as Copyright, Trademark, Patents and Trade secrets etc. help us to gain some protection against certain inventions by acknowledging the founder. In today's industry it is agreed that Intellectual Property Rights has a big role to play. This current study envisages the knowledge, attitude, practice regarding Intellectual Property Rights among dental task force attending private dental colleges.The survey was conducted among students of which were Interns, Post Graduates, faculty members and other dental surgeons attending private dental colleges in Navi Mumbai. The subjects of this study comprised of a total of 1020 students, faculty members and other dental surgeons from five different private dental institutes. The survey includes closed ended questions. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 17. Explaining calculations were used to summarize all the answers. A total of 889 students, faculty and other dental surgeons from private dental colleges responded. Results showed that about 83.5% believe the statement \"Articles and other publications are protected by copyright.\" 66.6% of participants would select trademark in order to protect their clinic or organization name. About 38.7% were aware of the term Intellectual Property Rights. It also suggests that only 10.9% have attended any seminar\/conference pertaining to IPR. The students and faculty members have an overall sense of eagerness to learn and gain more knowledge based on IPR. Thus conducting more workshops and seminars based on IPR should be encouraged.","182":null,"183":null,"184":"Our objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado and appendicitis inflammatory response (AIR) scoring systems among children suspected of acute appendicitis concerning their postoperative outcomes. During a two-year period, a prospective multicentric study was carried in the selected hospitals of Iran. All children who were admitted with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were enrolled in the study. However, patients suffering from generalized peritonitis or those who had a history of abdominal surgery were excluded. Before decision-making, each patient's score according to two appendicitis scoring systems was calculated. The clinical outcomes and diagnosis of patients were then compared to the results of each scoring system. For those patients who were a candidate for surgery, the final diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made by histopathology. Patients were divided into a high- and low-risk group according to scoring systems outcomes. Among the patients with a low score for appendicitis, the AIR scoring system had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 74%, respectively, which was more promising in comparison to that of the Alvarado system (90% and 70%, respectively). Regarding the patients at higher risk of acute appendicitis, none of the scoring systems provided reliable results since both systems showed sensitivity and specificity of less than 50%, which was not sufficient to distinguish patients who are a candidate for surgery. AIR and Alvarado scoring systems are not accurate models to predict the risk of acute appendicitis among children; however, the AIR system could be used as a reliable material to rule out the acute appendicitis diagnosis.","185":"This article highlights the results of a study of blood parameters in animals with simulated necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and compares them, under the same conditions, with animals that received local treatment with a developed complex of antioxidant drugs. Following the work tasks, the nature of changes in the state of the antioxidant - prooxidant system and their influence on quantitative and functional indicators of markers of inflammatory intensity was analyzed and investigated during the pathological process in the background and without treatment with a developed complex. This work shows the changes of malonic dialdehyde concentration as an indicator of lipid peroxidation intensity in experimental animals, the level of catalase activity in the blood of animals, and antioxidant-prooxidant balance in the dynamics of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.","186":"Typically, prosthodontists adjust ceramic restorations glazed surface by grinding prior to insertion. Such alterations of surfaces are necessary for the correction of occlusal interferences. We aimed to evaluate and compare the change in flexural strength of ceramic surfaces after re-glazing and polishing. This study included 40 samples of ceramic blocks that were fabricated and glazed, and then fired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The sample was randomly divided into four groups of 10 samples each. The first group was the control group with unaltered glazed samples. The second group was abraded with an extra-fine diamond bur followed by re-glazing, and the other two groups were polished with two commercially available polishing kits after abrading them with an extra-fine diamond bur. The samples were tested for their flexural strength using a universal testing machine. On the application of the F test on the means of all the groups, a value greater than 0.05 was found, which meant that there is no statistically significant difference in flexural strength values between the groups (P-value&gt;0.05). Since the flexural strength values of the polished group were comparable to the other groups, polishing can be used instead of re-glazing for ceramic restorations. This reduces an additional clinical appointment for the patient and saves working time.","187":"The infant's refusal to breastfeed can be a stressful and concerning matter for a mother. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and factors leading to nursing strikes in Rafsanjan city. This descriptive study was performed on infants who had been referred to the pediatrician's office with a complaint of a nursing strike. The research sample included 70 infants, and all the required data, including the causes of the nursing strike and the demographic information of the mother and the infant, were collected using a checklist. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20 was used to analyze the data. The percentage was used to express qualitative indices, and the mean and standard deviation were used to express quantitative indices. The results showed that the most common factors contributing to the infants' breast refusal were playfulness and distraction (50%) and recent vaccinations in the last 12 days (48.6%). Besides, the most common maternal factors affecting breast refusal were level of education (67.1%), recent acute stress (41.4%), and inadequate milk production (35.7%). The results of the present study showed that playfulness and distraction of the baby, recent vaccination, use of a pacifier, level of education and recent stress of the mother, breastfeeding program, and insufficient milk production are the most common reasons for nursing strikes.","188":"Pediatric biobanks are an indispensable resource for the research needed to bring advances in personalized medicine into pediatric medical care. It is unclear how or when these advances in medical care may reach children, but it is unlikely that research in adults will be adequate. We conducted the screening for a hypothetic problem in various European and American pediatric biobanks based on online surveys through e-mail distribution based on the Biobank Economic Modeling Tool (BEMT) questionnaire model. Participants in the survey had work experience in biobanking for at least 3 years or more. Contact information about the survey participants was confirmed on the social networks profiles (LinkedIn), as well as on generally available websites. First, we tried creating a model which can show the pediatric preclinical and basic clinical phase relationship and demonstrate how pediatric biobanking is linked to this process. Furthermore, we tried to look for new trends, and the final goal is to put the acquired knowledge into practice, so medical experts and patients could gain usable benefit from it. We concluded that leading positions must take into account ethical and legal aspects when considering the decision to include children in the biobank collection. However, communication with parents and children is essential. The biobank characteristics influence the biobank's motives to include children in the consent procedure. Moreover, the motives to include children influence how the children are involved in the consent procedure and the extent to which children are able to make voluntary decisions as part of the consent procedure.","189":null,"190":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that results from insufficient secretion or insulin resistance, or both. Insulin secretion deficiency leads to chronic hyperglycemia along with impaired metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. This study aimed to investigate the TP53 gene SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) rs1042522 genotype and the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene SNP rs1800795 genotype in DM and control groups. This study was performed on 70 patients with type 1 DM, 100 patients with type 2 DM without related complications, 66 control subjects for type 1 DM, and 95 control subjects for type 2 DM. The control groups were matched regarding age and gender and did not have a familial relationship with the patient groups. All the subjects were residents of Kermanshah, located in the western part of Iran. Polymorphisms of TP53 and IL-6 genes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c were measured using the ELISA and immunoturbidometric methods. The frequency of genotypes (CC, CG, GG) of the TP53 gene codon 72 in type 1 DM and its control group were significantly different (P= 0.013). Likewise, the frequency of genotypes (CC, CG, GG) of the TP53 gene codon 72 was significantly different between type 2 DM and control groups (P &lt;0.001). The frequency of genotypes (GG, GC, CC) of G174C polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene was different between type 1 DM and control group as well as between type 2 DM and its control group, but it was not statistically significant. SNP rs1042522 genotypes in the dominant form (CG + GG vs. CC) (OR= 3.880; P &lt; 0.001) and alleles G vs. C alleles (OR= 0.384; P &lt; 0.001) increased the risk of type 2 DM significantly. There was no significant difference between type 1 and type 2 DM groups and respected control groups regarding the frequency of the IL-6 gene SNP rs1800795 alleles. The G allele of SNP rs1042522 encoding the TP53 gene increases the risk of developing DM in the population of the Kermanshah province, Iran.","191":"Acute small bowel obstruction remains one of the most challenging nosologies in emergency surgery, leading to a pronounced imbalance between lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense system. We aimed to study changes in the anti- and prooxidant status of serum and small intestine wall in an experiment modeling acute small bowel obstruction. The control group included 11 rats, and the main group included 42 rats (simulation of mechanical bowel obstruction on day 1 was conducted in 14 rats, on day 2 - in 12 rats, on day 3 - in 16 rats). Acute small bowel obstruction was modeled by ligation. Serum analysis and removal of the small intestinal wall were performed on days 1, 2, and 3. Indicators of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant protection were determined by the spectrophotometric method, and the imbalance between lipid peroxidation and antioxidant protection gradually increased from 1 to 3 days of observation. On day 3, the low level of aldehyde increased 1.3 times, and the level of superoxide dismutase decreased 1.2 times compared to the control group. Pathophysiological changes in the wall of the small intestine are caused by the activation of lipid peroxidation and the exhaustion antioxidant protection, whereby the degree of their severity increases depending on the increase in time from the moment of modeling of acute obstruction of the small intestine.","192":"Patients whose with facial appearance involves dental anomalies and malocclusion face an increased prevalence of various psychosocial problems such as a high level of social anxiety, social avoidance, and low quality of life. This study investigates the patients with craniofacial anomalies and their psychological adjustment concerning the facial and dental appearance. It also evaluates the expectations of this patient group from the orthodontic treatment. Two steps were done in this study. In the first step, translation and validation of the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS59), The Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ), and Patient Expectation from the Orthodontic Treatment (PEOTQ) questionnaires into Maithili were done, and then the main study was conducted using these valid questionnaires. This was a cross-sectional study conducted on the patients with congenital craniofacial anomalies visiting the orthodontics department of Patna Dental College and Hospital, Patna (Bihar). All the patients received the Maithili DAS, Maithili PIDAQ and Patients' Expectation from the orthodontic treatment questionnaires. The Maithili version of DAS59, PIDAQ and PEOTQ were developed with outstanding reliability and validity. A significant difference between PIDAQ (p&lt;0.001) and DAS59 scores (p&lt;0.001) was found. In females, the total PIDAQ score was significantly higher as compared to males, but there was no association of DAS scores with gender. Place of residence showed no association with PIDAQ and DAS59 scores in patients. Patients and controls had significant differences between various items, and a comparison was made in terms of expectation from the orthodontic treatment. Altered facial and dental appearance in patients with craniofacial anomalies showed a significant psychological impact.","193":"The use of the PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in the treatment of breast cancer (BC) with germine mutations has evolved over the years, and further research has been done in order to broaden the horizon of this treatment strategy. Therefore the aim of this paper is to review the efficiency of PARPi in the treatment of BRCA 1\/2-mutated locally advanced and metastatic Her-2\/net negative BC mentioning their side effects, mechanism of resistance and future directions. Inhibition of PARP transforms single-strand breaks into double-strand breaks (DBS), the accumulation of the latter causing cell death (cell apoptosis). The Olympia AD phase III trial demonstrated a statistically significant progression-free survival rate (PFS) when using the PARPi olaparib in metastatic BC with germline BRCA1\/2 mutations without any benefit of the overall survival rate. PARPi therapy is associated with acceptable responsive rates and progression-free survival rates in locally advanced and metastatic BRCA1\/2 associated BC through mechanisms that enhance and increase the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic or target agents as they induce a synthetic lethality and cell apoptosis. The side effects are not significant, the most adverse effects being related to the hematological and gastrointestinal systems. Olaparib is currently approved in the first-line treatment of BRCA1\/2 mutated Her-2\/neu negative metastatic BC at an oral dose of 300 mg twice daily, while Talazoparib represents a category one recommendation in locally advanced and metastatic Her-2\/neu negative BC in women with central nervous system metastases.","194":"Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorders include several dysfunctions that ultimately lead to muscle weakness. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most prevalent NMJ disorder with a highly polymorphic clinical presentation and many different faces. Being an autoimmune disease, MG correlates with the presence of detectable antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase, lipoprotein-related protein 4, agrin, titin, and ryanodine in the postsynaptic membrane at the NMJ. MG has become a prototype serving to understand both autoimmunity and the function of the NMJ better. The aim of this review is to synthesize some of the epidemiological data available. Epidemiological data regarding MG are important for postulating hypotheses regarding its etiology and facilitating the description of MG subtypes. Thus, adequate documentation through broad databases is essential. The incidence and prevalence of MG reported around the globe have been rising steadily and consistently over the past decades. Ethnic aspects, gender-related differences, and environmental risk factors have been described, implying that these might contribute to a specific phenotype, further suggesting that MG may be considered an umbrella term that covers several clinical entities.","195":"Meningiomas are common primary tumors of the central nervous system. The incidence at the age of fertility is low, although there are some hormonal mechanisms involved. Growth in size was observed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which could lead to developing new symptoms during pregnancy or worsening of the already existing ones. Visual impairment is the chief complaint, followed by headache, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Diagnosis is based on neurological examination, ophthalmoscopy, imaging techniques like gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans, bearing in mind the patient's irradiation and prejudice on the fetus together with the histopathological examination. The objective of the review is to determine the influence of meningioma on pregnancy and vice-versa and provide a strategy of follow-up for maternal-fetal specialists and not only. We performed a systematic review by searching relevant information in PubMed and Wiley databases using keywords as meningioma, pregnancy, progesterone receptors. The results showed that besides a similar incidence of meningioma in pregnant and non-pregnant women, symptoms might flare during pregnancy due to water retention, engorgement of vessels, and the presence of sex hormone receptors on tumor cells. Meningioma may impact the route of pregnancy with adverse effects on the fetus. Thus, fetal monitoring by biophysical profile and cardiotocography (CTG) is needed. The preferred treatment option is surgery, but gestational age and the woman's status must be taken into consideration.","196":"","197":"Microscopic studies performed on extracted human teeth after their preparation in advance is helpful in a relatively good reestablishment of the treatment steps that have been applied to these teeth, as well as an evaluation of the quality of such treatments. Therefore, we have used stereo- and optical microscopy, highlighting aspects of external morphology, as well as root canal space of an extracted mandibular second premolar, subjected to prosthetic and endodontic treatment. In order to verify some technical errors that might occur during the endodontic and restorative treatment, we tried to appreciate the quality of the root canal filling and cervical defect and access cavity restoration of an extracted premolar #45.Without having the data from clinical records, we concluded that the method used for root canal filling was the warm lateral condensation technic; we also appreciated the quality of the fusion of the gutta-percha cones used, so the introduction of heated spreaders only in the central part of the bunch of cones makes it possible to clearly detect the boundaries between these cones towards the outside of the filling.","198":"This case report describes the diagnosis, multidisciplinary treatment, and long-term follow-up of a severely compromised tooth in a patient who was referred for assessing a gingival recession. Clinical evaluation of the left maxillary canine showed 12 mm of mid-buccal gingival recession, probing depth of 14 mm on the mesial-buccal aspect, and grade III mobility. A periapical radiograph revealed extensive periapical and lateral radiolucency. The first step of the treatment was to carry out oral hygiene instructions and full-mouth debridement. After that, endodontic treatment was performed immediately. Periodontal reevaluation four months after endodontic therapy revealed that probing depths of all sites were within 3 mm and periapical radiograph showed a slight decrease in periapical and lateral radiolucency. It was subsequently decided to perform root coverage with a laterally positioned flap and subepithelial connective tissue graft. Six months after surgery, the root surface showed 1 mm recession, representing root coverage of 91.7% and a gain of attachment of 13 mm. The patient was enrolled in a 6-month supportive periodontal therapy. Treatment outcomes were evaluated over 18 years, with successful radiographic and clinical results throughout the follow-up period. The successful management of endo-periodontal lesions requires an accurate diagnosis, which is imperative to provide proper therapy in the correct treatment sequence.","199":"Prenatal testing has been moving towards non-invasive methods to determine fetal risk for genetic disorders. Numerous studies have focused the attention on common trisomies; although the detection rate (DR) for trisomy 21 is high (over 95%), the accuracy regarding the DR for trisomies 13 and 18 has come under scrutiny. The testing has been applied to sex chromosome aneuploidies, but many studies have shown that it is not as effective as it is for common trisomies. Although non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) has become a standard screening procedure for all pregnant women, invasive sampling procedures remain important in confirming NIPT-positive findings. In the present study, we report discordant results of Turner syndrome (TS) mosaicism between NIPT and karyotyping. A 35-year-old pregnant woman underwent NIPT, and a probable risk for Xp deletion was indicated. Subsequently, amniocentesis was performed. The karyotype was identified as mos 45,X [28]\/46,X,i(X)(q1.0)[5]. In the second case, a 33-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis after a positive NIPT that indicated a probable risk for monosomy X. The result was mos 45,X [8]\/46,XY[8]. Since NIPT is a screening test, the possibility of false-positive or false-negative results should always be considered. We underline the importance of pre\/post detailed counseling. Furthermore, women with abnormal NIPT results should undergo immediate amniocentesis that remains the only tool for a correct diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidies.","200":null,"201":"The study aimed to identify certain factors related to family history, pathological conditions, or exposure-type that are significantly correlated with recurrent wheezing and\/or asthma in children. One hundred nine children with recurrent wheezing and 44 children with asthma were studied in order to identify the degree of correlation of these conditions with familial history of asthma or atopy, child's age group, gender, premature birth, perinatal asphyxia, neonatal infection, and antibiotic treatment during the neonatal period, history of atopy and obesity and histamine intolerance, nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization, pneumonia with bronchospasm. The clinical picture of these two diseases was also compared regarding the severity of exacerbations and their response to controller therapy. The medium age of children diagnosed with recurrent wheezing was significantly lower than those diagnosed with asthma (5.64 vs. 9.01 years; p&lt;0.001). Inside the recurrent wheezing group, age distribution differed significantly from the asthma group (p-value &lt;0.001). Atopy was the only pathological condition significantly associated with asthma (56.0%) when compared with the recurrent wheezing group (30.2%) with a relative risk value of 1.34 (p&lt;0.004). For patients colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, the medium number of wheezing exacerbations was significantly higher (p&lt;0.049). Approximately 91% of patients in the recurrent wheezing group and 71% from the asthma group responded to appropriate controller treatment. Our study showed a significant association between asthma and atopy, justifying the need to monitor asthma risk in a child with wheezing and atopy. Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus proved to be significantly associated with the recurrence of wheezing in children.","202":"Metabolic syndrome (Mets) is a set of metabolic disorders including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance or disorders of glucose absorption and metabolism, lipid disorders, and hypertension, which increases the risk of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mortality. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the trend of Mets and its components in Zahedan, a city located in South-East of Iran, from 2009 to 2017. A total of 761 individuals aged &gt;20 years were followed from 2009 to 2017. The frequency of metabolic syndrome was measured at two-time points based on four criteria: International Diabetes Federation (IDF), National Cholesterol Education Program-Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP III), Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), and American Heart Association and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (AHA\/NHLBI). The prevalence of Mets ranged from 16.6 (95% CI: 13.9 - 19.2) (ATP III) to 23.70% (95% CI: 20.6 - 26.6) (AHA\/NHLBI) in 2009. Accordingly, it increased from 5.2% to 7.3% during the study period using different criteria such that the frequency of Mets varied from 21.8 (95% CI: 18.8 - 24.7) (ATP III) to 31.0% (95% CI: 27.7 - 34.3) (AHA\/NHLBI) in 2017. The increasing trend was prominent among females, persons aged &lt;40 years, and those with the lowest educational level. Two components of Mets (abdominal obesity and diabetes) increased in prevalence, whereas elevated blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL declined. The study revealed an annual increase rate of about 1% in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the increasing trend of some components of Mets highlights the urgency of addressing these components as health priorities.","203":"The associations between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases have been intensely studied in recent years. Oxidative stress is involved in the initiation and both progression of periodontitis and atherosclerosis. Antioxidants can reduce the effects of oxidative stress on inflammatory diseases. Our aim was to measure the effects of a grape seed extract (GSE), rich in antioxidants, on atherosclerosis caused by ligature-induced periodontitis in rats. Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups of 10: control group, periodontitis group, and periodontitis group treated with GSE (GSE group). Periodontitis was induced by placing an orthodontic wire around the cervix of the first mandibular molar and keeping it in place for 4 weeks. On days 1, 7 and 28, blood samples were taken to assess oxidative stress and inflammation markers (malondialdehyde and glutathione - MDA, reduced glutathione - GSH, C reactive protein) and lipids. After 4 weeks, the animals were euthanized, and aortas were collected for histopathologic examination. MDA was significantly higher in Periodontitis group compared to the other groups only at day 7. GSH was significantly increased in the Control and GSE groups on days 1 and 7, compared to Periodontitis group and on day 28 higher in GSE vs. Periodontitis groups. C reactive protein was significantly increased in the Periodontitis group on days 1 and 7 compared to both groups. Cholesterol was significantly decreased in the aortas of GSE group at day 28 compared to the Periodontitis group. Oral administration of a grape seed extract reduces the oxidative stress, inflammation and atherosclerosis in a rat model of ligature-induced periodontitis.","204":null,"205":null,"206":"The increase in the number of clinical cases with varying levels of damage to dental structures among young adults due to caries and excessive consumption of sweets and acidic beverages leads to questions about why there is an increase of cases despite all means of information. Is there a lack of interest in oral health among young adults? The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and skills level of the students regarding oral health in order to conceive and implement an oral health educational program adapted to their needs and interests. The survey method using a questionnaire was administered to students in the first, second, and third academic year at the \"Ferdinand I\" Military Technical Academy (Bucharest, Romania) in March 2019 and included general data and specific information about oral health. We noted a relatively high participation in this study (73.91% agreed), although 71% have not participated in campaigns and training programs about oral health. The participants showed a high degree of interest in dental aesthetics, although 59% consider dental caries to be the main problem affecting their oral-dental health. It is imperative to introduce an educational module regarding oral health for military students, and not only, in order to materialize knowledge by adopting healthy attitudes and behaviors, avoiding high financial and biological costs for both the patient and the healthcare system.","207":null,"208":"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common reason for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Also, it is often complicated with fetal distress. Melatonin is widely known as an anti-oxidant agent, and it might decrease the damage of tissues caused by hypoxia. It is also known that levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are changed during pregnancy. Placental growth factor (PlGF) is responsible for the angiogenesis in the placenta. We aimed to investigate whether the level of melatonin, cytokines, and PlGF in umbilical blood after birth is different in the case of IUGR compared to normal fetuses. Fourteen women whose pregnancies were complicated with IUGR were included in the study group. The presence of IUGR was confirmed by ultrasound fetometry in the third pregnancy trimester, 30-36 weeks of gestation. All patients delivered their children vaginally after 37 weeks of pregnancy. The cases of severe fetal distress that required a caesarian section, obstetrical forceps, or vacuum extraction of the fetus were excluded from the study. We found that the concentrations of cytokines did not differ significantly between the groups. Also, no significant difference in the daytime of delivery was found between the groups. The concentrations of melatonin and PlGF in the umbilical blood at labor were significantly lowered in the case of IUGR compared to normal pregnancies. This fact, as we consider, is caused by altered production of melatonin and PlGF by the placenta. Therefore, the protective action of these two factors for the fetus at labor is decreased in IUGR.","209":"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetically determined systemic pathology that involves a disturbance in the synthesis of type one collagen and is mainly characterized by bone brittleness and other abnormalities. The musculoskeletal system is the most affected by bone fracture after mild mechanical stress occurs. Pathologic bowing appears without trauma, and hyperlaxity is jeopardizing joint stability. Having such an abrupt debut, some patients report in-utero fractures, and treatment is very challenging since surgery has to be postponed until the children grow and become good candidates for intramedullary nailing. In this paper, we discuss the experience of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Hospital for Children in treating these patients and the results we obtained regarding the revision surgeries that we had done. Revision surgery is mandatory for OI patients, and there are multiple factors in deciding to use an implant. We looked back at the data collected for those cases where revision was not related to infection, trauma, or disengagement of the male-female system due to the overlengthening of the implant. The conclusions made are comparable to other centers worldwide with respect to lower limb surgery, and we changed the management protocol according to the problems encountered.","210":"The present study aims at predicting preterm delivery by ultrasound measurement of cervical length and the funneling changes of the cervix in preterm labor pregnant women at 28-34 weeks of gestation. The present study is an observational-analytical study with a prospective cohort design. The statistical population of this study includes 70 preterm labor pregnant women who were referred to Tehran hospitals from March 2018 to March 2020. The case group includes 35 women who had short cervical length as well as the funneling changes of the cervix. The control group includes 35 patients whose cervical length was normal and lacked the funneling changes of the cervix. The samples were analyzed after being collected. The mean age of mothers was 29.22 years in the short cervical length group (SD=4.64) and 28.45 years in the normal cervical length group (SD=4.59). The mean length of cervical length was 17.34 mm in the short cervical length group (SD=5.64) and 38.74 mm in the normal cervical length group (SD=4.53). In the case group, the delivery occurred two or seven days after the first visit; as for the proper cervical length group without funneling changes, the delivery occurred 14 days after the first delivery. Thus, the difference is statistically significant (P=0.00). In terms of the preterm delivery before week 34, there was also a significant difference between the short and normal cervical length group, as well as the groups with the funnel-shaped and non-funnel-shaped cervix (P=0.00). However, in terms of post-term delivery before week 37, there was no significant difference between short and normal cervical length groups as well as funneled and non-funneled groups (P=0.78). In terms of term labor, there was a significant difference between short and normal cervical length groups, as well as funneled and non-funneled groups (P=0.00). In investigating the cut-off point with good sensitivity, it was indicated that the cervical length and cervical funneling in pregnant women at risk predict preterm labor before week 34. With the measurement of cervical length and diagnosis of cervical funneling by applying ultrasound, preterm delivery before week 34 can be predicted. Therefore, neonatal mortality and morbidity rates can be reduced in this way.","211":"The importance of kidney damage in obese patients is due to the increasing incidence of nephropathies associated with metabolic disorders, their predisposition to a progressive course of the disease, and the need to optimize early disease detection. The purpose of our work is to study the level of cystatin C, ghrelin, and their interrelation in patients with early stages (I-II) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) against the background of obesity. The indicators of daily microalbuminuria in patients of both groups were studied, and it was found that in patients with stage 2 CKD with obesity, it was 1.2 times higher than in patients with stage 1 CKD with obesity. Patients of the second group revealed a direct middle correlation between daily albuminuria and body mass index (BMI), which indicates deterioration in the functional state of the kidneys against the background of obesity. We obtained an increase in the serum concentration of cystatin C in stage 2 CKD with obesity, reflecting the state of glomerular filtration and the degree of renal function decrease. Correlation analysis showed a positive relation of cystatin C with increased urinary albumin excretion in both groups, plasma creatinine content, BMI, and age. Simultaneously with the increase in the level of cystatin C and the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, there was an increase in ghrelin levels in stage 2 CKD and the progression of obesity, while such dependence was not seen in stage 1 CKD.","212":null,"213":"Low back pain is a common complaint during pregnancy, affecting approximately half of pregnant women. However, true disc herniation is extremely rare, and the majority of patients heal without surgery. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of conservative management strategies and delivery modes for pregnant patients suffering from lumbar disc herniation without severe neurologic deficits that would require emergency surgery. We performed a narrative review of the literature using the PubMed database. Thirty-one articles were originally retrieved, out of which 7 met the inclusion criteria, compiling a total of 10 cases of parturient patients with lumbar disc hernia treated conservatively until childbirth. The preferred delivery mode was a Cesarean section, which was performed in 6 out of 10 cases. Two patients developed the cauda equina syndrome, one during a failed induction and the other patient 4 weeks after vacuum extraction. However, the second patient failed to improve after surgery. No patients developed cauda equina syndrome during or after the Cesarean section. Based on limited data, the Cesarean section seems to be preferred compared to vaginal delivery to avoid worsening symptoms and progression to the cauda equina syndrome.","214":"With regard to the importance of health Information Governance (IG) programs in improving the quality and reducing the cost of healthcare services and the lack of a coherent health IG program in Iran's health system, this study aimed to develop a model for national health information governance program in Iran. The present research was an applied, cross-sectional descriptive study that was done in three steps, including literature review, development of a model for national health IG program in Iran, and model validation. In the third step, we used a questioner to validate the model through the Delphi method. Data analysis was done by descriptive statistics. The model for the national IG program in Iran was developed in 3 main sections consisting of 13 components, 12 principles, natural and judicial authorities of the health IG program, and their job description. Findings from the validation of the initial model showed that most experts (93%) confirmed the components and sub-components, principles, and natural and legal bodies supervising the national health IG program and their job description in the proposed model. Considering the structure of the Iranian health system, it was recommended to establish a health IG council in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in order to develop guidelines and give advice to health care providers. Based on the proposed model, directors and staff of different departments of health care centers, especially those involved in health IG, are also responsible for the better implementation of the national health IG program.","215":"Abuse of legal substances in India includes alcohol and tobacco, which are the major risk factors for various non-communicable diseases and deaths. The current pandemic has identified tobacco consumption as a risk factor for COVID-19, highlighting the need to control substance abuse. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in India and discuss the cost-effective public health strategies (such as yoga) to alleviate COVID-related anxiety in order to prevent substance abuse and its associated co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study reports the data on tobacco and alcohol abuse from a nationwide randomized two-arm diabetes control trial (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata, 2017) conducted by the Indian Yoga Association (IYA) through Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA), Bengaluru. Data of 30,354 participants who abuse tobacco and 30,159 participants who abuse alcohol were collected all over India. The prevalence is estimated at around 8.7% for alcohol abuse and 7.9% for tobacco abuse, Arunachal Pradesh state ranking the highest regarding both alcohol and tobacco abuse, while the Tripura state ranked the lowest. School and college-based mandatory yoga programs need to be implemented to prevent the increase of substance abuse in India to alleviate the psychosocial stress of adolescents and college-going students, besides the installation of the mindfulness-based diabetes yoga protocol (DYP) in the wellness centers of Ayushman Bharat.","216":null,"217":null,"218":"Concerns for successful public health management are integrated into the core business of government-responsible institutions. Diseases associated with metabolic syndrome are very common in the Romanian population. In our study, we focused on the cardiovascular and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The article starts from the hypothesis that the increased incidence of such diseases is determined today by the cumulative effect of traumatic historical events such as the famine of 1946-47 and the communist political regime specific to the 80s and 90s. This study aims to present the arguments that indicate the correlation of economic variables whose variation can be easily determined by traumatic events that affected the economy, with variables able to measure the incidence of various diseases usually associated with metabolic syndrome or NAFLD. A series of statistical data were analyzed from the official sources available in the form of consecutive value data for the 1995-2018 period. The results highlighted a direct and strong link between the variable gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in USD, 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) and specific incidence of circulatory, nutritional endocrine and metabolic diseases, as well as a strong and inverse link between GDP and infant's deaths per 1000 live births. Conclusions highlight that the effects of traumatic historical events must be made aware through medical education of the population, supporting the idea according to which the incidence of various metabolic diseases is greater for the offspring of those who have actively suffered during such events.","219":"Oncology information systems provide solutions for managing the information of cancer patients and enable monitoring of different aspects of cancer patient care. Since the use of oncology information systems enhances the quality of care, improves documentation, optimizes resource allocation, and increases the cost-effectiveness of care services, attention to these systems' performance and their adaptation to workflows seems necessary. The purpose of this study was to identify cancer patient care workflows to design an oncology information system for Iran. This study employed a qualitative design and was conducted in 2019. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 experts to determine their views on identifying workflows for cancer patients' care. The participants were clinical and non-clinical staff at six university hospitals equipped with oncology wards. The method of data analysis was framework analysis. The cancer patient care workflows consisted of two categories, including cancer diagnosis workflows and cancer treatment workflows. Cancer diagnosis workflows fall into three subcategories, i.e., the patient's referral to the clinic, an examination of the patient's condition, and pathology workflows. On the other hand, cancer treatment workflows are divided into various treatments offered to cancer patients and workflows in the chemotherapy and radiotherapy wards. Given the variety of services and the complexity of caring for cancer patients as well as the involvement of various specialists in the process of care, identifying and optimizing workflows in the oncology information system reduces errors, enhances data accuracy, eliminates unnecessary steps, and ultimately improve the service delivery to cancer patients.","220":"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a type of inflammatory condition that includes a group of symptoms, mainly affecting the nasal mucosa. Nasal obstruction, sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, in addition to swollen, itchy, red and watery eyes are the most common symptoms of the disease. These symptoms are triggered as a result of increased inflammatory mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. Studies have recently shown the role of vitamin D (vit.D) in many allergic and immune conditions, where receptors for the active form of vit.D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) have been discovered on the surface of almost all types of inflammatory cells. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore the level of vit. D in AR patients and its correlation with the severity of the disease. Two groups participated in the study; the first group included 49 patients who were diagnosed in a private otolaryngology clinic by the first author as having allergic rhinitis (AR group). The second one served as a control group and included 50 apparently healthy volunteers with no history of AR. The mean level of IgE and vit. D was found to be 326.3 and 10.2 ng\/ml in the AR group, respectively, and 30.8 and 23.3 ng\/ml in the control group, respectively. Ninety-three percent of AR patients have shown a deficiency in vit. D level, where 56% of this group showed severe deficiency. On the other hand, 34% of the control group has shown an insufficient level of vit. D. Additionally, 64% of AR patients have shown serum levels of IgE at values ranging between 100-299 ng\/ml. Higher serum levels of IgE at values ranging between 300-599 ng\/ml and 600-1000 ng\/ml were observed in 25% and 11% of AR patients, respectively. The prevalence of low levels of vit. D in the AR group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Vit. D deficiency is significantly related to severe AR symptoms and measuring serum vit. D level is recommended in the management plan of this group of patients.","221":"Facial disfigurement due to trauma is very common as the face is a prominent part of the body and is susceptible to injuries. A protocol for the diagnosis and intervention for psychological problems of trauma patients should be implemented in the Indian hospitals as they lack policies for assessing the mental status of such patients. This study was conducted to analyze and determine the psychological implications and need for mental health services of maxillofacial trauma patients. Fifty patients with maxillofacial trauma above 18 years of age were included in this study. The assessment was done using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ), which are considered as the standard tools for assessment of psychological disorders post-trauma. We observed psychological stress in 84% of the patients at the baseline, which reduced to 24% after one month at the first follow-up visit and further reduced to 22% at the second follow-up visit. The reduction in the percentage from the first to the second follow-up visit was less significant. However, the change in HADS and TSQ scores was found to be significant, suggesting that the intensity of trauma decreases with the time-lapse. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress are prevalent in patients with maxillofacial trauma, which may lead to impaired day-to-day life. Our results suggest that there is a need for psychological care in patients with maxillofacial trauma.","222":"The impact of climate change on humanity and nature is increasingly evident. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, leading to rising sea levels, a sharp drop in Arctic sea ice, floods, heatwaves, and fires. Calls to action are getting stronger. Concerns about climate change have become a full social movement, stimulating climate activism from the bottom up to the world, especially among young people. Campaigns are initiated by governments and international organizations, scientists and scientific institutions, organizations, groups, and people in civil society, public intellectuals and political, religious leaders, people of culture and entertainment. These campaigns generally aim to inform, raise awareness and shape public understanding about the science, problems, and policy of climate change, with the hope that, first of all, people will change their attitudes and behavior, and secondly, will mobilize to put pressure on policymakers for effective climate policies.","223":"TBS (Trabecular Bone Score) is the latest tool for clinicians to evaluate bone micro-architecture based on a pixel greyscale, which is provided by lumbar dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Its use enhances fracture prediction in addition to DXA-BMD (Bone Mineral Density). This is independent of fracture risk assessment (FRAX) and DXA results. We present a narrative review regarding the connection between TBS and Glucocorticoids (GC), either as a drug used for different conditions or as a tumor-produced endogenous excess. TBS is a better discriminator for GC-induced vertebral fractures compared to DXA-BMD. This aspect is similarly available for patients with osteoporosis diagnosed by DXA. TBS is inversely correlated with the cumulative dose of GC (systemic or inhaled), with disease duration, and positively correlated with respiratory function in patients with asthma. Low TBS values are found in females with a T-score at the hip within the osteoporosis range, with diabetes mellitus, or who use GC. Lumbar TBS is a screening tool in menopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TBS is an independent parameter that provides information regarding skeleton deterioration in diabetic patients receiving GC therapy in a manner complementary to DXA-BMD. TBS might become an essential step regarding the adrenalectomy decision in patients with adrenal incidentaloma in whom autonomous cortisol secretion might damage bone micro-architecture. TBS currently represents a standard tool of fracture risk evaluation in patients receiving GC therapy or with endogenous Cushing's syndrome, a tool easy to be applied by different practitioners since GCs are largely used.","224":"Reflux disease continues to be one of the most common pathologies in the world. There is much discussion regarding the mechanism of developing and the variety of possible symptoms. In recent years, the use of new technologies, like high-resolution manometry and pH impedance, brought new insights into this disease. Also, there are emerging therapies that are covering the gap between the patients treated with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and those who benefit the most from laparoscopic treatment (hiatal hernia, complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Also, most of them are less invasive than a laparoscopic fundoplication. We present a short review of the treatment options in patients who need more than lifestyle changes and PPI therapy.","225":"","226":"Epignathus is a rare congenital orofacial teratoma. Teratomas are tumors that originate from all three germs cell layers. Tumor size is an important prognostic factor, and we describe the case of massive epignathus identified by sonography at 25 weeks. Our case was a 35-year-old pregnant woman that was subjected to a routine ultrasound at 25 weeks of gestation, and epignathus was diagnosed. Labor pain started in the 28th week of the pregnancy, so the dead fetus was aborted, and curettage was conducted. A pathologic sample was sent to the laboratory, and benign teratoma was diagnosed. Because fetal epignathus has a wide range of outcomes, early prenatal diagnosis is essential for optimal management.","227":"This study aimed to compare Miller and Macintosh laryngoscopes in zero to 4-year-old children. A total of 72 children with a score of I and II, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, who were candidates for elective surgery with general anesthesia and tracheal intubation were enrolled in the study. The children were divided into two equal groups (36 persons) according to used laryngoscope: Miller laryngoscope (group 1) and Macintosh laryngoscope (group 2). Observations and all laryngoscopies were performed by a single experienced anesthesiologist. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and hemoglobin saturation were measured and recorded. The number of endotracheal intubation attempts and complications were also recorded for both groups. In terms of gender, the first group consisted of 88.9% boys and 11.1% girls, and the second group consisted of 66.6% boys and 33.3% girls (p-value=0.05). The mean age was 16.7 months in the first group and 17.7 months in the second group (p-value=0.5). The mean weight of the children was 16988.5 g and 16300 g in the Miller and Macintosh groups, respectively (p-value=0.9). Regarding the Cormack-Lehane classification system, 5 patients were classified as grade 1 (13.9%), 14 patients as grade 2 (38.9%), 15 patients as grade 3 (41.7%), and 2 patients as grade 4 (5.6%) in the Macintosh group. In contrast, in the Miller group, 5 patients were classified as grade 1 (13.9%), 27 patients as grade 2 (75%), and 4 patients as grade 3 (11.1%) (p-value=0.004). These results can provide more data about the tracheal intubation method with the Macintosh and Miller laryngoscopes, the ease of intubation, and the best laryngoscopic view with each blade.","228":null,"229":null,"230":"Risk assessment is an essential component of the occupational health and safety event prevention activity.The purpose of this study is to choose the most appropriate risk assessment method for hospitals. The main methods were compared. There are many assessment methods, each with its advantages and disadvantages, but none has been adapted to the specificities of hospital activity. We adapted the workplace assessment sheet from the INCDPM (National Research and Development Institute for Labor Protection Bucharest) method to the specific of the hospital units and used this method at the level of jobs, within the hospital's departments, calculating the global risk level per job position, workplace (department), and hospital.

In a quasi-experiment, convenience sampling was employed to select 61 biochemistry students, who were then randomly divided into three groups. The experimental groups were trained separately using the cooperative flipped learning and individual flipped learning methods in seven sessions. The control group was trained using the conventional method. The groups were given teacher-made academic achievement tests, used as pretest and posttest. The ANCOVA test was employed to analyze data. According to the results, the cooperative flipped learning method improved academic performance more than the individual flipped learning method in the posttest scores. The results also indicated that the flipped learning implementation both outside and inside the classroom has effects on learning. In fact, the optimal implementation of flipped learning improves in-depth learning to solve problems and carry out experiments in a biochemistry course.","233":"This study aims to analyze the performance of rotary root canal preparation, conducted by beginner operators (students). After acquiring the necessary skills involved in applying endodontic preparation techniques on extracted teeth, all students from a cohort learned to use ProTaper Universal files (Dentsply Maillefer). The preclinical training had several stages. Experience 1: instrumentation on extracted single-root teeth; Experience 2: instrumentation on EndoTraining blocks (Dentsply Maillefer); Experience 3: instrumentation on EndoTraining blocks (Dia Dent Group International); Experience 4: Instrumentation on extracted multiradicular teeth. Preparation was done according to the manufacturer's instructions, the initial file is Sx, followed by S1, S2, F1, F2 and the last file is F3. A batch of 50 teeth (E1, E2, E3, E4) was randomly selected to evaluate the onset of the rotary preparation of young operators. Two independent evaluators analyzed the array radiologically by stereomicroscope evaluation (E1, E4) and photo-analysis of the resulting Endo Training blocks (E2, E3). The success rate was 80% for E1, 72% for E2, 64% for E3 and 76% for E4 (p&lt;0.05). The following were considered a failure: ledge formation and apical transportation in 10.66%, over instrumentation in 6.66%, zipping in 3.33%, and instrument fracture in 4% of cases. Endodontic instrumentation techniques require training to acquire the necessary skills. Rotary root canal instrumentation techniques used almost exclusively in modern endodontics require adequate preclinical training.","234":"Properly diagnosed tumor-like formations of the ovaries facilitate the correct selection of patients who may not require surgery, or choose surgery with minimal access if such intervention is required. Subjective assessment of the features of tumor-like formations with the help of ultrasound diagnostics, including compression elastography, proved to be highly effective in the differential diagnosis of bulky ovarian formations. All tumor-like formations have their sonographic features that allow making a reliable diagnosis of a particular formation. The article reveals data on the diagnostic significance of multiparametric ultrasound imaging in the detection of ovarian tumor-like formations. A detailed sonographic picture of tumor-like formations in B-mode, color, and pulse Doppler mode and compression sonoelastography mode was analyzed. This examination was especially relevant for women of reproductive age, as it depended on the further tactics of treatment of each patient. For all types of tumor-like formations ovaries, a qualitative feature was determined - elastotype on the Ueno scale and the index of stiffness (Strain Ratio) - a quantitative indicator. Follicular cysts, endometrioid and periovarian cysts were found to belong to the 0 elastotype. Cysts of the corpus luteum belonged to the II elastotype on the Ueno scale. The lowest values of the stiffness index were seen in follicular and periovarian cysts, and the highest value was observed in endometrioid cysts. Our results have shown that ultrasound examination of ovarian tumors is an accurate and highly informative method.","235":"By changing the lifestyle and increasing the cancer incidence, accurate diagnosis becomes a significant medical action. Today, DNA microarray is widely used in cancer diagnosis and screening since it is able to measure gene expression levels. Analyzing them by using common statistical methods is not suitable because of the high gene expression data dimensions. So, this study aims to use new techniques to diagnose acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, the leukemia microarray gene data, contenting 22283 genes, was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository. Initial preprocessing was applied by using a normalization test and principal component analysis in Python. Then DNNs neural network designed and implemented to the data and finally results cross-validated by classifiers. The normalization test was significant (P&gt;0.05) and the results show the PCA gene segregation potential and independence of cancer and healthy cells. The results accuracy for single-layer neural network and DNNs deep learning network with three hidden layers are 63.33 and 96.67, respectively. Using new methods such as deep learning can improve diagnosis accuracy and performance compared to the old methods. It is recommended to use these methods in cancer diagnosis and effective gene selection in various types of cancer.","236":"Although benefiting from an unprecedented technological evolution, contemporary endodontics is still characterized by the recurrence of retreatments, due to the need to solve quite frequent incidents, accidents, or even failures of primary endodontic treatment. This survey aims to assess both the etiology and the prevention methods of one of the most troublesome endodontic iatrogenies: instrument separation during root canal shaping. The multifactorial nature of this occurrence entails identifying and taking into account all the causal and contributing factors. Their significant number and the possible involvement of any of them, starting with the complexity and variability of the root canals and ending with the technical specifications concerning the nickel-titanium rotary instrumentation system being used, highlight the necessity to develop valid guidelines to avert the occurring of such an upsetting situation.","237":"The study of the incidence of cryoglobulinemia is relevant in patients with an intestinal anastomotic leak. This study aims to determine a laboratory marker of the risk of small intestine anastomotic leak. The study was based on 96 patients who were subjected to resections of segments of the small intestine with the formation of intestinal anastomoses at the State Institution \"Zaytsev V.T. Institute of General and Urgent Surgery of National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine\". Of all the operated patients, there were 55.2% women and 44.8% men. Of the 96 patients examined, cryoglobulinemia was detected in the majority - 62.5% of patients, of which 4 were later proved to have inactive hepatitis C; the remaining 38.5% had no cryoglobulinemia. According to the existing theory of the autoimmune mechanism of postoperative surgical complications formation, the revealed decrease in the level of cryoglobulins on the second day could be related to their fixation in the microcirculatory bed and the development of immunocomplex inflammation. While the increase in the content of cryoglobulins in serum on the third day can be caused by their entry into the circulatory bed from deposition or fixation sites and the development of a secondary immune response. In patients with intestinal anastomosis failure after resection of intestinal segments, cryoglobulinemia rates increased more than 80 mg\/l; this indicator could be used as a marker of postoperative complications.","238":null,"239":"Flatfoot is a common deformity in the pediatric population and has a multitude of causes. Sometimes, it can be a normal finding in children, and treatment should not be guided only based on the appearance, but rather after thoroughly assessing the patient and the impact it has on the child's daily life. In this paper, we describe the quality of life that the patients are experiencing after the surgical treatment of this pathology. We made a comparison between the most used techniques for correcting flatfoot and insisted on the postoperative comfort of the patient, rehabilitation, and the time it took to get back to their daily routine. The comparison was made between Mosca calcaneal lengthening osteotomy, Grice extraarticular arthrodesis, arthroereisis and triple arthrodesis of the foot. All of the surgeries were performed by the same doctor at \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Emergency Hospital for Children in Bucharest. From the data collected, we propose that newer, minimally invasive techniques could be used in treating this pathology in order to help the patient feel better in the postoperative period and avoid some of the complications regularly encountered when using the old techniques.","240":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a multifactorial disease characterized by gene-gene interaction as well as environmental effects. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is proved to be higher in the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than in the case of its absence. We aimed to study the genotypes of MDR1 (C3435T) gene polymorphism and its relationship with clinical, instrumental, and laboratory parameters in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. All the patients were divided into two groups. The first group included 53 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the second group included 49 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus. The COPD assessment test (CAT), 6-minute walk test, BODE integral index, spirometry, and bioimpedansometry were used for examination. Lipid spectrum, carbohydrate metabolism, endothelial functional status, leptin, adiponectin, and serum levels were also determined by means of enzyme immunoassay. Our study results showed no significant difference between the genotypes of the control group of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus. Though, a certain association of this gene polymorphism with clinical findings by CAT-test, specific parameters of carbohydrate (fasting glucose) and lipid metabolism (total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol lipoproteins), endothelial functional state (nitrate\/nitrite level) with the minor allele T available was found.","241":"Surgery site infection is one of the most common postoperative complications which is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and admission costs. It is considered a priority to determine the level of nosocomial infection and its control in reflecting the quality of care. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the microbial contamination after cardiac surgery at a hospital cardiac surgery ward of Besat Hospital, Tehran. In this cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study (2013-2017), 610 patients underwent surgery at the Department of Cardiac Surgery of Besat Hospital. All necessary information such as urine culture, surgical site, histopathologic examination for the diagnosis of microbial contamination and microorganisms were collected from the patient records and inserted in the questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 25). The incidence of nosocomial infections following cardiac surgery reportedly ranged from 17% to 23%. Accordingly, pneumonia (51.2%) and local infections (22%) were the most common infections in the studied population. The mortality rate in our population was 11.4%. Moreover, 64.3% of the total mortality cases were reported in patients with sepsis. The mean age and duration of admission of patients with catheter infection were significantly higher than other subjects. Given the relatively high prevalence of the infection and its importance, it is necessary to take more serious measures to prevent and control these infections.","242":"Implant-prosthetic rehabilitation registers multiple variants, but their short- and long-term evolution has been a frequent concern. This study aimed to evaluate the peri-implant bone resorption at the level of the tilted implants in the SKY fast &amp; fixed restorations, with reference to clinical and treatment parameters. An observational study was conducted on a convenience sample of patients with implant-prosthetic rehabilitation in one or both jaws, according to the SKY fast &amp; fixed protocol (Bredent, Germany). Bone resorption was assessed on panoramic radiography. Other data were collected from the patient's medical records. Thirty tilted implants were analyzed, 12 of which were in the maxilla and 18 in the mandible. After the follow-up period, both bone resorption (maximum 7 mm) and bone apposition (maximum 8 mm) were observed. There was a tendency for the resorption to be more pronounced in the mandible, in patients where tooth loss was due to periodontal disease, and when implants with length less than 16 mm were used. Resorption was statistically significantly lower when bone addition materials and membranes were used at the extraction socket, and when SKY fast &amp; fixed rehabilitation was performed in both jaws. SKY fast &amp; fixed implant-prosthetic technique, which involves applying a small number of implants, and a fixed prosthesis corresponding to a shortened dental arch, is a viable method of treatment that outcomes the need for complex and expensive surgical interventions, and proves to be beneficial in maintaining the optimal parameters of bone support.","243":null,"244":"Dental health plays an imperative role in the general health and well-being of an individual. Terminally ill patients due to a compromised immune response are susceptible to a wide array of oral complications, which may affect their ability to speak and chew, leading to malnutrition.

However, TBI patients have a high risk of developing long-term complications such as physical disability, cognitive impairment, psychiatric pathology, epilepsy, and others. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between protein biomarkers S100 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neurocognitive status at 10- and 90-days post-injury. Both biomarkers were tested in the first 4h and after 72h post-injury in 62 patients with moderate-severe TBI. The patients were evaluated by a series of neurocognitive tests: Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index (ERBI), Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Processing Speed Index (PSI), and Stroop Test, at 10 and 90 days post-injury and supplementary by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 90 days. For evaluating the whole neurocognitive status instead of every scale separately, we used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), while for anxiety and depressive symptoms, we used multiple regression analyses. SEM showed that NSE values at 4 hours were significant predictors of the cognitive status at 10 (p=0.034) and 90 days (p= 0.023). Also, there were found significant correlations between NSE at 4h and the anxiety level. This study demonstrated a significant correlation between NSE at 4h and short and medium-term neuropsychological outcomes, which recommends using this biomarker for selecting patients with a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction.","247":"Cyprus has been affected by COVID-19 since March 2019. With a case fatality rate of 2.6% (until June 2020) and the social isolation measures enforced on the population, the population's mental health has been affected. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of the Cypriot population during the outbreak and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 216 volunteers regarding demographic data, COVID-19-related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and major depressive symptoms. The overall prevalence of GAD and major depressive symptoms of the public were 13.89% and 8.33%, respectively. No demographic had shown any statistical significance with GAD. The younger age group of the study showed a statistically significant association with major depressive symptoms when compared to the adult population in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Our study identified a mental health burden of the Cypriot population, especially the younger age groups. As part of the preparedness for situations as the one we are experiencing and the future impact the pandemic may have on society, interventions should be focused on vulnerable groups of the population to alleviate the psychosocial effects.","248":"Diabetes is a significant public health problem and one of the causes of death and disability globally. One of the main problems with diabetes control is the lack of adherence to therapeutic regimens in people with diabetes. This study investigates the experiences and views of the Iranian people with diabetes to identify the challenges of the process of adherence to treatment. A grounded theory research design was used, incorporating in-depth interviews to collect the data. Using purposeful sampling, 28 people with type 2 diabetes (9 men, 19 women) from different places were included in the study. Constant comparative analysis was undertaken to identify key categories. The main challenge in this process is losing the golden time of preventing the complications of the disease that occurs for the following reasons: cultural habits and values, religious beliefs (believing diabetes was God's will), resistance to change due to age, job conditions, lack of harmony in the family, and non-shared decision-making in the health system. People with diabetes go through trial and error in order to achieve awareness and insight, and consequently, adherence to treatment. Therefore, they need help and support to achieve insight and adherence to treatment faster and without complications. In fact, if the care plan is designed to encourage active patient participation by the treatment team in the shortest possible time, the time to achieve compliance will be shorter and will have the least side effects for these people.","249":null,"250":"Cognitive dysfunction is a significant complaint among patients after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), with devastating consequences on functional recovery and quality of life. Prognostic models allow a better assessment and management of neurotrauma patients. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the predictive value of the Baseline Prognostic Risk Score (BPRS) in moderate to severe TBI, in a sample of patients treated with neurotrophic factors. Eighty patients with moderate-severe TBI from the CAPTAIN II study were included in secondary data analysis. Patients received active treatment with Cerebrolysin, 50 mL per day for ten days, followed by two treatment cycles with 10 mL per day for ten days. BPRS was determined on admission; the age was recorded, and patients were evaluated using the following neurocognitive tests: Mini-Mental State Essay (MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition Processing Speed Index (WAIS-III PSI) and Stroop Colour Word Test-Victoria Version at 10, 30 and 90 days. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to investigate the unique predictive value of BPRS on cognitive evolution, independent of age. BPRS independently predicted scores on the WAIS-III PSI DSCales and the Word subscale of the Stroop Colour Word Test at 90 days. Age was a significant predictor for all the investigated scales at 10, 30, and 90 days. This study demonstrates the predictive value of a validated prognostic model (BPRS) for medium-term neurocognitive outcomes in a sample of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury treated with neurotrophic factors.","251":"In the last 200 years, the action of the highly diluted homeopathic remedies has been proved by their curative effect on the human organism. In this work, a hypothesis concerning the mystifying question about this action is proposed. The hypothesis suggests that any pathology, either functional or structural, can be detected in the change of the overall energy of the human body. Such energy is constituted by fields of force according to quantum physics. More precisely, every disturbance of the human organism affects the spin on electrons of different elements within the human body, and their reset could take place with an agent similar to the electromagnetic force that created the problem. This statement has been proved by the correct homeopathic treatments, as it can be seen in many published cases. The hypothesis is based on two approaches, the idea of the spin of electrons and the vital force, and their scientific relevance.","252":"The article presents data on a new scheme of complex treatment and rehabilitation of emigrants with psychogenic, endogenous and organic depressive disorders, as well as the results of comparative analysis of the effectiveness of this scheme, compared to the traditional one.

Our objective was to study and compare the impact of early childhood caries on the quality of life of preschool children aged 22-70 months and their caregivers in an urban and rural population using the early childhood oral health impact scale. The study was conducted on children of the Rangareddy district, Telangana state, aged between 22 -70 months affected by early childhood caries and their parents\/guardians. The subjects were given a questionnaire to measure the early childhood oral health impact scale, and the filled questionnaires were analyzed and tabulated. The mean early childhood oral health impact scale and domain scores for the rural population were significantly higher than that of the urban population signifying a more mediocre quality of life. There was a weak positive and insignificant relationship between early childhood caries and the early childhood oral health impact scale in the rural population, whereas there was a moderately strong, significant positive relationship between the two in the urban population. Oral health-related quality of life of young children enables parents and caregivers to implement positive dental care practices.","257":"Cell culture is one of the most commonly used techniques in the production of biological products. Many physical and chemical parameters may affect cell growth and proliferation. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of chemical components as supplements using the experimental design method, which aimed at reducing the number of experiments. For this purpose, supplements including chemical components using four levels, with three replications in suspension and batch culture conditions, were examined for 72 hours using the Taguchi experimental design method. From the experiments, it was concluded that the culture media composition had a significant impact on final cell count and pH. High concentrations of different media composition alone were insufficient to ensure higher cell count. According to the results, this insufficiency was associated with an increase of 20% in the number of final cells. In the majority of cultures, the number of final cells at 48 hours increased relative to the number of final cells at 24 hours after culturing the cells.","258":null,"259":"Environmental tobacco smoke, containing many toxic gases, suggests inevitable contact of humans with the damaging factors of cigarettes. On average, approximately 40% of children, 35% of women and 32% of men worldwide are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. This study aims at investigating the relationship between environmental tobacco smoke in adolescents and their educational self-regulation and achievement. In this study, 770 students aged between 13 and 15 were selected and studied using the multistage sampling method. The tools used in this study consisted of four questionnaires, demographic characteristics, environmental tobacco smoke, educational self-regulation, and educational achievement.

These findings suggest that Angiotensin II has nonhemodynamic effects in progressive renal disease. The renin-angiotensin system is now recognized to be linked to the induction of plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1, possibly via the AT4 receptor, thus promoting both thrombosis and fibrosis. Interactions of the renin-angiotensin system with aldosterone and bradykinin may impact both blood pressure and tissue injury. The beneficial effect on renal fibrosis of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system likely reflects the central role that angiotensin has in regulating renal function and structure by its various actions. This article explores the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 interaction and the potential significance of these interactions in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease and remodeling of renal sclerosis.","281":"","282":"Article J Med Life 2019; 12(2): 192-193; doi: 10.25122\/jml-2019-0057 has been retracted for legal reasons.","283":"The management and prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma largely depend on its invasiveness and grade of differentiation. Pigmented nail fold squamous cell carcinoma represents a therapeutic challenge, needing careful treatment to preserve nail function. Here, we report the use of dermoscopy and Reflectance Confocal Microscopy to monitor nail fold squamous cell carcinoma in situ and its response to treatment with topical imiquimod.","284":"Children suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss may benefit from a bone-anchored hearing aid system (BAHA Attract implantable prosthesis). After audiological rehabilitation, different aspects of development are improving. The objective of this case report is to propose a comprehensive framework for monitoring cortical auditory function after implantation of a bone-anchored hearing aid system by using electrophysiological and neuropsychological measurements. We present the case of a seven-year-old boy with a congenital hearing loss due to a plurimalformative syndrome, including outer and middle ear malformation. After the diagnosis of hearing loss and the audiological rehabilitation with a BAHA Attract implantable prosthesis, the cortical auditory evoked potentials were recorded. We performed a neuropsychological evaluation using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition, which was applied according to a standard procedure. The P1 latency was delayed according to the age (an objective biomarker for quantifying cortical auditory function). The neuropsychological evaluation revealed that the child's working memory and verbal reasoning abilities were in the borderline range comparing with his nonverbal reasoning abilities and processing abilities, which were in the average and below-average range, respectively. Cortical auditory evoked potentials, along with neuropsychological evaluation, could be an essential tool for monitoring cortical auditory function in children with hearing loss after a bone-anchored hearing aid implantation.","285":"Here we present a case of a 70-year-old man with acute myocardial infarction caused by left anterior descending artery occlusion presenting as ST elevation in the inferior leads that suggested an occlusion of the right coronary artery. In contrast, coronary angiography results indicated a complete occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. We reported our observation in electrocardiographic data and coronary angiography and its changes after a percutaneous coronary intervention, and then we discuss its pathophysiologic mechanism.","286":"Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can have severe toxicities, which include CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). The patient may present with altered mental status, encephalopathy, seizures, and cerebral edema. Depending on the severity, the recovery process will require rehabilitation. We present a case and explain how communication between cancer physiatrists, oncologists, and patients can affect the expectations for functional recovery, and the importance of setting goals for recovery in a medically complex population. We present a patient who underwent aggressive chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, causing encephalopathy and complications. He initially required total assistance for mobility and activities of daily living. Physiatry was consulted to assist with the rehabilitation plan of care and disposition. Initially, the oncologist conveyed to the patient he would be walking in two weeks, which was unrealistically optimistic. The patient's physiatrist intervened and discussed these expectations with him, alleviating his emotional distress. His condition improved with inpatient rehabilitation, and he was able to ambulate short distances with modified independence in four weeks. The involvement of a cancer physiatrist allows for recognition and treatment of complications related to cancer and aggressive therapies, along with an accurate functional prognosis assessment. With improved communication and patient involvement, the patient underwent a successful rehabilitation.","287":"Nurses may be anxious due to critical and emergencies, and anxiety can affect their professional performance. Non-pharmacological interventions, as a safe method, can reduce anxiety. This study aimed to determine the effect of music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile - lavender essential oil on the anxiety of clinical nurses. This was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. One hundred twenty nurses from clinical wards of Besat Hospital in Sanandaj, Iran, were selected between 2018 and 2019 by purposeful sampling. The samples were randomly assigned to three groups with different interventions, namely music therapy, both aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil and music therapy, and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil, along with a control group as well. The anxiety of nurses was measured based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory before the intervention and after three work shifts. The data were analyzed using the SPSS v.22 software. One-way ANOVA was used to test the hypotheses. The findings showed that the mean scores of the anxiety of nurses after the intervention in the three groups namely the group for which music therapy was applied, the group for which aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil was used and the group for which both music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil were applied, were (39.28), (37.82) and (40.03), respectively. Therefore, the obtained mean score of each group was significantly lower than that of the control group (56.08) (p &lt; 0.0001). The results showed that the interventions of music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil could reduce the anxiety of nurses. Therefore, it is recommended to use music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil to reduce the anxiety of nurses in the clinical setting.","288":"The demographic statistics indicate that, with the industrial development and the advances in the medical field, the average life of the population has started to increase significantly; consequently, the needs of treatments in geriatric dentistry are becoming more and more significant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients' perception of diverse techniques used to obtain previews for final fixed prosthetic restorations: digital smile design (DSD), wax-up, indirect mock-up, temporary restorations, Computer-Aided Design (CAD). A focus group that included 11 participants, all of them geriatric patients, was formed; patients were invited to respond to a set of seven questions before and after various previsualization methods were applied. The focus-group report indicated that the indirect mock-up and the temporary restorations were considered by the geriatric patients as the best methods for obtaining good prosthetic previews. Comparing to the other tested methods, the use of indirect mock-up increased the acceptance of the prosthetic treatment plan and offered the most influential visual impact for 72.7% of participants. In addition, all tested previews allowed excellent communication with patients, the best results being obtained with the temporary prosthetic restorations (for 54.5% of participants). This approach represented a tool for better decisions regarding final dental restoration and has had a positive influence on patients' acceptance of the treatment plan as well, making the final restoration more predictable.","289":"Gonorrhea is the second most common sexually transmitted infection spreading worldwide and a serious public health problem. However, further data are required to improve the management of gonorrhea. Our aim was to review the features of gonococcal infection and characterize the challenges of its management. A retrospective descriptive study of the medical records of 136 adult patients with gonorrhea that visited Ternopil Regional Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinic (Ukraine) in 2013-2018 was performed. The male-to-female ratio was 6.6:1. Homosexually-acquired gonorrhoea was 3.7%. Also, most patients acquired gonorrhea in Ukraine (98.4%). The mean infectious period lasted 2-16 days, including the incubation period of 1-9 days and the period from the onset of symptoms to the first visit of the clinic of 1-7 days. The probability of N. gonorrhoeae transmission within the frame of the epidemiologic sexual chain was 1:2.4. Concurrent T. vaginalis (39.7%) and C. trachomatis (2.2%) were detected. HIV and syphilis screening rates were 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively. The examining rate of sexual partners was 11%, testing extragenital specimens - 0.7%, screening coverage for HIV - 46.3%, compliance with follow-up visits - 41.9%. Part of patients (16.2%) received monotherapy with clarithromycin, doxycycline, benzylpenicillin, azithromycin, or ofloxacin. The management of N. gonorrhoeae infections was compromised by a low rate of examining sexual partners, females and testing extragenital specimens, screening for HIV, compliance to follow-up visits, access to nucleic acid amplification tests, and receiving questionable or even obsolete antimicrobial treatment. Therefore, more accurate and comprehensive management of gonorrhea is urgently needed in Ukraine.","290":null,"291":"Migraine pathophysiology and sleep share common neural pathways, and there are clinical as well as paraclinical observations, which lead to the hypothesis of an association between migraine and sleep disorders. The objective of this study consisted of the evaluation of a possible correlation between migraine and sleep disorders in children, as reflected by sleep architecture and electroencephalographic patterns. Eighteen patients aged five to seventeen were recruited for the migraine group, and sixteen age-matched patients with no criteria for migraine or any underlying organic disorder, diagnosed with emotional disorders, were enrolled in the control group. All patients underwent inpatient full night polysomnographic recordings, the results of which were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Patients in the migraine group had decreased REM sleep (p = 0.049) and increased N1 sleep (p = 0.018) percentages, compared to the control group. Also, more arousals (p = 0.011) and lower sleep latency (p = 0.029) were noted in the migraine group. A statistically significant association was observed between migraine and sleep disorders when the latter was defined with respect to normal values of polysomnographic parameters published in studies conducted on healthy children. Polysomnography can be a useful tool for studying sleep in pediatric migraine patients. The results of this study can be regarded as a starting point for a better understanding of the complex role of sleep in the developing brain and of eventual intricacies with migraine pathophysiological mechanisms.","292":"Our aim was to evaluate the location of impacted canines and their proximity to the lateral and central incisor to assess the prognosis of the impacted canine and compare the reliability of 2D versus 3D imaging solutions. We carried a prospective study on 17 subjects with impacted maxillary canines. Later, the patients underwent radiologic examination, i.e., sectional computed tomography and orthopantomography. The obtained records were compared regarding the location of the impacted maxillary canine, the proximity and resorption of the impacted canine to the lateral and central incisors, the prognosis of the impacted canine, and the linear distance of the canine from the vertical and horizontal reference lines drawn. Eleven males (45.8%) and 13 females (54.1%), 11 (45.8%) impacted canines on the right side, and 13 (54.1%) on the left side, as well as 2 (8.3%) transpositions, were noted. Buccally impacted teeth caused less resorption of the adjacent teeth. Among the 24 teeth examined using orthopantomography with the sector method, 3 (12.5%) teeth were found in sector 1. There were 8 (33.33%) teeth in sector 2, and 11 (45.8%) of the impacted canines were in sector 3. In localizing impacted maxillary canines, computed tomography revealed an increased accuracy of 31% compared to orthopantomography. Even though both computed tomography and orthopantomography revealed similar records, computed tomography showed more accuracy, also having an added advantage of its 3D viewing capabilities in precise localization of the impacted maxillary canine.","293":null,"294":null,"295":null,"296":null,"297":"In surgical practice, surgeons request CT scans to rule out acute appendicitis, even in young patients. We aimed to assess the feasibility of using a CT scan to reduce the rate of negative laparoscopies in patients younger than 40 with equivocal signs of acute appendicitis. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective observational study on the patients admitted with a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Patients younger than 40 and with the Alvarado score between 3 and 6 were included. These were divided into two groups: those who had or did not have a CT scan. Each group was further subdivided into patients that had a laparoscopy and those that did not. Out of 204 patients included in the study, 16% were included in the CT group, and 84% in the non-CT group. 71.9% of the patients that underwent a CT scan had appendicitis and underwent an appendectomy. Five patients with a normal CT scan had appendectomy due to persistent signs of acute appendicitis. The histopathology of the 23 patients with positive CT was positive, and 3 of the 5 patients with negative CT that underwent appendectomy had positive histology results. The negative appendectomy rate for patients that had preoperative CT is 7.14% compared to 32.4% in patients without preoperative CT. The rate of negative laparoscopy in patients younger than 40 years old that undergo preoperative CT is significantly lower with a p-value of .00667.","298":null,"299":"The frequency of legislation changes and their utility is a subject of interest and always under debate with pro and contra arguments. In the current study, the perception of students regarding medical legislation changes was analyzed. In general, no statistically significant differences were found between the sub-groups of students, thus underlining a unitary perception. The general perception is that changes in legislation are made too often. Moreover, only a small part of the analyzed group agrees on the utility of these changes. Finally, it seems that income is the main driver for students as future employees in the medical system. Also, significant differences between males and females' perceptions are emphasized, and legislation changes should take into account the primary drivers. Other issues, such as corruption, stability, and performances should be the key points in legislation changes. These results should be a challenge for all stakeholders, in particular for policymakers.","300":"Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) is a modern type of electroencephalography (EEG) analysis that involves recording digital EEG signals which are processed, transformed, and analyzed using complex mathematical algorithms. QEEG has brought new techniques of EEG signals feature extraction: analysis of specific frequency band and signal complexity, analysis of connectivity, and network analysis. The clinical application of QEEG is extensive, including neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, traumatic brain injury, mental health disorders, and many others. In this review, we talk through existing evidence on the practical applications of this clinical tool. We conclude that to date, the role of QEEG is not necessarily to pinpoint an immediate diagnosis but to provide additional insight in conjunction with other diagnostic evaluations in order to objective information necessary for obtaining a precise diagnosis, correct disease severity assessment, and specific treatment response evaluation.","301":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a reversible cardiomyopathy with a unique morphological feature of the left ventricle characterized by an apical ballooning appearance known for approximately known 25 years. Catecholamine drive plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy; hence, it is also called stress cardiomyopathy. Physical stress could also have an impact and leads to a greater variety of characteristics in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Supportive and symptomatic medication remains the mainstay therapy with priority to improving the function of the left ventricle for several days and full recovery in 3-4 weeks. Due to its similarity with myocardial infarction, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy requires careful diagnosis and management for the best possible outcome.","302":"","303":"We report a case of traumatic brain injury treated with Cerebrolysin, a neurorecovery stimulating agent.

The particularity of the case is given by the complexity of the surgical interventions necessary for the reconstruction of the above-mentioned anatomical regions. In order to cover the sacral region, two gluteal myocutaneous flaps were used, followed by a tensor fascia lata flap for the trochanteric lesion. For the thoracic defect, the surgical team has chosen the technique of excision and direct suture. Following reconstructive surgery, the patient had a favorable local evolution, being included in an intensive medical recovery program within the same health unit.","308":"In the last decade, a plethora of healthcare research and literature was produced and, indeed, confirms the absolute need to cultivate a therapeutic and compassionate relationship between carer and patient\/family, especially in the face of a long-term and \/or life-threatening condition. We introduce the 3S model as an approach to cultivate a therapeutic relationship between the carer and the patient\/family. It is based on some fundamental traditional skills which may be innate for some but may need to be awakened and cultivated for others, all for the benefit of each of the members of the involved triad: patients, family, and healthcare professionals. The 3S approach aids in developing a therapeutic relationship that involves compassion and can be easily applied with significant results, especially in the context of chronic disease management. However, more research is needed to quantify the impact of this 3S approach on the therapeutic relationship and chronic disease management.","309":"A healthy lifestyle prevents more than half of diseases and disorders in humans. Social capital is a decisive factor in lifestyle modification. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of social capital on health promotion behaviors in a group of teachers from Bam, Kerman, Iran. The present study was a descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study. The participants were 245 secondary school teachers that were studied using census data. The integration of two standard questionnaires in the field of health promotion behaviors and social capital were the research instruments. Data analysis was done using the SPSS v23 software. The average age of the participants was 39.4 years. Also, none of the demographic variables had a significant effect on health promotion behaviors. The highest and lowest score of practices were related to religion believes with an average of 14.47 and physical activities with an average of 10.64. Finally, the average of health promotion behaviors and social capital in women teachers were evaluated at the desirable level. Considering the role of teachers in educating and providing knowledge to future generations, it can positively affect the health of the whole society through effective interventions on this group. This requires paying more attention to the empowerment and promote the individual and groups of teachers. Therefore, one of the natural and inexpensive ways to improve society's health is to promote health components in teachers and their self-sufficiency in the field of health.","310":"Romania has drastically improved an array of health indicators in recent years, including maternal mortality rates, which decreased from 1990 to 2015, but the mortality rates are still high, ranking among the first in Europe. Preeclampsia and eclampsia constitute one of the primary causes of maternal death in the country. The study was conducted from early January to the end of February 2019 to assess the current state of resident physicians' and midwives' knowledge of preeclampsia and eclampsia reflected in their practice at a clinical hospital in southern Romania. Self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. Most of the investigated resident physicians and midwives (87.5%) answered correctly regarding the correct definition of preeclampsia. The first choice of procedure for the patient with preeclampsia (vaginal delivery or C-section) was chosen correctly by only 37.5% of the participants. Regarding the correct identification of the necessary paraclinical tests used for women with suspected preeclampsia, 58.3% of the participants answered correctly. As far as the correct identification of the possible risks of dexamethasone administration to mothers is concerned, only 29.2% of the participants answered correctly. Also, 58.3% of the participants answered correctly regarding the correct identification of contraindicated uterotonic drugs for women with diagnosed hypertension. Resident physicians and midwives are aware of pregnancy complications, but they hold limited knowledge specific to pregnancy complications as preeclampsia and eclampsia. It is imperative to promote studies to evaluate the impact of enhancing their training to include additional content related to the early detection and management of preeclampsia and eclampsia.","311":"There is an increasing number of studies suggesting the role of genetic factors in the development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. Therefore, our study aimed to establish the role of ACE and AGT gene polymorphisms in the mechanisms behind the development of oxidative stress in patients with concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. The study group consisted of 96 patients: Group 1 (individuals with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), Group 2 (individuals with arterial hypertension), Group 3 (individuals with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arterial hypertension). The control group consisted of 20 healthy subjects. ACE and AGT gene polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels was performed by EPICS XL cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA) with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium. Serum levels of 8-isoprostane were assayed with ELISA, Cayman Chemicals (USA). No significant correlations between ACE and AGT gene polymorphisms and parameters of oxidative stress in a setting of comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension were observed. However, the increase in oxidative stress parameters was observed to be the most significant in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease + hypertension and with I\/I genotype of the ACE gene, which was due to their lowest values in virtually healthy individuals. This suggests that I\/I genotype may be associated with lower levels of reactive oxygen species production compared with other genotypes.","312":"The injury management in the acute phase of spinal cord injury starts at the accident scene and focuses on preventing and reducing secondary damages. The road traffic injured patients are mostly transferred by relatives, untrained laypeople, and the drivers of heavy vehicles. The current study explored the experience of people with spinal cord injury in the accident scene. This was a qualitative content analysis study using the semi-structured interviewing method with an interview guide for data collection. Purposive sampling method was performed within ten months until data saturation. We used the constant comparative approach recommended by Corbin and Strauss (2015). In total, 15 people with spinal cord injury and bystanders participated in this study. The central theme extracted in this study was \"emotional interaction\" that referred to the emotional reactions in managing road traffic victims. Two main categories of \"emotional intervention\" with \"emotional atmosphere,\" \"desperation,\" \"rescue efforts,\" subcategories and \"scene shock\" with \"unplanned intervention,\" \"emotional behavior,\" \"emotional decisions,\" and \"emotional involvement,\" subcategories were classified. The emotional atmosphere of the scene and stress level of the victim and the relatives, and the insistence of the victim to escape from the harsh condition have caused those lacking medical knowledge and expertise to transfer the patient unsafely. This resulted in secondary damages, like aggravated spinal cord injury or even caused the spinal cord injury.","313":"The Groningen Institute Model for Management in Care Services aims to prepare medical students for their complex tasks as family physicians, based on the CanMEDS framework. Although initially developed for pharmacy students, the present paper reports on the eight-year experience with GIMMICS for family physician students at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The Groningen Institute Model for Management in Care Services is a training game that simulates real-life situations in a structured and supervised setting. It offers students the possibility to practice clinical, practical, and communicational skills. Students install and manage their group practices, hold consultations with simulated patients, participate in several assignments and collaborate with pharmacy students. Feedback sessions showed that the training game is well-received by the students. A self-assessment questionnaire comprised of 23 questions on significant aspects of the seven CanMEDS roles showed significantly higher scores at the end of the game for 17 questions (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test ).

A significant moderate positive correlation was found between hospital information system acceptance and perceived usefulness (r = 0.54, P &lt; 0.01), perceived ease of use (r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.01), human factors (r = 0.46, P &lt; 0.01) and technological factors (r = 0.54, P &lt; 0.01). A significant weak positive correlation was detected between the acceptance of the hospital information system and organizational factors (r = 0.35, P &lt; 0.01). Perceived usefulness of the system, social influence, system quality, perceived ease of use of the system, and top managers' supports had the most substantial influence on the users' intention to accept a hospital information system. User education, preparation of guidelines suited to the user specialty or department, incorporating users' work needs into the capabilities of the hospital information system, and improving the system to an ideal level are important considerations.","315":"The need to use a natural alternative for disinfecting dental impression materials, which should be biocompatible and effective, led us to evaluate the efficacy of Aloe vera as a disinfectant by immersion and spray method on alginate impression material and its effect on the dimensional stability of the resultant gypsum cast. The efficacy of the disinfection procedures against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans was evaluated by determining the number of colony-forming units (CFU) recovered after disinfection of alginate discs inoculated with 1x106 CFU for defined intervals with aloe vera solution (99.96%). Dimensional stability was determined from the mean percentage deviation of three measurements that were taken between the fixed points on the casts using a traveling microscope and compared with corresponding measurements from the master model and controls. Statistical analysis of data was determined by analysis of variance. We found out that there is a mean percentage reduction in colony count of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans after 3 minutes of immersion in aloe vera and after 3 minutes spray disinfection. Complete elimination of all the microorganism cells after 7 min immersion and spray disinfection. There was a statistically significant difference in the increase of the mean anteroposterior (AP) and cross arch (CA) dimension after 3 and 7 minutes immersion in aloe vera. Spraying with aloe vera for 7 minutes was proved to be the most effective disinfection procedure without altering dimensional stability.","316":"The research aims to identify the respiratory pathology during the first two years of life in premature infants with gestational ages between 30-34 weeks and the risk factors for these conditions (familial, prenatal, and neonatal). There were investigated 31 premature infants with gestational ages between 30-34 weeks and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infections with the respiratory syncytial virus, or other viral infections requiring hospitalization, recurrent wheezing, and nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria were noted. Also, regression models for each type of respiratory pathology as a function of the antenatal (smoking in the family, atopy, mother's age) and neonatal (gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, duration of the treatment with antibiotics, use of the reserve antibiotics) factors were elaborated. Respiratory distress syndrome was present in 20 premature infants, and 19 infants received respiratory support. Two former premature infants presented with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 3 with severe respiratory syncytial virus infections, 7 with recurrent wheezing, and 16 with viral infections requiring hospitalization. Respiratory distress syndrome and severe viral infections were more frequently found in families of smokers. Low gestational age and familial atopy were identified as good predictors of severe respiratory syncytial virus infections (p&lt; 0.03) Premature infants with gestational ages between 30-34 weeks present with the risk of appearance of respiratory diseases during the first two years of life, especially disorders of the airways. Familial atopy and low gestational age represent independent risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus infections.","317":"The tendency toward cosmetic surgeries has been increasing all over the world. These surgeries are conducted to improve the functions related to the involved organ. Moreover, such procedures are supposed to have significant effects on an individual's physical and mental health. This study aims at comparing doctor\/patient satisfaction with the aesthetic outcomes of rhinoplasty. In the present retrospective study, 60 patients, including 26 males and 34 females, were investigated. The patients were candidates for a nose job (rhinoplasty). One week before the surgery, the doctor and the patients were provided with questionnaires including information about the nasal hump, nostrils, nose tip size, upward sloping of the nose at the tip, the display of the middle-lower nose, nasal width, the nasal proportion compared with the face, and the general satisfaction. The information on the aforementioned items was collected to record the condition of nose beauty before rhinoplasty. After the surgery, the patients and the doctor were given the same questionnaire following one-month and three-month intervals, so that the aesthetic outcomes resulted from the surgery were evaluated. In comparison to the first month, the surgeons and the patients had a higher level of satisfaction in the third month. The surgeons' satisfaction with the upward sloping of the nose at the tip, as well as the display of the middle-lower nose, was greater compared to the patients. However, the patients' satisfaction with the nostrils was higher than that of the surgeons. Regarding the other factors investigated in the present study, there was no significant difference between the satisfaction of patients and surgeons. For individuals whose educational levels were higher than high school, there was a higher satisfaction level with the nasal hump, the display of the middle-lower nose, and the nasal proportion compared with the face.","318":"Traditional therapy and extensive use of medications and intravaginal autolymphocyte therapy show different results of the treatment of vulvovaginal infections. The purpose of the article was to explore safe and highly effective methods to treat vulvovaginal infections and diseases of the pelvic organs. The standard clinical and laboratory screening of 70 patients of reproductive age was carried out to diagnose the diseases of the reproductive tract. The screening included the description of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of vaginal discharge, examining the mucous covering of the vulva and vagina, microscopic examination of Gram-stained vaginal swabs, endocervical cultures, and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections using polymerase chain reaction. Intravaginal autolymphocyte therapy was used together with traditionally-accepted treatment schemes (etiotropic antibacterial and antifungal therapy) in the treatment of the main group (40 patients). Traditional treatment methods depending on the etiology of the development of infection were used in the control group (30 patients). The IgM, IgA, and IgG levels were also observed because of the possibility of causing embryo rejection. This study shows that in case of relapsing vulvovaginitis and mixed infections accompanied by disorders of the immune system at different levels, the use of intravaginal autolymphocyte therapy in a comprehensive therapy can be assessed as advisable and pathogenetically substantiated.","319":"Coronary heart diseases are amongst the most common and severe diseases; also, the prevalence and emergence of these diseases are largely affected by psychological and social factors. The present study was conducted in order to investigate the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy in groups on the cognitive strategies of emotion regulation and self-control in patients with cardiovascular diseases. The present work is a quasi-experimental research with a pretest-posttest design and a control group. The statistical population of this study included all patients with coronary heart disease aged 35-55 years who referred to hospitals, health centers, and cardiovascular clinics of Isfahan in the spring of 2018. Among these patients, 30 patients were selected based on the inclusion criteria of the study using a convenience sampling method. They were then divided randomly into two experimental and control groups, with 15 participants in each group. The patients in the experimental group participated in eight 60-minute sessions of the Hayes' Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (2002). However, no intervention was applied to the control group. The participants responded to the research questionnaires in two phases. The questionnaires included the Garnefski's Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) (2001) and the Tangji's self-control questionnaire (2004). The research data were analyzed using covariance analysis in SPSS 24. The results of the covariance analysis indicated that the group-based acceptance and commitment therapy exerted a significant effect on the total score of the two strategies, i.e., the positive strategy of the cognitive regulation of emotions and the negative strategy of the cognitive regulation of emotions (p&lt;0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in terms of self-control (p&gt; 0.05). The findings of the present study showed that the treatment intervention resulted in increased use of acceptance strategies, positive re-focus, and re-focus, as well as reduced use of rumination and other-blaming strategies in cardiovascular patients in Isfahan.","320":"Burnout is prevalent among mental health providers and is significantly associated with the employee, consumer, and organizational costs. Nowadays, burnout prevalence is increasing and can challenge the residents' professional development, place patients at risk, and have a significant influence on a variety of personal costs. Considering its importance, this research attempted to measure the burnout experienced by Romanian psychiatric residents while also correlating demographic characteristics and work situations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 116 Romanian psychiatric residents. Our questionnaire contained socio-demographic information and burnout assessment, which was performed using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). The burnout scores were classified as high burnout (22.4% of the respondents), moderate burnout (51,7% of the respondents), and low burnout (25.9% of the respondents). As such, all psychiatric residents who suffered from high levels of burnout were satisfied with their salary and their work but dissatisfied with the resources available for attending patients. From all physicians who might experience burnout, psychiatrists are most likely to search for help. The fact that the majority of psychiatric residents in our study were satisfied with their salary and their work, but dissatisfied with the available resources for attending patients might be a result of the Romanian policy of increasing incomes for medical personnel. In conclusion, adding stress management training to the medical education curriculum could help the residents to deal more effectively with the training strain, develop personal techniques for helping themselves to improve their professional path, and potentially prevent upcoming physician burnout.","321":"The restoration of voluntary muscle activity in posttraumatic paraplegia in both animal experiments and other clinical applications requires reproducibility of a technically-demanding microsurgical procedure, limited by physicians' understanding of Brunelli's spinal cord grafting paradigm. The insufficient clinical investigation of the long-term benefits of the CNS-PNS graft application warrants additional inquiry. The objective of this study is to explore the potential benefits of the first replicated, graft-induced neuroregeneration of denervated skeletal muscle regarding long-term clinical outcomes and to investigate the effect of Cerebrolysin on neuromodulation. A randomized study evaluating 30 rats, approved by the National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee was performed. The medication was administered postoperatively. For 14 days, 12 rats received Cerebrolysin (serum), 11 received NaCl 0.9% (shams), and 7 were controls. For microsurgery, the lateral corticospinal tract T10 was grafted to the denervated internal obliquus abdominal muscle. On day 90, intraoperative proof of reinnervation was observed. On day 100, 15 rats were euthanized for fixation, organ removal, and extensive histology-morphology examination, and the Wei-Lachin statistical procedure was employed. After an open revision of 16 rats, 8 were CMAP positive. After intravenous Vecuronium application, two (Cerebrolysin, NaCl) out of two rats showed an incomplete compound muscle action potential (CMAP) loss due to glutamatergic and cholinergic co-transmission, while two others showed a complete loss of amplitude. Cerebrolysin medication initiated larger restored muscle fiber diameters and less scarring. FB+ neurons were not observed in the brain but were observed in the Rexed laminae. Brunelli's concept was successfully replicated, demonstrating the first graft induced existence of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in denervated grafted muscles. Statistics of the histometric count of muscle fibers revealed larger fiber diameters after Cerebrolysin. Brunelli's CNS-PNS experimental concept is suitable to analyze graft-neuroplasticity focused on the voluntary restoration of denervated skeletal muscles in spinal cord injury. Neuroprotection by Cerebrolysin is demonstrated.","322":"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis morbidity and mortality is on the rise due to the obesity pandemic. Its pathophysiology is not well understood and implies complex interactions between local hepatic cells populations, adipocytes, immune effectors that lead to hepatic lipid excess, lipotoxicity, cellular stress and inflammation, as well as programmed cell death. A better understanding of these pathogenic interactions would allow better identification of therapeutic targets in a disease that has no known pharmacological therapy until now.","323":"Dementia represents one of the greatest global challenges for health and social care in this century. More than 50 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, and this number is predicted to triple by 2050. Ageing is often associated with cognitive impairment. Therefore, prevention of cognitive impairment is an imperative. Dementia includes a heterogeneous group of disorders, the most common being Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Most cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation and smoking are not exclusive risk factors for vascular dementia but also for Alzheimer's disease. The ApoE4 allele is the single non-modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Today we know that an important, modifiable risk factor is education. Better education means better protection against dementia. A large number of dementia cases are potentially preventable by early intervention. Early changes in the blood vessel wall can be detected by early ultrasound methods or early biomarkers. These methods allow us to detect changes before the disease becomes clinically evident. Early disease detection enables timely management, and studies have shown that careful control of vascular risk factors can postpone the onset or even reverse disease progression.","324":"Patients with positive Her-2\/neu breast cancer and a high risk of recurrence are known to benefit from the addition of the dual blockade of Her-2\/neu with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a combination which has been demonstrated to give a higher rate of a complete pathologic response in the breast and in the axilla. The purpose of this review is to outline the efficacy of the dual blockade with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of high-risk Her-2 positive breast cancer. Electronic databases (Pubmed, Medline, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were searched for English- and German-language studies, which were published in the last ten years. The search has been focused on neoadjuvant clinical trials as well as on the data presented in the abstracts published at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium as well as at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The results reported in the published clinical trials demonstrated a higher pathologic complete response rate in breast and lymph nodes after using targeted therapy with two anti-Her-2\/neu agents - Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage Her-2\/neu positive breast cancers. The pathologic complete response rate is the most important prognostic marker in Her-2\/neu positive tumors, a higher pathologic complete response rate being demonstrated to be associated with a better survival outcome in terms of higher overall survival and disease-free survival rates.","325":"Laboratory diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism is based on determining blood levels of aldosterone, renin on request, potassium, and sodium. The results of these studies are significantly influenced by drugs, preparation for the study and blood collection methods, age, gender, and concomitant diseases. The work analyzes the factors influencing the results of the study of aldosterone and identifies the main ways of their exclusion at each stage of the diagnosis. Their neglecting is the determining factor in obtaining false results, diagnostic errors, the selection of ill-treatment tactics, and inadequate treatment. All these diagnostic problems are covered in a variety of ways in the review, which is based on the analysis of results of individual authors' research and practical and clinical recommendations from leading world endocrinological associations. Results of laboratory diagnostics of PHA depend on the influence of many factors. Among them, it is essential to use different medication drugs, the rules for preparing for the study, and the method of conducting it. In assessing the results of research, it is necessary to take into account not only the indicators of the level of aldosterone in the blood but also the features of the clinical course of the disease, its compliance to the drug therapy, age, and gender of the patients.","326":"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a highly prevalent group of heterogeneous disorders, and their diagnostic criteria are symptom-based, with the absence of anatomical and biochemical abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic visceral symptoms are common both in patients with an identifiable organic disease but also in FGID patients. Patients suffering from upper gastrointestinal functional disorders typically present with various symptoms such as early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Considering their increasing prevalence, difficulties in diagnosis, and low quality of life, FGIDs have become an emerging problem in gastroenterology. We aimed to provide an updated summary of pathways involved in visceral sensitization. We examined the recent literature searching for evidence of the most important studies about the mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal symptom generation and sensitization.","327":"","328":"","329":"Hysterectomy is the most common gynecological surgical intervention; therefore, there are many technical variations in different healthcare systems around the world. We aimed to review, step by step, the technique of laparoscopic hysterectomy as well as to present the available variety of surgical instruments impartially so that the operative team can decide in an informed manner the model and characteristics of the equipment used. The surgical technique is presented based on the experience of the authors, focusing mainly on intraoperative recommendation and suggestions. Advantages and disadvantages of the available instruments are also extensively detailed. Surgical positioning, as well as inserting the uterine manipulator are essential steps. The open technique is used to create pneumoperitoneum. The utero-ovarian ligament or the infundibulopelvic ligament is identified, coagulated and cut. The round ligament is incised, entering the space between the two layers of the broad ligament and advancing caudally in this space, which, if correctly identified, should be avascular. The uterine vessels located on the posterior sheet of the broad ligament are dissected and coagulated. The vaginal wall is sectioned with the help of the manipulator's cap, making it easier to expose the insertion line of the vagina on the cervix. The uterus is removed through the vagina or through a trans-parietal incision. Thereafter, the vagina is sutured using separate Vicryl sutures. Between 2011 and 2016, laparoscopic hysterectomy had an increasing trend all over Europe. With a reported percentage of 3%, Romania ranks last in hysterectomies performed laparoscopically. The laparoscopic approach offers the advantages of minimal invasiveness: less pain, faster recovery and early social reintegration; therefore, this trend of improvement should become more accepted.","330":"During menstruation, endometrial hemostasis is achieved by platelet aggregation, fibrin deposition, and thrombus formation that interact with local endocrine and immunological factors which cause termination of menstrual bleeding. Interactions between steroidal sex hormones and platelet functions are not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of platelet function during the menstrual cycle and luteal phase in women of reproductive age. The cross-sectional study on women of reproductive age included 44 healthy women. Platelet function was assessed by PFA-100TM analyzer with collagen\/epinephrine and collagen\/ADP cartridges during the menstrual cycle and luteal phase. There were no significant differences in platelet function between menstruation and ovulatory phase. Platelet activity in Arab collagen\/epinephrine cartridge increased during menstruation compared to non-Arab ethnic subjects and no significant differences in platelet function were found when using collagen\/ADP cartridge. This study suggested modulation in platelet functions during menstruation and luteal phase in women of reproductive age. Further studies, including a large number of subjects, platelet genetic and progesterone factors change in platelet clotting associated to menstrual cycle should be conducted.","331":"The purpose of this study is to scrutiny the Dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with PICS with 2nd type DM against the background of Taurine (TN) and meldonium (ME). The results of the investigations prove the decrease of the oxidative stress, which is basis of DACN, under the influence of sulfur-containing amino acid taurine (TN), and meldonium (ME) - a competitive inhibitor of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Biochemical mechanisms of synergistic action of ME and TN are also described. The results of the studies of 98 patients with PICS and concomitant 2nd type diabetes mellitus were analyzed. They were distributed by simple randomization method into two groups, comparable according to age and sex: the main group (MG) (n = 68): and group of comparison (GoC) (n = 30). HRV was evaluated twice daily at the Cardiosense HMEGG system: at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. For the assessment of HRV the frequency and spectral parameters were used. While evaluating the different methods of treatment, their influence on the range of spectral and time indices of HRV was determined (p = 0.001 by the criterion of Kruskall-Wallis). It was learned that the combined application of ME and TN gives a statistically significant (p &lt;0.01) increase of SDNN, HF at night, pNN - on 50% by day (p &lt;0.01, p &lt;0.001 and p &lt;0.01 respectively), and statistically significant decrease in LF at night, compared to GHG.","332":"Hysterosalpingography is one of the essential diagnostic methods for examining women who have difficulty becoming pregnant. This procedure is somehow invasive and is associated with numerous complications such as allergic sensitivity, pain, abdominal cramps and shock. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of evening primrose on cervical length and pain during and after hysterosalpingography. In this double-blind clinical trial, 66 candidates for hysterosalpingography were randomly divided into two groups. A group received 1000 mg of evening primrose orally for two days prior to hysterosalpingography, while the control group received a placebo drug similar in size to evening primrose three days prior to hysterosalpingography. The pain level was recorded based on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), during tenaculum placement but also immediately and four hours after hysterosalpingography. Finally, the data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of pain during insertion of speculum and injection of the contrast medium (p &lt;0.05). Less pain was reported in the evening primrose group compared to placebo. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the length and diameter of the cervix (p &lt;0.05). Given the fact that it is a medicinal plant with no complications and can reduce pain during speculum insertion and during contrast medium injection, evening primrose seems to be a good drug for managing pain during hysterosalpingography.","333":null,"334":"Pelvic organ prolapse is a common complaint among older women. Vaginal pessary insertion is an appropriate treatment as a non-surgical method with few complications. This paper is a prospective observational study of 68 patients with pelvic organ prolapse that was carried out at the Imam Khomeini Hospital's Pelvic Floor clinic. The degree of pelvic organ prolapse was graded according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) System. For all patients, the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 (PFDI-20) questionnaire was completed before vaginal pessary insertion, and after approximately 6 months of treatment. After 6-8 months, we found out that vaginal discharge was significantly increased and the feeling of fullness in the vagina was significantly decreased. However, sexual dissatisfaction, the feeling of incomplete evacuation, fecal and urinary incontinence, frequent urination, and pain or discomfort in the genital region were not significantly different after using a pessary. Approximately half a year later, 96.7% of the women with a successful pessary fitting trial were satisfied and reported a significant improvement in symptoms. Further studies with larger sample size, a different type of pessary, and a longer follow-up duration are recommended to evaluate all the symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse and its treatment.","335":"The peculiarities of the microbiocenosis of the uterine cavity in 184 patients of reproductive age with different types of endometrial hyperproliferative processes were studied: Group 1, n=60, non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia (NAEH); Group 2, n=62, endometrial polyps (EPs); Group 3, n=62, NAEH + EPs. Correlation analysis of the degree of association between different biological media (uterus and genital tract) was carried out. Contamination of the uterine cavity by bacterial flora was diagnosed in all groups of patients examined. Anaerobic flora was about 30% while bacteria of the genus Bacteroides were the most common. Among aerobic organisms, representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae family and coccal flora are noted. The widest was the spectrum of isolated microorganisms in patients of group 2 (with endometrial polyps). A strong positive correlation was established between indices of genital tract contamination and the uterine cavity by coccal flora, Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms. The findings suggest dysbiotic changes and the presence of a chronic inflammatory focus in the endometrium, which pathogenetically substantiates the application of anti-inflammatory therapy in such patients.","336":null,"337":null,"338":"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) caused by incorrect working positions among dentists is a serious health issue and one that leads to decreased productivity and quality of life. Muscle activity and strain is correlated with higher surface temperatures due to increased metabolic activity [2]. The main objective of this study is to evaluate, using thermal imaging, the muscular strain experienced by oral healthcare professionals during work depending on their position, and to assess whether periodic stretching exercises have an impact on preventing MSDs. The study included four subjects and used thermal imaging to evaluate the heat pattern produced by muscle strain in two different states, one while working in incorrect postures and the other after performing stretching exercises. We used a FLIRB200 thermal imaging camera to measure skin surface temperature changes of the underlining muscles in the cervical, right arm triceps, and lumbar areas. According to the imaging, all four subjects recorded a drop in temperature in evaluated muscle regions after performing stretching exercises, corresponding to a decrease in muscle strain. Thermal imaging can be effectively used to evaluate muscle strain and MSDs. Stretching exercises could be viewed as effective preventive measures to avoid MSDs caused by erroneous work postures, however, more subjects are required to draw a definite conclusion.","339":null,"340":"Dysphagia is recorded in approximately a third of ischemic stroke patients and is associated with malnutrition, aspiration, and pneumonia. We report a case study that assessed dysphagia (GUSS, Gugging Swallowing Screen), paralysis (MRC, Medical Research Council), and disability (mRS, modified Rankin Scale) in the AVANT program (Austrian Vietnamese Advancement Neurorehabilitation Treatment) - a collaboration program between Vietnam and Austria to standardize and systemize neurorehabilitation after stroke practice in Vietnam.","341":"Finding neuroprotective agents to counteract the deleterious effects of hypoxia on neuronal cells successfully is one of the most critical targets of clinical research since preclinical studies have identified potential neuroprotective strategies. In clinical practice, amantadine and piracetam are used with reasonable success. We present the cases of three patients with acute brain hypoxia secondary to cardiac arrest, to whom Cerebrolysin was added to the standard neuroprotective treatment regimen, leading to a notable improvement in functional outcome.","342":"This case report presents the evolution of a patient with recurrent ischemic stroke, in the context of treatment with multimodal agent cerebrolysin, as an add-on to neurological rehabilitation and tDCS therapy. The patient was evaluated before and after treatment using a battery of tests such as the Nine-Hole Peg Test, handgrip force, Functional Hand Scale (1-5), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Active Range of Motion (AROM) for the left shoulder, registering visible improvements in functional motor recovery after this therapeutic combination.","343":"Almost 30 years have passed since the term 'tissue engineering' was created to represent a new concept that focuses on the regeneration of neotissues from cells with the support of biomaterials and growth factors. This interdisciplinary engineering has attracted much attention as a new therapeutic means that may overcome the drawbacks involved in the current artificial organs and organ transplantation that have also been aiming at replacing lost or severely damaged tissues or organs. However, the tissues regenerated by tissue engineering and widely applied to patients are still minimal, including skin, bone, cartilage, capillary, and periodontal tissues. What are the reasons for such slow advances in clinical applications of tissue engineering? This article gives a brief overview of the current state of tissue engineering, covering the fundamentals and applications. The fundamentals of tissue engineering involve cell sources, scaffolds for cell expansion and differentiation, as well as carriers for growth factors. Animal and human trials are a major part of the applications. Based on these results, some critical problems to be resolved for the advances of tissue engineering are addressed from the engineering point of view, emphasizing the close collaboration between medical doctors and biomaterials scientists.","344":"The last decade has seen incredible advances in the genetic era, in next-generation sequencing of cell-free DNA in the maternal plasma, detecting abnormal fetal chromosomes. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has showed increased sensitivity and specificity for Down syndrome superior to any other screening test. Technical advances have made possible the detection of other conditions which does not necessarily mean clinical benefit for the patient. Private laboratories have added multiple conditions in the panel of NIPT, but some of these abnormalities are so rare, that their prevalence is not even clear. Data regarding clinical performance of extended NIPT is lacking. Implementation of such a test has to be carefully weighed, and not only the benefits but also the harm should be taken into account.","345":"The final stage of the diagnostic of primary hyperaldosteronism is to identify the causes of excessive secretion of aldosterone and determination of its variants. Based on the analysis of literature data, the diagnostic value, sensitivity and specificity of the methods of radiation diagnostics for primary hyperaldosteronism were assessed: ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, photon emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, scintigraphy with iodine radiopharmaceuticals. The causes of false-positive and false-negative evaluations of changes in adrenal glands in the application of these diagnostics have been analyzed. There are many genetic and morphological studies when searching the literature data on the principles and methods of distinguishing the nosological forms of primary hyperaldosteronism based on the results of the aldosterone level estimation in the separated blood from the central veins of both adrenal glands or segmental veins of one gland with subsequent determination of the concentration gradient. It was noted that topical diagnostics and, especially, the determination of nosological forms of primary hyperaldosteronism are complex and expensive, but their results allow choosing an appropriate treatment approach for each particular case.","346":"This is a narrative review of telemonitoring (remote monitoring) projects and studies within the field of diabetes, with a focus on results of the more recent studies. Since the beginning of the 1990s, several telemedicine projects and studies focused on type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Over the last 5 years, numerous telemedicine projects based on connected objects and new information and communication technologies (ICT) (elements defining telemedicine 2.0) have emerged or are still under development. Two examples are the DIABETe and Telesage telemonitoring project which perfectly fits within the telemedicine 2.0 framework - the first to include artificial intelligence (AI) with MyPrediTM and DiabeoTM. Mainly, these projects and studies show that telemonitoring diabetic result in: improvements in control of blood glucose (BG) level and significant reduction in HbA1c (e.g., for Telescot et TELESAGE studies); positive impact on co-morbidities (arterial hypertension, weight, dyslipidemia) (e.g., for Telescot and DIABETe studies); better patient's quality of life (e.g., for DIABETe study); positive impact on appropriation of the disease by patients and\/or greater adherence to therapeutic and hygiene-dietary measures (e.g., The Utah Remote Monitoring Project); and at least, good receptiveness by patients and their empowerment. To date, the magnitude of its effects remains debatable, especially with the variation in patients' characteristics (e.g., background, ability for self-management, medical condition), samples selection and approach for the treatment of control groups. All of the recent studies have been classified as \"Moderate\" to \"High\".","347":"","348":"Most studies on patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) regard pre-post Tap test and long-term follow-up after shunt surgery. Quantitative and qualitative assessment tools specific to rehabilitation medicine can provide an objective measurement of the benefit of the neurosurgical intervention at 1-month follow-up. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the early benefit of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt with low or medium pressure valve on the gait capacity of persons with NPH, one month after surgery. This is a retrospective study reviewing 19 inpatients with NPH who underwent neurosurgery for ventriculoperitoneal shunt with low or medium pressure valve, one month after a positive result on a tap test, in a 5-year period. The assessments regarding the gait abilities were performed 24 hours before the surgical intervention and one month after surgery. Assessment tools used were: the 3 meters Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), the 10 Meters Walking Test (10MWT) and the Berg Balance Scale. A positive response to the tap test predicted improvements of gait and balance in patients with NPH after shunt surgery. Best results in regards to gait and balance are achieved when early diagnosis and intervention are performed. Complex comorbidities generate and enhance significant and persistent gait impairment.","349":"This paper presented a special case and shortly described the congenital malformations of a child operated at the age of 2 years and 7 months. Medical literature does not mention the cases of double or triple congenital scoliosis. 54 patients were treated, out of whom, 39 were operated during the period of 2000 and 2012. This series presented 4 patients with double congenital scoliosis and 2 with triple congenital scoliosis. All these axial deviations were due to hemivertebrae with longitudinal imbalance of the spine, if these hemivertebrae were present on a distance of at least 5 normal vertebrae.","350":"Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disease which is characterized by the deficiency of serum calcium levels. RhPTH is prescribed as a therapy for the management of refractory hypoparathyroidism. The aim of this study is to investigate 32 signal peptides of gram-negative bacterial origin and evaluate their potential for efficient secretion of recombinant human PTH (1-84)In E.coli to obtain higher expression of recombinant PTH in bacterial systems by using this fusion partner. SignalP and ProtParam servers were employed to predict the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in protein sequence and computation of various physical and chemical parameters of protein respectively. Also, SOLpro server was applied for prediction of the protein solubility. Then ProtComp and SecretomeP online servers were employed to determine protein location. The evaluations showed that theoretically two signal peptides Lipopolysaccharide export system protein LptA (lptA) and Periplasmic pH-dependent serine endoprotease DegQ (degQ) are the most appropriate signal peptides examined. Due to the lack of post-translational modification in PTH, its periplasmic expression has preferences. Based on the results of this study, using bioinformatics and reliable servers signal peptides with appropriate secretory potential can be obtained which lead to the highest expression level.","351":"Weight gain during pregnancy can be a real risk factor for long-term obesity which has implications in all areas of medicine. This study is designed to assess pregnancy-related weight gain and postpartum weight loss, to identify a possible correlation between weight gain during pregnancy and the risk of obesity in the late postpartum period. The batch comprised 306 women, hospitalized in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Section of the \"Nicolae Malaxa\" Clinical Hospital between June - November 2017. During this study, we assessed the weight status using the Weight, Body Mass Index, Height, and Abdominal Circumference. These parameters were clinically assessed in three periods pre-pregnancy, early postpartum period, late postpartum period. We also collected data on the evolution of the pregnancy using the anamnesis and the personal pregnancy monitoring sheet. Pregnancy and postpartum period represent a key moment in women's lives in which the risk of obesity is real. Understanding women experiences with weight changes during pregnancy and postpartum period can improve the management of losing weight following pregnancy, avoid long-term weight gain and so reduce the risk for obesity. Also, the correct management of obesity should include the assessment of somatic disorders that may cause major dysfunction, requiring complex rehabilitation programs.","352":"Patients feel uncomfortable with cervical manipulation, uterine distension and stimulation of peritoneum during hysterosalpingography (HSG) and experience lower abdominal pain during and after the procedure. Pain during the procedure has a negative effect on the adaptation of patients to treatment and physicians are trying to overcome this unpleasant situation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of midazolam and dexmedetomidine on reducing pain and spasm of fallopian tubes during and after HSG procedure in women with infertility. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 102 patients were randomly divided into two groups, midazolam and dexmedetomidine. The pain was recorded during injection and immediately after injection and 30 minutes after HSG, and then the complications of injection were recorded. Finally, the data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Based on the results presented herein, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of vasovagal reaction, spasticity of the tube and the side of the spastic tube and uterine cavity anomalies (p &lt;0.05). However, the pain showed a significant difference between the two groups during the injection, immediately or at 30 minutes after the procedure (p = 0.0001). The pain in the midazolam group was less than that of dexmedetomidine. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding spasticity (p &lt;0.05). There is a benefit in terms of pain reduction with the use of dexmedetomidine when comparing with midazolam injection. However, dexmedetomidine does not cause side effects in patients and can be used to reduce pain during injection.","353":"There is evidence that infection by H. pylori can have a critical proportion in the development of hepatocyte injury and both noncancerous and malignant liver conditions including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This is attributed to several mechanisms, the most important one being the toxic products of the bacterium H. pylori and oxidative injury for hepatocytes which promotes hepatic injury. The present research was aimed at determining the association between H. pylori infection and the prevalence of NAFLD in Birjand, Iran. Two groups were included in this cross-sectional study at the outpatient university clinic. One group had NAFLD (65 patients) and the other group was healthy controls without NAFLD (65 subjects). The diagnosis of NAFLD was performed using abdominal ultrasound examination and the absence of taking steatogenic medications or alcohol. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG and fecal H. pylori antigen were tested for diagnosing of H. pylori infection using ELISA method. H. pylori infection diagnosis was made if both tests were positive. None of the subjects in either group had symptoms related to the digestive system including dyspepsia, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), or epigastric pain suspicious of peptic ulcer disease. There were 37 patients (28.5%) in both NAFLD (22 cases, 33.8%) and control (15 cases, 23.1%) groups whose H. pylori tests (both IgG and fecal antigen) were positive. Statistically, no significant difference was observed between the two studied groups regarding H. pylori infection frequency (p = 0.37). Asymptomatic H. pylori infection rate was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and control subjects in Birjand, Iran.","354":"The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing in Iran. Collection of patients' data is commonly conducted through using medical records. However, for providing a structured reporting based on the information needs, a minimum data set is a fast, inexpensive, and suitable method. For exchanging high-quality data between different healthcare centers and health monitoring organization, the data are required to be uniformly collected and registered. The present study aims at designing an MDS for creating the registry of GDM. The present study is an applied one, conducted in two stages, with a qualitative Delphi method in 2018. In the first stage of the study, it was attempted to extract the data elements of mothers with GDM, through reviewing the related studies and collecting these patients' data from the medical records. Then, based on the results of the first stage, a questionnaire including demographic, clinical, and pharmaceutical data was distributed among 20 individuals including gynecologists, pharmacists, nurses, and midwives. The validity of the questionnaire was examined by a team of experts and its reliability was examined by using Cronbach's alpha. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, and mean) and excel. An MDS of gestational diabetes mellitus was developed. This MDS divided into three categories: administrative, clinical, and pharmaceutical with 4, 18, and 2 sections and 35, 199, and 12 data elements, respectively. Determining the minimum data sets of GDM will be an effective step toward integrating and improving data management of patients with GDM. Moreover, it will be possible to store and retrieve the data related to these patients.","355":"Analyzing colon biopsies is becoming time consuming and a financial burden as colonoscopy is now the main screening and diagnostic procedure of the main gastrointestinal diseases. Colon sampling can provide important information when used accordingly; otherwise it may only load the medical system unnecessarily. Our aim was to retrospectively analyze criteria for colon biopsies and correlate the diagnostic value of randomly sampling colon, especially in patients with diarrhea. This was a retrospective study on 2109 colonoscopies done over one year. Data was collected from the ENDORAD system and included variables such as: age, gender, quality of preparation, procedure, symptoms, biopsies (type, location), and endoscopy and histology findings. Data was analyzed in a descriptive manner. Out of 496 random biopsies, only 7.4% had positive histology findings. The main symptom was diarrhea and 186 cases of patients complaining of diarrhea with normal colonoscopy had random colon sampling. In 5.3% of these cases histology assessment showed changes of microscopic colitis. Fisher's test was significant when correlating the odds of having random biopsies in patients with and without diarrhea and patients younger and older than 60. Random sampling of colon during colonoscopies should be done only in selected patients otherwise it has a low diagnostic value.","356":"Pain control during and after any surgical procedure, is extremely essential for the comfort of patients. Pain killers used routinely act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase to control pain and inflammation. Cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most cell types, including platelets, whereas Cox-2 is absent from most healthy tissues but is induced by pro-inflammatory or proliferative stimuli. Cox-1 plays a role in the production of prostaglandins involved in protection of the gastric mucosal layer and thromboxanes (TX) in platelets. Cox-2 generally mediates elevations of prostaglandins associated with inflammation, pain, and pyresis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen are generally nonselective inhibitors of Coxs. This lack of selectivity has been linked to their propensity to cause gastrointestinal side effects. The new Cox-2 selective inhibitors, or coxibs, show the same anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects as nonselective NSAIDs but are supposed to have reduced side-effect profiles. This study evaluates whether rofecoxib (50 mg) given one hour pre-operatively or the same drug given one hour post-operatively is more effective in controlling the pain and swelling in mandibular third molar surgery.","357":null,"358":"Colon cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal cancers in developed countries with varied incidence and the onset age of disease worldwide. Overall, 161 participants who were under patronage of a local relief foundation and referred to the endoscopy ward of Razi Hospital affiliated to the Guilan University of Medical Sciences. These patients have been aged more than 50 or more than 40 years with history of colorectal cancer in their first-degree family were enrolled from March 2016-March 2017. Demographic information were collected. Colonoscopy was performed and histopathological evaluation of observed lesions and polyps was done. Most of participants were female (113 individuals, 70.2%) and aged 50-60 years (83 individuals, 51.6%). Seventy-four (46%) had certain lesions. Most of colonoscopy findings were observed in the ascending colon in which depressed polyps and diverticulum were most frequent. However, rectum showed the most histological findings. All polyps of descending and ascending colons were neoplastic, while most of rectal polyps were non-neoplastic. Male patients, who were aged more than 60 years and smokers had significant higher percentage of both lesions and polyps in their colon (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, significant positive association was detected between exposure to harmful industries and having polyps (p=0.01). We found male gender, higher age, smoking, and exposure to harmful industries as important risk factors for having colorectal lesions, which must be confirmed in further studies.","359":"Aspergillus species (sp.) that causes opportunistic infections have been increasingly found in human mainly immunosuppressive patients around the world every year. The main objective was to use a rapid and cheap molecular method for monitoring Aspergillus infections and epidemiological approaches. In order to identity Aspergilli species (spp.), a number of molecular methods including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) have been employed in accordance with ribosomal RNA amplification. The focus of this study - a group of hospitalized patients with clinical and subclinical signs of infection. All of the collected clinical specimens were transported to the medical mycology lab and examined for Aspergillus identification. The environmental specimens were collected from air and surfaces inspected for the Aspergillus within the hospital sources. At first, growth characteristics and microscopic features on mycological media for the identification of Aspergillus sp. were performed. For the confirmation of Aspergillus isolates which similarly found in clinical and environmental sources, molecular method polymerase chain reaction\/restriction fragment length polymorphism was carried out. From the mentioned specimens, 102 fungal isolates included Candida spp., Aspergillus spp. and other fungi. Aspergillus flavus (47%), Aspergillus fumigatus (29.4%) and Aspergillus niger (23.5%) all were found as the most common clinical isolates. In addition, Aspergillus isolates from environmental were Aspergillus niger (43.7%), Aspergillus flavus (41.7%), Aspergillus fumigatus (14.6%). Therefore, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism with a single restriction enzyme can be very useful in the identification of Aspergillus spp., because of its facility in use, speed, robust, and high sensitivity of diagnosis.","360":"Iran is among the countries which change official time, every year according to their constitutions. Studies have shown an increase of incidence ratio (IR) of acute myocardial infarction by these time transitions. Despite annual time changes in Iran, there is no published data to prove this among the Iranian. This retrospective study examined the IR of patients with AMI, who were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of 5 teaching hospitals during the week just after the time transitions (observed period), with two weeks before and after the time transitions (expected period), both in spring and fall. In total, 11051 patients were admitted during the ten weeks (observed and expected), in both spring and fall time transitions. The IR of AMI during both observed and expected period did not show any significant difference (p &gt; 0.05); however, the incidence of AMI was increased during the first week after the transition in spring (p &gt; 0.05). Although the results of the present study did not prove the relation between time transitions and incidence of AMI, a slight increase existed for IR of AMI during three days after spring shift. This increase in IR of AMI can be due to Nowrooz, the national holidays which lasts four days after turning clocks forward in Iran.","361":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are classified as chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which have similar symptoms and lead to digestive disorders and inflammation in the digestive system. The reason why they occur is still a mystery. A number of factors can be attributed to the prevalence of CD and UC, some of which include geographical location, inappropriate diet, genetics, and inappropriate immune response. Both diseases are more often diagnosed in urban areas compared to rural areas and both have their own challenges and side effects, but the patients can still have a good quality of life. Given the fact that the prevalence of this disease is higher at younger ages and that it disrupts half the life of the patient, it will, most likely, become a major health problem in the near future, even in developing countries. By reviewing valid scientific resources and evaluating new methods of addressing this disease, the present study aims to provide researchers and patients with new insights into this field and facilitate access to new treatments.","362":"We found differences related to the neuro-functional deficiency and clinical progress, among non-consumers and chronic consumers of ethanol, with recent traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We present a synthesis of related data on lesion mechanisms in post-traumatic myelogenous disorders, namely some of the alcohols and their actions on the nervous system, with details on the influences exerted, in such afflictions, by the chronic consumption of ethanol. The subject is not frequently approached - according to a literature review with systematic elements, which we have done before - thus constituting a niche that deserves to be further explored. The applicative component of the article highlights statistical data resulted from a retrospective study regarding the specialized casuistry from the Neuromuscular Recovery Clinic of the \"Bagdasar Arseni\" Emergency Clinical Hospital, following the comparative analysis of two groups of patients with recent SCI: non-consumers - the control group (n=780) - and chronic ethanol consumers - the study group (n=225) - with the addition of a prospective pilot component. Data processing has been achieved with SPSS 24. The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) mean motor scores differ significantly (tests: Mann-Whitney and t) between the control and study group in favor of the second, both at admission (p&lt;0.001) and at discharge (p&lt;0.001). AIS mean sensitive scores differ between the two lots, and also in favor of the study, but statistically significant only at discharge (p=0.048); the difference at admission is not significant (p=0.51) - possibly because of alcoholic-nutritional polyneuropathy. These findings, with numerous related details, later presented in the text, are surprising, which requires further studies and attempts of understanding.","363":"","364":"","365":"The factors which influence patients in their choice of a dental care office has recently become more complex. Our objective was to assess the correlations between different key factors (demographic aspects, dentists' professionalism, factors related to dental care offices) that influence the selection of a particular dental care office by adult patients. An online questionnaire (self-administered survey) was applied to a random sample of 117 adult dental patients in private clinics in Bucharest, Romania. The survey consisted of 12 questions, and it was conducted during a 2-week period. All the collected data were subjected to statistical analysis. The obtained results revealed statistically significant correlations between studied factors, i.e., elderly patients compared to younger patients considered the use of the state-of-the-art medical devices was important for the dental office (p=0.043, R=0.187). In comparison to women, male patients were searching more often information regarding the dental offices on social media (p=0.002, R=0.284); patients that attached more importance to the dentist's professional degree were the ones that attached more importance to its reputation (p&lt;0.001, R=0.381) and to the dental office location (p=0.022, R=0.211). The results highlighted specific patterns in patients' perception of factors related to the selection of dental offices, as also found in scientific literature. The present study offers a perspective on how to improve dental care and patients' oral health.","366":"Satisfaction with the experience gained in clinical settings is of great significance to nursing students and novice first-year students in particular and contributes significantly to developing basic clinical skills and competence. Accordingly, the present study aimed to examine nursing student satisfaction with the first clinical education experience. A total of 390 second- and third-semester nursing students gaining clinical experience in general surgery, internal medicine, gynecological surgery, orthopedics, emergency, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, andrological surgery, post-CCU, and otorhinolaryngology departments participated in this analytical cross-sectional study from March to June 2017. The research instrument included the \"Assessment of nursing student's Satisfaction with First Clinical Practical Education Questionnaire: Modified Version\", consisting of three parts: demographic characteristics, 37 items, and a 10-degree visual analog scale to assess student satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were used to hypothesis test in SPSS 22. The highest rate of student satisfaction was related to the third domain labeled \"Instructor's behavior\", and the lowest rate of student satisfaction was related to the fifth and seventh domains labeled \"Emotional atmosphere and learning in the clinical setting\" and \"Creating appropriate learning opportunities\", respectively. The results of statistical tests suggested a statistically significant relationship between the mean satisfaction score (based on the 10-degree scale) and gender (p=0.01). However, no statistically significant relationship was observed between the mean satisfaction score and other demographic characteristics such as age, grade point average (GPA), and university type. Student satisfaction rate varies in different domains of the questionnaire. Accordingly, it is recommended that schools of nursing and midwifery incorporate the findings of this study into their first clinical, educational experience planning and take into account the educational needs of students to bring greater satisfaction.","367":"We aim to demonstrate that multidisciplinary treatment through neurosurgical intervention, pharmacotherapy, rehabilitation, speech, and psychological therapy is the most promising treatment approach for patients with severe craniocerebral injuries. Here we describe two clinical cases who presented with an unexpectedly positive outcome as both patients regained mobility and the ability to function independently after receiving multimodal therapy.","368":"Pelvic organ prolapse is a frequent female pathology, often causing a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. The purpose of this paper is to present the results that we have achieved in 32 patients with anterior vaginal compartment prolapse, managed using the transvaginal mesh approach. Over a period of twelve months, we have performed 32 transvaginal reconstructive procedures using a four arms polypropylene mesh. The superior arms of the mesh have been passed through the obturator foramen while the inferior arms have been passed through the sacrospinous ligament. The surgery has lead to a significant improvement in the quality of life in this group of patients, this being assessed using self-administered questionnaires that evaluated the quality of life, the sexual function, and urinary continence. Anatomical success was achieved in 96.87% of the cases. In terms of postoperative complications, we mention one case of vaginal erosion, one case of de novo dyspareunia and three cases of pelvic discomfort. So far we have not encountered any mesh exposure cases nor prolapse recurrence. Considering the results that we have achieved in our study, we can conclude that the transvaginal polypropylene mesh approach can prove itself to be a viable solution for the management of genital prolapse, especially if we consider the high postoperative rates of anatomical success and low rates of postoperative complications, as well as improving the patient's quality of life. In spite of these encouraging results, the fact that in recent years FDA has emitted several warnings in terms of postoperative complications following such procedures, as well as the fact that our study was conducted on a small group of patients, limits the strength of our research, its only purpose being to present our experience for this surgical approach over a limited period of time.","369":"Reproductive health is vital for human and infertility is also one of the most important challenges in the reproductive system. Infertility is one of the most common chronic health disorders, regardless of age. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) helps to manage infertility by monitoring and evaluating infertility interventions based on collecting data. The development of MDS is an essential objective in order to implement an infertility monitoring system for the creation of standardized and effective data management through the provision of comprehensive and identical data elements for infertility. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in 2017. The data has been collected from infertility clinics in the world, as well as WHO, CDC, ASRM, and ESHRE reports. In order to decide on data elements, the Delphi technique was used using a questionnaire that contained data elements which were distributed among 12 experts including one reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellow, six obstetrician-gynecologists, two reproductive biologists, two urologists and one community medicine specialist using the 5 point Likert scale. The questionnaire was divided into two categories: managerial and clinical, each with 4 sections, and 60 and 940 data elements, respectively. MDS is an essential tool for evaluating the infertility process. Using this tool will provide an opportunity to develop a set of quality care criteria that can be used to ensure the quality of infertility care.","370":"Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-negative Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a severe form of autoimmune renal injury with a bleak prognosis. A 60-year-old Indian woman was treated with classical homeopathy for ANCA-negative RPGN, and after one year of treatment, serum creatinine and other parameters indicating renal injury dropped steadily despite the withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs; renal dialysis, which was conducted twice a week initially, was made rarer and stopped after one year. Classical homeopathy may be considered a potential therapeutic modality in severe pathologies. Controlled studies are required to establish further the extent to which classical homeopathy may relieve patients from procedures such as dialysis that cause considerable physical and economic discomfort.","371":"This study aimed to assess the masticatory efficiency in patients with a removable dental prosthesis, presenting different systemic, oral and prosthetic states while chewing different foods. The study was conducted on a convenient sample of patients aged 45 and above, with removable prostheses in at least one jaw. Patients were asked to chew samples of digestive biscuits, apple, and carrot, until the sensation of swallowing. The recorded masticatory function parameters were: chewing time, the number of mastication cycles, mean masticatory cycle duration, and chewing frequency. We found out that the masticatory functional parameters registered statistically significant differences according to the chewed food (e.g., generally the highest values were recorded for carrot and lowest for apple), most likely this being in relation to food's consistency, wetting, and adherence. High positive correlations were found between the chewing time and the number of mastication cycles for all three foods taken into consideration. Higher values for chewing time and number of mastication cycles were found for all foods in patients with complete dentures and overdentures, and while chewing carrot in patients with altered general status and of advanced age. Therefore, it that it takes a different time and number of mastication cycles to complete chewing, in relation to individual and food characteristics, to the systemic, oral and prosthetic patient's status. The residual teeth number and the type of prosthetic rehabilitation favor the adaptation and improvement of masticatory parameters and can have marker value for masticatory efficiency.","372":"Walk-in patients who do not require urgent treatment at an emergency department (ED) are a known and long-standing problem. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of walk-in patients visiting the ED over time. During four days in June 2012, all walk-in patients attending the ED of the University Hospital Brussels between 8 AM and 11 PM were recorded. A similar registration took place in the same ED in June 2001. Patients completed a questionnaire about their characteristics and the reason for the encounter. Data of both study periods were compared. The mean age of the patients attending the ED was significantly lower in 2001 (40.9 years) than in 2012 (43.9 years) (p=0,02). In 2001, 81% of the participants had Belgian nationality, but in 2012 this proportion increased to 90% (p=0.008). In 2001 as well as in 2012, 21% of the participants had a referral from their family physician (FP) (p=0.9). The proportion of patients that were aware that FP could also handle some emergencies increased from 17% in 2001 to 29% in 2012 (p=0.003). More patients had complaints that begun less than 24h before they attended the ED (48% in 2001 and 58% in 2012) (p=0.03). The walk-in patients at the ED are getting slightly older and are attending the ED faster after the onset of the complaints. More patients judge their complaints as urgent. However, more patients are getting aware that FP also could handle some emergencies.","373":"Glomus tumors are frequently associated with pain, tenderness and cold sensitivity. We report the diagnosis and successful surgical management of a case of a classic glomus tumor in a young woman. The clinical diagnosis was made on the basis of medical history and MRI findings. The lesion was excised via a dorsolateral subungual approach, leading to the complete resolution of symptoms. Histology confirmed the lesion to be a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are painful subungual lesions. They produce a throbbing or lancinating local discomfort, cold-sensitivity, and severe pain following minor trauma. The diagnosis is confirmed by histology, but the clinical diagnosis is highly suggestive. Complete excision will usually relieve pain. Recurrence is common following incomplete resection.","374":"Previous studies have established a correlation between empathy and burnout among healthcare providers. The aim of this study is to explore whether empathy - the ability to understand what another person is experiencing, was related to mental healthcare staffs' burnout. We performed a descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study among medical and nursing mental healthcare staff working in the district of Moselle, France. Participants completed a survey including The French versions of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSPE) and The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). The sample included 241 (n=241) participants (N=420, response rate=51.7%). 187 (77.6%) respondents had low burnout, 43 (17.8%) had intermediate burnout and 11 (4.6%) had high burnout. 41 (17%) had low empathy, 156 (64.7) had moderate empathy and 44 (18.3%) scored high. Empathy scores were positively correlated with scores of personal accomplishment of the MBI-HSS (r=0.2; p&lt;0.001), but negatively correlated with scores of depersonalization (r=-0.2; p&lt;0.003). Highest means of depersonalization (DP) (M=8.7; SD=6.8; p&lt;0.009) and lowest means of compassionate care (M=40.05; SD=7.9; p=0.0001) were found among forensic psychiatric security units staff. Participation in the Omega educational program was associated with lower scores of EE on the MBI-HSS survey (mean score 14.7 versus a mean score of 19.7 for nonparticipants). Empathic mental healthcare providers have lower levels of burnout. Forensic psychiatric staff showed low means of compassionate care and high depersonalization. Interventions designed to foster attributes and skills such as empathy, resilience, and perception of security may be an essential step in reducing and preventing burnout.","375":null,"376":"The use of Gastrografin may have a therapeutic effect on resolving adhesive small bowel obstruction. Adhesive Small Bowel obstruction (ASBO) accounts for the majority of patients with small bowel obstruction. Most patients are managed conservatively; frequent admissions create a considerable burden. We sought to examine the adherence to the Bologna guidelines for the management of ASBO in a high volume tertiary center and whether or not Gastrografin had a therapeutic effect. A comparison was made between an initial retrospective audit looking at ASBO and a prospective re-audit after applying standards derived from the Bologna guidelines. During re-audit it was found that more patients underwent conservative management and fewer patients had surgery as first line management. In the re-audit, those who had to undergo surgery within\/after a period of 72h of conservative management were also fewer. Whether they were managed surgically primarily or after a period of conservative management, the average length of stay was also shorter. In comparison to the preliminary audit, there appeared to be no change in the way that medical history and physical examination was documented during the re-audit. However, there was a marked difference in the use of appropriate blood tests and CT scans. Changes were made successfully following the initial audit results and have been implemented, thus closing the audit loop. This study shows that the use of Gastrografin has decreased the need for surgical intervention in a group of patients with small bowel obstruction.","377":"This study is aimed to review the applications of Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) in dentistry. The increased demand for aesthetics, legislation in some developed countries, few drawbacks with existing materials and clinicians shifting their paradigms towards metal free restorations led space for the metal-free restorations in today's dental practice. An electronic literature search was conducted through Medline via PubMed, Wiley Online library, EBSCOhost, Science Direct, as well as the Google Scholar between January 2010 and March 2018 using the keywords: PEEK, modified PEEK, PEEK and Dental, advantages of PEEK, applications of PEEK in dentistry and PEEK Implants. A total of 103 articles were found in the literature search and out of these, 18 were not related to our study and hence were excluded. Finally, 85 articles were found to be relevant. PEEK has been explained for a number of applications in dental practice. The literature showed that the PEEK material has superior mechanical properties with different uses in various specialties of dentistry.","378":"","379":"[This corrects the article on p. 257 in vol. 11, PMID: 30364602.].","380":"[This corrects the article on p. 247 in vol. 11, PMID: 30364719.].","381":"[This corrects the article on p. 203 in vol. 11, PMID: 30364592.].","382":null,"383":"Background and Aim: Obesity is associated with cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes and insulin resistance. Myonectin is a myokine mostly secreted from skeletal muscles and inversely associated with obesity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercises on serum levels of myonectin and insulin resistance in obese and overweight women. Materials and Methods: Eighty obese women were assigned to exercise (34) and control groups (46). The exercise program comprised three weekly 45-minute sessions of aerobic exercise training for 8 weeks that included running with 50-70% of maximum heart rate (first 2 weeks - 50%; second week - 60%; third week - 65%; and the last 2 weeks by 70% of maximum heart rate). Twenty-four hours before and after the training session, fasting myonectin serum levels were measured. ANCOVA was used to assess differences between the groups. Results: Serum levels of myonectin in the experimental group increased significantly (P=0.000); however, insulin resistance significantly decreased in the experimental group (P=0.000). Conclusion: Therefore, considering the role of myonectin in increasing fatty acid uptake, exercise training can play an essential role in decreasing obesity-related diseases and metabolic syndrome; this effect is partly related to the roles of myonectin. Therefore, the use of this type of exercise is recommended to reduce the risk of diseases associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.","384":"Introduction: Testicular tissue is part of the reproductive system that some mineral compounds such as cadmium chloride (CdCl2) destroy. Green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract can reduce the tissue damage caused by toxins due to its antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of green tea extract on sperm quality in cadmium chloride toxicity. Materials and Methods: In the present study, male Wistar rats were allotted randomly into four groups, namely control group (C), CdCl2 (1.5mg\/kg), GT 1.5% (w\/v) and in combinationCdCl2+GT groups. CdCl2 was injected intraperitoneally (1.5 mg \/kg) whereas the green tea extract was administrated orally. At 13, 25 and 49 days after treatment, the rats were euthanized and the reproductive organs (testes, epididymis) were excised and used for sperm analysis and histo-morphometric examinations. Results: The mean of the diameter of seminiferous tubes, the number of spermatogonia, Sertoli, Leydig cells and thickness of the germinal layer in the testis were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) in all groups compared to the CdCl2 group (P&lt;0.05). Sperm motility, sperm count and testosterone were significantly decreased in the CdCl2 group compared to all groups of treatment (p&lt;0.05). The mean of MDA was significantly increased in the CdCl2 group compared to other groups (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Green tea has an antioxidant effect that reduces the effects of free oxygen radicals produced from toxins such as cadmium chloride. In addition, it could decrease lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane and ultimately prevent the destruction of tissues in the long run.","385":null,"386":null,"387":"Adherence to medical treatment in chronic patients challenging, especially in primary prevention where the benefit is not directly perceived by the patient. Through the directed interview of this qualitative study we assessed some specific factors that intervene in beta-blockers adherence in cirrhotic patients with oesophageal varices in primary prevention in Romanian. We identified that the most important modifiable extrinsic factor that influences adherence is the confidence in medicine. The intensely negative perception of the disease seemed to be another major driver of adherence.","388":"Aim &amp; Objective: Due to the importance of spiritual care as a part of holistic care, this study aimed to investigate the effect of spiritual intelligence training on the nurses' competence in spiritual care in critical care units. Methods: The study was performed on 82 nurses (40 in the experimental group and 42 in the control group). Participants were selected from critical care units of teaching hospitals affiliated to Lorestan University of Medical Sciences. The experimental group took part in eight sessions of spiritual intelligence training, held in the form of workshops. In the control group, no intervention was made. The scale for assessing nurses' competencies in spiritual care was completed before, immediately and one month after the sessions in two groups. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 15. Results: The results showed that spiritual intelligence training had a positive effect on nurses' competence in spiritual care. Also, 89% of the nurses who participated in the study had not been given any prior education regarding spiritual care. Nurses considered barriers to spiritual care including inadequate staff, cultural differences, high workload and lack of education on this subject. Conclusions: The present results showed that the training of spiritual intelligence could develop the nurses' competence in spiritual care. The development of spiritual care provided by nurses can result in various outcomes such as increased satisfaction with care in patients, reduced anxiety and symptoms of depression during hospitalization, reduced length of hospitalization and, in general, improved quality of life.","389":"We present a family in which the first child was diagnosed with dopa-responsive dystonia based on biochemical findings only. Dopa-responsive dystonia is a severe heterogeneous genetic disease. The possibly involved genes are GCH1 and TH. In their second pregnancy, the parents came for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis late, at 12 weeks of gestation. Genetic testing in the affected child was performed, but the results were difficult to interpret. The identified mutations were classified as VOUS - variants of unknown clinical significance. Although possibly causative, a homozygous variant in the TH gene was not reported before in children with dopa-responsive dystonia. Due to limited time, establishing the fetal prognosis was challenging. Our report emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the context of new diagnostic techniques, such as Next Generation Sequencing. We illustrate the fact that behind any laboratory result remains sophisticated clinical judgment. We also describe a previously not reported variant of the TH gene in a child with severe, early-onset dystonia.","390":"Background: Little evidence exists concerning students' perception of faculty incivility. Given the growing trend of incivility and the stressful nature of these behaviors, the present study aimed to investigate the level and frequency of faculty incivility as perceived by nursing students. Methods: A stratified random sample of 178 students from four nursing faculties of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences participated in the present cross-sectional study. The Incivility in Nursing Education-Revised Survey, consisting of 24 items, was used to investigate the prevalence and frequency of faculty incivility, and the mean and frequency of each item was calculated separately. The data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (chi-square, independent t-test and analysis of variance), and the significance level was set at 0.05. Results: Most of the participants were single, did not live in a dormitory, and ranged in age from 19 to 23. From their perspective, disrespect, physical threat, property damage, and physical violence were of paramount importance. 61.8% of them argued that they had \"sometimes\" and \"always\" experienced \"unfair assessment\" during the last year. Creating codes of behavior, enhancing awareness of civility, and developing and implementing policies for managing incivility were proposed as the most important strategies for improving civility. Conclusion: Faculty members should be prepared for establishing friendly and respectful relationships, effective teaching, and applying a reality-based assessment. Identifying different and prevalent kinds of faculty incivility and making faculty members aware of them paves the way for faculty members to rethink their performance.","391":"Objective: This study aimed to identify the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and ergonomic risks for Kerman University of Medical Sciences' office workers. Methods: The study sample comprised all office workers in the University and the sample included 129 women and 121 men. Data on MSDs were derived from the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, while ergonomic data were collected through two direct observations via the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) and the rapid office strain assessment (ROSA) method. Results: The results showed that the highest prevalence rates of MSDs were in the lower back (72.4%) and neck (55.2). Results of the postural assessment revealed that 68.8% of the participants' require \"further investigation in order to modify their posture\" and 27.6% need to \"modify their posture soon.\" From the workstation analysis, the majority of the office workers were at a medium (55.2%) and high-risk level (27.6%). Results also revealed a significant association between some of MSDs in the lower back and neck with the RULA and ROSA score. Conclusions: Based on the results, for the prevention of MSDs, there should be ergonomics workshops for workers to be aware of ergonomics factors in the office. The ergonomics training must also be used in offices; the design of workstations should be improved.","392":"One of the challenges faced when conducting a clinical trial is the recruitment of the proposed number of participants. Accordingly, identifying barriers to patients' enrollment and developing effective strategies to overcome them is mandatory. One of the main strategies employed to improve participation rate consists of designing the informed consent forms based on patients' feedback. This survey aims to explore the attitude of patients admitted in a Romanian tertiary cardiology center to take part in biomarker-based clinical trials. This is a descriptive, prospective and longitudinal single-center study. Participants will be recruited until the planned sample size will be reached (n=333). The patients will be interviewed based on a semi-structured questionnaire which includes four sections: demographics (7 items), personal medical history (7 items), attitudes (9 items) and trust (4 items). Descriptive statistics will be used to illustrate patients' demographics, medical history, attitudes toward biomarker-based clinical trials and trust in medical researchers. Logistic regression models will be employed to assess relations between patients' attitudes, trust, and different socio-demographic variables. Data analysis will offer answers to key questions addressed by this survey: What amount of and in what form should information be disclosed? Who should make the invitation to participate? The information gained will facilitate tailoring informed consent forms to suit the needs of patients with various demographic, social and educational backgrounds.","393":null,"394":"Rationale: In recent years, the cost of several treatment options for renal cancer have been supported by the Romanian healthcare system for both first- and second-line therapies. First-line alternatives through real-life efficacy and amplitude of adverse reactions may influence the efficacy and costs of patients treated with second-line treatment. Objective: Estimation of the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit ratio for first-line treatment alternatives: Sunitinib and Pazopanib from the payer's perspective in the Romanian healthcare system. Methods and Results: We developed a Markov model to calculate the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit ratio for 2 cohorts of patients using the results from the COMPARZ study for efficacy (progression-free survival, general survivability and quality of life) and safety and costs from national hospital databases. For an estimated population of 800 patients, Pazopanib has a quantified benefit of 7.19 years in progression-free survival, 11.71 life years gained and 8.97 years of quality-adjusted life-years compared to Sunitinib. The analysis is limited by the accuracy of the national data used and the transposition of general data on efficacy and safety at the local level.","395":"Introduction and Objective: Medical errors and adverse events are among the major causes of avoidable deaths and costs incurred on health systems all over the world.

The subjects were selected using the stratified sampling method. A total of 49 teaching hospitals in Tehran are affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences and they are divided into two groups of general and specialized hospitals. Of all, 10 general hospitals and 14 specialized hospitals were randomly selected. The required data was collected using a three-part questionnaire. Using the SPSS software (version 18), the collected data was analyzed by means of ANOVA, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and t-test and the results were reported as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. Results: According to the results of this study, the mean total number of medication errors that occurred within one month in the pediatric and emergency wards was roughly 41.9 cases, as stated by the nurses. The mean number of medication errors was higher in men than in women. Also, the two variables of gender and the type of shift work were related to medication errors; specifically, it was higher first in the evening and night shifts and then in the morning and evening shifts, respectively. Also, the number was higher in night shifts than in the morning shifts. The most common types of medication errors were: administration of the drugs at the wrong time, using a wrong technique of administration, wrong dosage, forgetting the dosage of the drug, administrating additional doses, administrating the drug to a wrong patient, and following the oral orders of physicians. On the other hand, the most common causes of medication errors in clinical wards were the following: illegible physician orders, shortage of manpower and high workload, incomplete physician orders, the use of lookalike and sound-alike drugs, absence of pharmacist\/pharmaceutical expert in the ward, lack of dosage forms appropriate for children, and lack of adequate training regarding drug therapy. Discussion and Conclusion: Considering the results of this study, it is necessary to reduce the workload and working hours of nurses, increase medical staff's awareness of the significance of medication errors, revise the existing techniques of drug prescription, and update the indices of human resource in hospitals. It is also necessary to correct the process of naming and selecting the dosage forms of drugs by the industry.","396":null,"397":null,"398":"Introduction: Tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are common among young athletes and diagnosis may be difficult especially in the young population. Therefore, finding a new method to increase the correct diagnosis is necessary. Materials and Methods: This double-blind prospective observational study was conducted on 51 patients with suspected ACL rupture. In this study, in addition to the standard protocols, the oblique-sagittal and oblique-coronal MRI were assessed and used in three different methods, including A method (orthogonal MRI protocol), B method (orthogonal MRI protocol and oblique-sagittal MRI), and C method (orthogonal MRI protocol and oblique-coronal MRI). Results: In detecting both complete and partial rupture of ACL, B method had highest diagnostic accuracy (kappa = 0.338, P=0.001), and after that, C method had acceptable accuracy (kappa = 0.292, P=0.011). In addition, in detecting a partial rupture of ACL, B method (kappa = 0.5, P&lt;0.001), and C method had acceptable accuracy (kappa = 0.361, P=0.006). Meanwhile, in detecting a complete rupture of ACL, B method had the highest diagnostic accuracy (kappa = 0.898, P&lt;0.001), and subsequently A method had significant accuracy (kappa = 0.812, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Our results showed that the evaluation of ACL rupture by oblique-sagittal MRI in addition to orthogonal MRI protocol is accurate and with high sensitivity and specificity values. It allows to find abnormal images immediately with higher accuracy in the emergency department and more critically ill patients may benefit from the advantages of this imaging protocol.","399":"Introduction: Patients under mechanical ventilation are usually in the supine position due to various arterial\/venous tubes attached to them. Although many studies emphasize the advantages of prone position for oxygenation, some studies enumerate its disadvantages. Objective: The aim of the present research was to determine the effect of prone position on oxygenation of patients with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) under mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Methods: The present study is a single-group clinical trial (pretest-posttest), which was performed in 2017 in Ahvaz, Iran. The population of the study included 58 patients with ARF under Mechanical Ventilation (MV) in ICU in the Golestan Hospital of Ahvaz City. Patients were asked to lie in a supine position for 2 hours, and their physiological signs were measured twice at one-hour intervals. Arterial Blood Gas was tested at the end of the second interval. Afterward, they lied in the prone position and their physiological signs were again measured twice at one-hour intervals and Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) was tested at the end of the second interval. Collected data were statically analyzed by SPSS v.22. Findings: The prone position had a significant relation to Oxygen Arterial Blood (Sao2) and Pressure of Arterial Oxygen (pao2), (p-value&lt;0.05). Also, on days one and two, there was no significant relationship between the prone position and physiological signs; however, this relation was significant on day three (p-value&lt;0.05).

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of methamphetamine abuse in Iranian students using the meta-analysis method on studies conducted in Iran. Materials and Methods: To select the studies, a systematic search was performed on leading databases, including ISI web of science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO and PROSPERO with no language limits from their inception to 31 Jan 2018. Furthermore, local databases, including SID, Magiran, and IRANDOC were searched systematically using both Persian and English languages from their inception to 31 Jan 2018. Results: We found a total of 828 potentially relevant studies, of which 30 met our criteria, and 7 articles (7452 students, 3063 females and 4389 males) were included. The pooled prevalence of methamphetamine use in Iranian students was 0.016% (95% CI: 0.06-0.041, P=0.00). The heterogeneity was low (I2 =44.41, d.f = 6), which shows that about 94.41 of the total observed variance was true variance between the studies. Conclusion: Although the prevalence of methamphetamine in high-school students is lower than in other drugs, a growing pattern in Iranian high-school students in recent years is a serious warning to authorities and families. Increasing families and students' knowledge about the harmful effects of this drug can be an effective approach to reducing its prevalence in young people, especially high-school students.","402":"","403":"Introduction: The escalating rate of old people with a functional impairment in Iran and the weakness of the family support due to the diminishing of family size have increased the demand for long-term care for the elderly with cognitive impairment (CI).

Therefore, much effort has been made to find new effective compounds from plant extracts. The aqueous extract of the internal layer of oak fruit (jaft) contains antioxidants and tannins; it has many desirable properties such as inhibition of the growth of pathogens. In this study, the preventing effect of Jaft extract on stomach ulcers induced by stress was investigated. Matherials and Methods: The effect of the extract on the prevention of gastric ulcer was investigated using a variety of methods including pH measurement, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and histological methods. Rats were randomly divided into six groups. Five groups were gavage fed with different concentrations of Jaft extract, ranitidine and normal saline. The sixth group was gavage fed with normal saline as the control group. Ranitidine and normal saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test using SPSS version 18.0. Results: It was revealed that the average thickness of the mucous glands and mucosal folds in the groups receiving the extract (250, 500 and 750 mg\/kg) did not significantly decrease when compared with the situation of the control group (p&lt;0.05). However, the average nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the control group meaningfully decreased in comparison with groups receiving the extract (250, 500 and 750 mg\/kg). The average pH in groups receiving the extract and ranitidine significantly increased compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Jaft extract contains abundant polyphenolic compounds and tannins and has several biological properties such as pharmacological properties, antioxidant activity, and inhibition of lipid oxidation.

Early diagnosis, treatment and prevention are crucial in helping to diminish the incidence, mortality and morbidity associated with skin cancers. Objective: This article presents arguments for and against local anesthesia in the treatment of skin cancers, including the clinical cases, a summary of treatment, and prognosis. Methods and results: Under local anesthesia, local and loco-regional flaps offer an optimal shape and volume for face reconstruction, minimizing the operative time and therefore the hospitalization. Facial skin cancer surgery under local anesthesia also contributes significantly to decreasing health care costs compared to general anesthesia. Discussions: Although in our practice, excision of skin tumors in the facial area under local anesthesia is a frequent and harmless surgical method, it can cause increased stress in some patients. However, the benefits are significantly greater than the disadvantages.","410":"Healthcare marketing extended in a surprising way, being indispensable to any healthcare unit that wishes to carry out its work by focusing on the needs and desires of patients. In the context of the medical activity taking more and more a commercial direction, the perception of the public about the profession of a physician should be considered, a perception which can be very easily negatively influenced by unethical marketing strategies. The notion of reputation refers to the perception of a group of people over a person or an entity, based on several criteria. These criteria have evolved over time with society and its needs. A company's reputation plays a significant role because it is a key element in determining the success or failure of a company, regardless of the size of the business, be it a small company or a multinational. The first factor from which the building of a reputation starts is the relationship between the company and the client, namely the medical unit and the patient. Online reputation plays a determining role in establishing and maintaining a relationship with current or potential patients. Increasing the number of people who interact directly or indirectly with that company leads to increased brand visibility and an effective digital promotion. The Internet has made it easier for consumers to give a review or to comment on something. Thus, we can see a growing trend of people who rely on such reviews. An increasing number of patients choose to rely on existing assessments of doctors or clinics when it comes to making a decision regarding the choice of a medical service. In fact, more and more patients are looking for a doctor and choosing him \"on the internet\". The Internet has opened the way for new opportunities in healthcare marketing. Social networks are frequented daily by millions of users worldwide, so digital media is the direction that all companies are taking when planning their marketing strategies.","411":"","412":"Service quality of healthcare organizations is more and more determined by the patients' satisfaction data. Therefore, the fairness of this comparison raises questions. The factors that could affect it are represented by the demographic characteristics of patients but also the institutional characteristics of the healthcare organization. In this study, we will analyze the demographic factors. 150 questionnaires were analyzed, completed by the patients of an obstetrics-gynecology clinic in order to complete an observer study. Observing the differences between the demographic aspects of the patients, we decided to analyze them using a few satisfaction scores that were built on the answers received on the basis of the questionnaire. Each satisfaction score was attributed to a category of satisfaction surveyed between patients, and its interpretation was based on the answers received and the number of questions. The analysis of the results has shown the existence of many correlations observed in the study, based on the built-up scores, the demographic data of the patients (background, age category, level of education, monthly income level, civil status, gynecological consultation objective, sex of the gynecologist) and the way the patients were informed and their general impression.","413":"Introduction: the hydatic disease, caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus, is a serious disease, potentially lethal, which can be found anywhere in the world, but especially in endemic areas such as the Mediterranean Basin, Australia, New Zealand, North Africa, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Middle East and South America. The hydatic cyst is mainly found in the liver (75% of the cases), being asymptomatic in most cases and discovered accidentally on a routine abdominal ultrasound or an ultrasound performed for diagnosing other pathologies. The hepatic hydatid cyst therapy is multimodal, including medical, surgical, and, lately, minimally invasive techniques. Materials and methods: 88 patients were diagnosed with liver hydatid cyst at the General Surgery Clinic of the Colentina Hospital in Bucharest where they were admitted from January 2014 to July 2017. Data collection was realized by consulting the patients' observation sheets, followed by organizing a database of clinical, paraclinical and treatment parameters. Age, gender, place of origin, year and duration of admission, symptoms and signs at admission, paraclinical serological tests relevant for liver function and E. granulosus infection, imaging investigations performed and their results, type of treatment received and post-treatment progress with the complications that occurred were taken in account. Results: some of the results of the study showed some differences comparing to the data from specialty literature, the possible causes being the small number of patients, the paraclinical examinations that were not sufficiently detailed to allow the study of a phenomenon in all its complexity, the lack of information from the patients' first presentation to a doctor or from their previous admissions. Conclusions: patients with hepatic hydatid cyst form a heterogeneous group, semiology being poor and unspecific. Among the laboratory examinations, eosinophilia is a sign of concern but is present in less than half of the patients. Imaging findings are the basis for the diagnosis of hepatic hydatid cysts. Surgical treatment remains the \"gold standard\" in therapy, but minimally invasive methods with high applicability, less frequent complications and lower hospital requirements are starting to gain ground.","414":"Primary gastric lymphoma (PGL) represents a rare pathology, which can be easily misdiagnosed because of unspecific symptoms of the digestive tract. Histologically, PGL can vary from indolent marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) to aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). During the years, clinical trials revealed the important role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the pathogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is an influential promoter of gastric lymphomagenesis initiation. Long-term studies revealed that eradication therapy could regress gastric lymphomas.","415":"Hypothesis: How are the epidemiologic repartition and the physiopathology of lung cancer (LC) in Algeria? Objective: Our study aimed to establish the clinico-epidemiological profile and evaluate redox imbalance in Algerian patients with LC. Methods and results: Our study concerned 94 Algerian patients with LC treated at two hospitals of Algiers, the capital of Algeria. The clinico-epidemiological profile was established. Moreover, the redox imbalance was evaluated by dosing oxidative stress (OS) parameters in tumor tissues and blood. We noted that the average age was 62.06 years, and 79 among the 94 patients were male, 94.59% of which were smokers. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (45.45% of cases), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (37.88%) small-cell carcinoma (4.86%) and other histological types (6.67%), while the most frequent clinical stage was IV (66.95 %). 23 of the 94 patients were exposed to particular risk factors such as masonry products, metal mechanics, coal smoke and so forth. In other respects, the OS parameters: NO (Nitrogen monoxide), AOPP (Advanced Oxidation Protein Products) and MDA (Malondialdehyde) were higher in tumor tissues compared to peritumoral stroma (control), unlike the catalase activity. Otherwise, AOPP and MDA were significantly higher in patients' blood than in healthy control blood, in contrast to the catalase activity. Discussion: The LC has a heterogeneous repartition regarding the sex, age, histological types, the smoking status and professional exposition to risk factors in the Algerian population. Moreover, the oxidative stress impacts the physiopathology of LC.","416":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol consumption (&lt;40 g\/week). The essential metabolic trait is insulin resistance, which is why NAFLD is associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia. Approximately one-quarter of adults with NAFLD present nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) leading to progressive hepatic fibrosis and finally cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. If liver biopsy (LB) has traditionally been NAFLD's gold standard, over the past 15 years, its use has undergone an important transformation. In this review, the role of noninvasive tests (serological markers, imaging techniques) in the NAFLD evaluation is analyzed, starting from the low adherence of patients for LB, the complications of the technique, and the increased cost. LB is the only investigation that distinguishes between simple steatosis and NASH. However, in the medical practice, LB has gained lesser value; it is worth mentioning that NASH represents a small proportion compared to NAFLD. For this reason, most patients only show biopsy steatosis, which has a good prognosis. In addition, judging by the appearance of inflammation markers and fibrosis in the diagnosis technique, the use of LB has become increasingly rare in the definition of NASH.","417":"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method used worldwide to make causality-based inferences about brain-behavior interactions, assess cortical reactivity, and map functionally relevant brain regions inducing a controlled current pulse in a specific cortical area. Clinical applications of TMS have shown promising results in the treatment of a vast number of psychiatric and neurological conditions such as headache disorders - migraine being one of the most encountered. In patients with migraine, the pharmacologic therapy is divided in urgent\/ abortive treatment of the attack and prophylactic one. As first-line drugs simple analgesics and non-steroidal inflammatory are preferred. Nevertheless, many individuals continue to have attacks refractory to various prophylactic and\/or abortive therapies, while others are at high risk of developing medication overuse headache. Among non-pharmacologic therapies TMS has been broadly studied as a preventive migraine treatment with good outcome results.

The aim of this study was to examine the role of the consumers' emotional satisfaction in health care services. More exactly, the study investigated the role of emotional satisfaction in two directions: as a consequence of perceived functional quality and as a precursor of the consumers' behavioral intentions, such as loyalty and WOM, integrated into a conceptual model. The sample size was of 100 respondents, health care consumers of a private medical organization. The sampling method consisted of quota sampling, suggesting that each fifth individual received a questionnaire. The demographic profile of the health care consumers was determined in SPSS version 21 and the model was validated in SmartPls version 3, using the Structural Equation Modeling. Most of the respondents (51%) were male, from urban residential area (56%) and were aged between 28 and 37 years (40%). In terms of education, the vast majority had university degrees (47%), with their revenue between 2600-3000 RON (27%), married (51%) and who visited the doctor because of routine check-ups (47%).

Materials and Methods: Clinical evaluation, mammography, breast ultrasound and breast MRI were used for the assessment of the mastectomy skin flaps which enhanced the selection of the adequate surgical technique for breast reconstruction. The evaluation started with the skin flap measurement of 50 patients with breast cancer, who were candidates for modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in 2014, using the above-mentioned methods, without immediate breast reconstruction. Consequently, 46 nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM) and 21 skin-sparing mastectomies (SSM) with immediate breast reconstruction with implants were performed between 2014 and 2017 after having such a preoperative subcutaneous tissue thickness evaluation. Results: The intraoperative findings of the MRM group showed a 90% accuracy for the MRI preoperative evaluation, 87% for the ultrasound, 81% for the mammography and 71% for the pinch test. The preoperative measurements for the patients undergoing SSM or NSM were a criterion for choosing the surgical technique for breast reconstruction. The rate of postoperative complications was low. Conclusion: Preoperative clinical measurements, breast ultrasound, breast MRI and mammography can enhance the prediction of the skin flap thickness and thus lead to a low rate of complications and good aesthetic results in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction.","423":"Introduction. Conventional treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is often disappointing. As a result, some of these patients seek salvation in traditional and complementary medicine (T&amp;CM). The aim of this study is to describe how many patients with MS use T&amp;CM and what their motives and expectations are in doing so. Methods. Ninety-nine patients with diagnosed MS, attending the service of ambulatory revalidation of the National Clinic for Multiple Sclerosis in Melsbroek (Belgium) were included in February 2004 in this retrospective study. All patients had MS resulting in motoric or psychosocial symptoms. The disability was not quantified for this study. Participants were interviewed by means of a structured questionnaire on their current treatment of MS including T&amp;CM. Results. In total 44% of the participants had experiences with T&amp;CM. The most frequently used T&amp;CM were homeopathy and acupuncture. Participants using conventional treatment were more satisfied with the support (p=0.006) and the treatment outcome (0.018) than T&amp;CM users. The use of T&amp;CM was not related to gender, education, living conditions, causal treatment such as disease modifying-therapy (DMT), grade of disability or subtype of the disease. Conclusion. Patients diagnosed with MS seek hope in T&amp;CM such as homeopathy or acupuncture. The results of this study suggest that MS patients need more professional support in their personal search for alternative therapies. Key point. 50% of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis search relief in traditional and complementary medicine such as homeopathy or acupuncture. These patients often feel compelled to try every opportunity to heal, often stimulated or urged on by friends or relatives. Multiple sclerosis patients are more satisfied with their conventional treatment than with the traditional and complementary medicine.","424":"Rationale. In recent years, significant advances have been made on the subject of MRI examination techniques, which have opened new avenues of research regarding the spinal involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Objective. Our objective was to compile and analyze the available literature data, concerning the MRI of the cervical spine in ALS, detailing the metrics and their significance in diagnosis and follow-up. Methods and results. We have conducted an extensive search on the subject using literature data published over the last fifteen years, correlating it with our own experience. In ALS, there is a permanent interest in developing new biomarkers that might be sensitive to spatial and temporal patterns of neurodegeneration, which will permit early diagnosis and hopefully lead to new therapeutic approaches. Both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and spinal cord morphometry (especially spinal atrophy) reflect different aspects of the disease and correlate with clinical deterioration. Newer approaches like inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMTR) and multiparametric analysis seem to have better sensitivity, are more appropriate for follow-up, and lend themselves to prognostic conclusions. Discussion. We conclude that MRI is a constantly expanding field, a unique non-invasive tool with immense potential in evaluating the in vivo evolution of the neurodegenerative ALS process, both structurally and functionally, with high hopes for the future.

The working hypothesis is that particular SNPs may predispose to an accelerated disease course and more comorbidities in psoriasis patients. Methods:This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2016 in the Dermatology Department of \"Elias\" University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest and included 82 psoriasis patients. Several clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded, and the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) was noted. Using real-time PCR, we tested for the following SNPs: rs361525, rs1800629, rs1800896, rs610604, rs17782313. Results:Disease severity was not significantly influenced by any of the five studied SNPs. Gene polymorphism of rs17782313 was found to influence the occurrence of psoriatic arthritis. In these patients, rs610604 and rs17782313 polymorphisms were associated with the presence of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, rs17782313 influenced the presence of obesity, heterozygotes being more at risk. Our data suggested that MetS occurred independently of the five studied SNPs. Discussion.The influence of certain cytokine gene polymorphisms on multiple organ systems is justification enough for further analysis of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of metabolic syndrome development in psoriasis patients. Abbreviations:single-nucleotide polymorphisms - SNPs, metabolic syndrome - MetS.","432":"Introduction:Health volunteers are employed to execute governmental health promotion programs in most countries around the world. The present study aimed to assess the challenges of health volunteers program to provide a better understanding of the present situation. Methods:This study was conducted using a qualitative approach. 14 participants were selected purposively selected from two comprehensive health care centers in the southwest of Iran.

Thus, managerial support and precise planning seem to be necessary for facing these challenges.","433":"Rationale.Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms that develop from the endocrine tissues of the pancreas. They have a better overall prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, all commonly used classification systems reflect a separation between more indolent, well-differentiated tumors and far more aggressive poorly differentiated types that behave clinically more like small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Objective.To present the case of a 62-year-old man with an aggressive pancreatic NET, with liver, splenic and bone metastases who underwent multidisciplinary treatment including several lines of chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs and radiotherapy. Methods and Results.The patient is a smoker and an occasional drinker, known with type two diabetes mellitus (DM), receiving insulin therapy. He was diagnosed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in January 2015 with a locally invasive pancreatic body mass, intraabdominal adenopathies and liver nodules, suggestive of metastases. Histopathological diagnosis was obtained through liver biopsy: neuroendocrine tumor with a 10-15% Ki67 proliferation index. Palliative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine was started in March 2015. In June 2015, Sandostatin LAR was added. In March 2016, he had progressive disease. Subsequently, in September 2016, bone metastasis was found within the T10 vertebra. He underwent radiotherapy for multiple bone metastases in February 2017. Progressive disease was again found during a CT examination in May 2017. His performance status has gradually worsened since then and he died in July 2017. Discussion.As a group, well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs are generally indolent malignancies with prolonged natural history. Intermediate-grade NETs have a slightly worse prognosis than low-grade tumors.

Materials and Method: The published experimental studies of our research group up to 1996, as well as results of other researchers in this field, are demonstrated and discussed. Different actions of administered substances on the anastomotic healing were compared and represented. Various chemotherapeutic agents were evaluated in experimental models without colorectal cancer as independent risk factors for the anastomotic healing. Moreover, numerous pharmaceutical agents such as steroids, immunomodulators, vasodilators and the use of fibrin glue are also assessed in detail. Results: Cytostatics, as well as steroids, impair the colonic anastomotic healing, but the combined administration of other agents can reverse this negative effect. Fibrin glue seems to protect the colonic anastomosis, while iloprost could be a potential candidate for further exploration in patient trials. Tacrolimus, despite its immunosuppressive action, seems to promote the anastomotic healing. This observation could be useful for patients with inflammatory bowel disease under tacrolimus therapy, who undergo a non-elective colectomy. Obstructive conditions predispose to anastomotic insufficiency, and therefore, substances to avoid this threatening complication are also assessed. Tacrolimus and iloprost showed a remarkable action against anastomotic leakage under artificially obstructive conditions. Conclusion: Further studies, especially in forms of clinical protocols, are necessary in order for these results to find their place in safe daily practice.","442":"","443":"To investigate the association between pernicious anemia and other autoimmune diseases.

A number of recent advances in recovery have reinforced the idea that pharmacological intervention combined with a specific rehabilitation therapy can reduce disability after stroke. Objective - The aim of this trial was to demonstrate the hypothesis that the association of pharmacological treatment with Cerebrolysin to early physical therapy can significantly stimulate the endogenous processes underlying the recovery after an ischemic stroke. Methods and Results - It was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. 60 patients were randomized either to 30 ml\/ day Cerebrolysin or to Placebo for 10 consecutive days, starting in the first 24-48 hours after stroke. The pharmacological treatment was paired with early physical rehabilitation. The robust nonparametric evaluation of the National Institute for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) demonstrated a large superiority of Cerebrolysin relative to placebo on day 10 with a MW=0.79 (95% CI, 0.65-0.94), respectively on day 30 with MW=0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.89). Similar results were found with modified Ranking Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI). Cerebrolysin was safe and well tolerated.

About half of OCD patients treated with an adequate trial of serotonin reuptake inhibitors fail to fully respond to treatment and continue to exhibit significant symptoms. Therefore, there is a need for other agents to alleviate the symptoms of these disorders. In spite of considerable research including numerous randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews, there exists uncertainty regarding what treatments are effective. In this systematic review, we evaluated the efficacy of mood stabilizers in treatment-refractory OCD. We conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials evaluating lithium, anticonvulsive agents or atypical antipsychotic drugs for OCD to determine which therapies show more effective than a placebo, in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms. We acquired eligible studies through a systematic search of Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest and Google scholar. We conducted meta-analyses to establish the effect of lithium, anticonvulsive agents, or atypical antipsychotic drugs on patient-important outcomes when possible.

However, there is insufficient data about this disease in medical literature. Aim (objective): A more extensive clarification of the IgG4 molecule, the diversified aspects of IgG4-related disease, and the response of this disease to treatment, will provide a crucial understanding of the immune system and other diseases now known to be associated with IgG4. The MEDLINE online medical database was used, and, after a comprehensive review of medical articles regarding IgG4-RD, published after 2003, using the search words \"IgG4- related disease\" and \"IgG4 molecule\", we have described the clinical, pathological and therapeutic features of IgG4-RD, as well as the presence of the IgG4 molecule in the evolution, diagnosis and management of this syndrome. We characterized the potential disease mechanisms and discussed early observations related to treatment. Given the response to immunosuppressive therapy, it is hypothesized that IgG4-related disease is most likely an autoimmune disease. Therefore, IgG4-related disease is a fibro-inflammatory condition that can affect any organ and can lead to the formation of pseudotumoral lesions requiring differential diagnosis with various malignancies.

However, the impact of this disease may be diminished by specialized or general metaphylaxis treatment. The article presents results of the analysis of different methods of metaphylaxis of recurrent urolithiasis. The implementation of metaphylaxis measures significantly reduces the rate and risk of recurrence in patients with recurrent urolithiasis. Specialized metaphylaxis treatment reduces the risk of lithiasis recurrence 5 times and general metaphylaxis - 2 times compared to the lack of metaphylaxis, which requires this treatment to prevent the recurrence of urolithiasis.","455":"Introduction: Development of new pulp capping agents has paved the way towards the preservation of pulp vitality, which is an important goal in restorative dentistry.

Novafen is a new drug which consists of Acetaminophens, Ibuprofen and caffeine and has been marketed in Iran in recent years. 70 subjects referring to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Tabriz Faculty of Dentistry, who were candidates for crown lengthening procedure, were randomly selected and included in the present study, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. No significant differences were detected in pain severity between the two groups either clinically or statistically at 30-minutes postoperative interval. Pain, discomfort, and edema are very common after dental procedures, especially after periodontal surgeries. Such conditions usually occur during the first 24-hours postoperative interval and are considered moderate to severe pains. Although in the present study, the administration of Novafen before periodontal surgery resulted in the relief of postoperative pain, further studies are recommended on the subject, The administration of Novafen before periodontal surgeries resulted in pain relief after surgery.","468":null,"469":"Coma is the state of unrousable unconsciousness. There are variations in the degree of coma and the findings and signs found on the patient's clinical examination depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. The Glasgow Coma scale evaluates the best motor, verbal and eye answers of the patient. A patient is considered to be in a coma if his Glasgow Coma Scale is below 8 points. The progress that we have made throughout the years has also led to complications that can culminate in a major catastrophe like death, permanent brain damage, coma. A study performed reached the conclusion that prior comorbidity, older age, intraoperative hypotension, and cardiovascular surgery may predispose patients to postoperative coma. The article presents a case of postoperative coma treated successfully with homeopathy. Although a rare complication, postoperative coma is a severe, death-leading condition, causing immense suffering on both the patient and the patient's family. A multidisciplinary and thorough approach is necessary for these patients, but even after a well-conducted therapy, this condition leads to the death of the patient.","470":"Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium that grows in the digestive tract and may be present in more than half of the world's population. The clinical features of Helicobacter pylori range from asymptomatic gastritis to gastrointestinal malignancy. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a low-grade B-cell marginal zone lymphoma and Helicobacter pylori has been detected in more than 75% of the patients with MALT lymphoma. Many tests for the detection of Helicobacter pylori are available, including antibody tests, urea breath tests, stool antigen tests and endoscopic biopsies. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori usually prevents the return of ulcers and ulcer complications even after appropriate medications such as PPIs are stopped. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori is important in the treatment of the rare condition of the stomach known as MALT lymphoma. The treatment of Helicobacter pylori to prevent stomach cancer is controversial. Confirmation of eradication is recommended in associated ulcers, persistent dyspepsia despite a test-and-treat approach, MALT lymphoma, and previous treatment for early-stage gastric cancer. The urea breath test and stool antigen test can be used to confirm the eradication and should be performed at least 4 weeks after the completion of therapy. Several diseases have been reported to be associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, including hematologic diseases, such as ITP, idiopathic iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency. There is a positive trend in the association between Helicobacter pylori infection and neurodegenerative disorders and new data showed a reduced risk of death due to stroke and lung cancer but an increased risk of preeclampsia in infected women, which requires further investigations.","471":"","472":"","473":"Hypothesis: Nowadays, rectal cancer is an important healthcare challenge that affects many thousands of people each year worldwide, being diagnosed especially after the age of 50 years. Objective: This study attempted to evaluate the oxidative stress in patients with rectal cancer. Methods and results: 30 patients from the \"Prof. Dr. Al. Trestioreanu\" Institute of Oncology in Bucharest were treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy during 2014 and 2016 and were included in the clinical study. Blood samples were obtained in dynamics during the treatment. From the blood samples, the serum was separated and used to identify the biochemical oxidative stress parameters. Results: Regarding the determination of lipid peroxides, albumin thiols, the cuprum oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin, the values registered in the dynamic of the treatment highlighted their increase to a maximum at the treatment's endpoint due to an important oxidative stress. Regarding the serum values for total antioxidants, the results pointed out the activation of the natural protection systems, which in time were overwhelmed, due to the installed oxidative stress. Conclusion: Part of the cytotoxic effect of radiotherapy was due to the production of oxidative stress. The cell was constantly exposed to the cytotoxic action of the reactive oxygen species. The obtained results indicated the dual relation to which the tumoral cell exposed itself and the installed oxidative stress, respectively, the oxidative stress being a cause or a consequence of the malign transformation.

Lack of local anatomy evaluation prior to this procedure might lead to the selection of an inappropriate brachytherapy applicator, increasing the risk of side effects (e.g. uterus perforation, painful procedure ...). Objective: To assess the movement of the uterus and cervix prior to brachytherapy in patients with gynecological cancer, in order to select the proper type of brachytherapy applicator. Also we wanted to promote the replacement of the plain X-ray brachytherapy with the image-guided procedure. Methods and results: We presented the case of a 41-year-old female diagnosed with a biopsy that was proven cervical cancer stage IIIB. At diagnosis, the imaging studies identified an anteverted uterus. The patient underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Prior to brachytherapy, the patient underwent a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which identified a displacement of the uterus in the retroverted position. Discussion: A great variety of brachytherapy applicators is available nowadays. Major changes in uterus position and lack of evaluation prior to brachytherapy might lead to a higher rate of incidents during this procedure. Also, by using orthogonal simulation and bidimensional (2D) treatment planning, brachytherapy would undoubtedly fail to treat the remaining tumoral tissue. This is the reason why we proposed the implementation of a prior imaging of the uterus and computed tomography (CT)\/ MRI-based simulation in the brachytherapy procedure.

Reelin acts on its receptors, VLDLR and ApoER2, acting on cytoskeleton, controlling migration and subsequently positioning and stabilizing the cortical neurons. We investigated the reelin presence and its receptors, VLDLR and ApoER2, in melanocytic nevi considering the neural crest origin of the nevus cells and their migration into skin during embrionary period. Melanocytic nevi present a strict cellular architecture and an increased malignant transforming capacity. We investigated reelin presence in 32 melanocytic nevi (5 junctional, 27 compound or 14 dysplastic nevi and 18 non dysplastic nevi). The assessment of reelin presence was performed by histological semiquantitative criteria. Results showed the presence of reelin in 29 cases (29\/ 32). The presence of reelin was elevated in junctional areas as in dysplastic nevi. VLDLR presented positive values in 16 cases (16\/ 32) and ApoER2 was weak positive in 7 cases. Reelin or its receptors was peritumorally absent. Our study showed the presence of reelin in nevus cells from cutaneous melanocytic nevi and, in these cells, only the VLDLR receptor was present in half of the cases. The significance of the reelin presence in cutaneous nevus cells may be hypothetically considered correlated with the position maintenance of the nevus cells or migration of these cells in malignant transforming situation.

The surgical treatment of nephrolithiasis is closely related to drug therapy of urinary infection, one of the reasons being the reduction of the immune status. The work is performed by evaluating the immunological status preoperatively in 58 patients with complicated lithiasis. The analysis of the status in these patients demonstrated that complicated urolithiasis results in significant changes in the immune system, these changes being expressed at the cellular and humoral level of immunity.","478":"Postpartum hemorrhage is an obstetrical emergency that represents the leading cause of maternal mortality. Severe hemorrhagic complications that could appear postpartum are the abdomino-pelvic hematomas, which result from the rupture of the pelvic vessels. We reported a very rare case of puerperal retroperitoneal subserosal hematoma of sigmoid colon following vaginal delivery, which was successfully managed by conservative methods. As far as we know, there are only a few case reports of intramural hematoma of sigmoid colon in literature, having other etiologies than vaginal delivery trauma. The particularities of the case consisted in the association of hemangiomas and the low risk thrombophilia. Diagnosis was based on the clinical exam and the paraclinical founding. Laparotomy is generally considered the last choice, in life threatening cases with hemodynamic instability, compression signs, and presence of contrast leakage on noninvasive imaging methods, but avoiding colonic resection after dissection represented the true challenge of the case.","479":"Damage of pulp tissue usually begins in the coronal pulp. Its mistreatment or its lack of on time detection determines the progressive inclusion of the whole endodontic space in its evolution, opening the way of its expansion in the surrounding tissues of the tooth, and on the marginal apical tissue. Aim. The goal of this study was to highlight that the primary endodontic lesions with secondary periodontal implication healed and bone repair was obtained due to a proper disinfection and an adequate sealing of the endodontic system. In primary endodontic lesion with secondary periodontal involvement, endodontic treatment is required in the first stage followed by specific periodontal treatment. The prognosis is good if an appropriate endodontic approach is chosen, depending on the stage of the periodontal disease and the treatment response. The identification of the etiological factors is the most important to establish the appropriate treatment. In all clinical cases selected in this article, the healing tendency was noticed after an adequate disinfection and sealing of the endodontic system.","480":"Background: Endobronchial and endotracheal metastases from extra-pulmonary solid tumors are rare. Patients and methods: We reported the case of a patient diagnosed with endobronchial and endotracheal metastases from rectal adenocarcinoma. Case report: Patient P.G., 62 years old, was diagnosed with a rectal tumor in 2011, for which, a surgical intervention was performed (pT3 pN2a M0, stage IIIB). Afterwards, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy. In September 2013, the chest CT showed 2 nodules for which, an incomplete surgical resection was done and which were histopathologically diagnosed as metastases from rectal cancer. The patient continued the treatment with chemotherapy associated with Bevacizumab and after 6 months only Bevacizumab for maintenance. In June 2015, the chest CT pointed out a nodule in the right upper lobe and the bronchoscopy highlighted a 4-5 mm lesion at the level of the right primary bronchus, whose biopsy proved the rectal origin. Afterwards, another surgical intervention was performed. Unfortunately, the postoperative chest CT revealed an intratracheal tissue mass (11\/ 7mm) and multiple metastases in the right lung. The bronchoscopy showed 2 endotracheal lesions, out of which one was biopsied (histopathological result of metastasis from rectal cancer). Despite the fact that chemotherapy was continued, other endobronchial lesions appeared. All of them were removed and the patient started radiotherapy on the tracheal area. Afterwards, she refused to continue chemotherapy. The last bronchoscopy highlighted one endobronchial and two endotracheal secondary malignant lesions. Conclusion: Endobronchial and endotracheal metastases must be taken into consideration in all the patients with a history of extra-pulmonary cancer.

This absence is felt at all levels of the healthcare system: doctor-patient relationship, doctor-patient's relatives relationship, labor relations within the medical teams and units, the management of the large hospitals and of the medical institutions from the public administration system and last, but not least, the relationships of these units and institutions with the public opinion and, particularly, with the stakeholders. This paper tackled with some of the principles and values that underlie an efficient communication, the default of which was felt in various domains of the Romanian medical life. They were analyzed from the perspective of the Romanian and international literature and the conclusions drawn might inspire proposals for the improvement of the medical education as well as for the professional development of the Romanian doctors.","482":"Rationale (hypothesis): Many studies have highlighted the vulnerabilities in medical practice due to the legislation ignorance. Therefore, developing special programs for students training is needed and has become imperative. Objective: This research aimed to identify the educational needs for the 5th year students in \"Carol Davila\" School of Dentistry in Bucharest, related to the legislation in dentistry and its area of application. Methods and results: 199 students were invited to respond to a specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire had 11 closed-response questions and the answers were statistically analyzed. The results indicated many educational needs in all the areas of investigation. Discussion: \"Carol Davila\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy is the first university in Romania that created a new discipline in the School of Dentistry, called Work Organization and Legislation in Medicine and Dentistry.","483":"There are few methods bringing several relatively recent advances in therapy of certain types of prostate cancer. Belonging to personalized therapies, they use cells (normal or pathologic) from the patient, modify and reintroduce them in the patient's body, leading to an increased efficiency against the neoplastic tissue, proving to increase the patient's lifespan and\/ or tumor progression.","484":"In autoimmune conditions affecting the central and peripheral CNS as well as in multiple sclerosis (MS), the inflammatory syndrome is present with the onset of this disease. The present paper aimed to highlight the inflammatory syndrome based on the leukergia test, the total blood viscosity test, blood filterability test as well as on other tests. The early instituting of the therapeutic plasmapheresis beneficially modified the clinical status, the biological and pathophysiological behavior of the patient's illness. Objective of the paper: The aim was to highlight the importance, advantages, and pathophysiological changes after therapeutic plasmapheresis in five cases, in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Material and method: In order to emphasize the inflammatory syndrome, the determination of leukergia assay, the total blood viscosity test and the blood filterability test were added to regular examinations, conducted on the batch of patients included in the study. Results and discussions: As a result of using therapeutic plasmapheresis, the inflammatory parameters in patients with multiple sclerosis improved beneficially as it was proven by the values of inflammatory tests before and after plasmapheresis. Conclusions: In the treatment of multiple sclerosis, plasmapheresis proved to be a medical method that significantly reduced autoimmune inflammatory \"installed\" syndrome.","485":"The article discussed the immanent problems of meta-analyses selecting a number of independent trials in homeopathy, within which, the purpose was to examine the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment. Our focus lied in clarifying that the complex effects of homeopathic treatment known from history and day-to-day practice have not been respected so far. The examination of most of the homeopathic trials showed that studies rarely account for homeopathic principles, in order to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. The main flaw was that trials reflect the point of view that the treatment with a specific remedy could be administered in a particular disease. However, homeopathy aims to treat the whole person, rather than the diseases and each case has to be treated individually with an individualized remedy. Furthermore, the commonly known events during the course of homeopathic treatment, such as \"initial aggravation\" and \"symptom-shift\" were not considered in almost all the studies. Thus, only few trials were eligible for meta-analyses, if at all. These and other factors were discussed and certain homeopathic principles were suggested to be respected in further trials. It is expected, that a better understanding of homeopathic principles would provide guidelines for homeopathic research, which are more acceptable to both homeopathy and conventional medicine.","486":"The purpose of health care marketing is to learn and understand the needs and desires of prospective patients in order to be able to meet those necessities at the highest standards. A big advantage is the targeting capability of the electronic media that has led to its being used by managers of marketing in medical institutions as means of advertisement when they develop the marketing strategies. Regarding social media, it is safe to say that there are communication platforms that can promote certain behaviours thus influencing decision-making. Through social media, people stay in touch with other people and they can provide a mean for medical institutions to permanently communicate with the existing patients or with the potential ones. In addition, social media can be used in advertising and promoting strategies, by posting information about discounts, offers and advantages of accessing the products provided by a certain institution. A study was conducted on 126 patients of a dental clinic in Bucharest. 126 new patients were selected on a period of 22 months from January 2015 until October 2016. The patients never had any treatment in this clinic and were influenced by the Internet to seek for dental care services. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the digital methods of promoting medical services, bringing new patients to a clinic. The results of the study demonstrated the need for digital methods of promoting medical care services in order to expand a business. A strategic way of thinking in this case implied attracting new patients and offering them quality health care services, which ensured their satisfaction and the probability of their recommending the health facility further. This study revealed an important role of social networking sites in promoting. This high response was probably responsible due to targeted promoting services. Almost all the new patients who completed the form will remain patients of this clinic in future.","487":"Introduction. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of primary health care differs between students enrolled in Belgian and German government-funded universities. The secondary aim of the study was to determine the factors that might explain such a difference. Methods. Participants were recruited through all Belgian and German government-funded universities. Because not all the universities agreed to participate, recruiting was also done through social media groups of the universities. An anonymous online survey was used for data collection. Results. In total, 2238 completed surveys were evaluated, of which 544 from students in Belgium and 1694 from students in Germany. In Belgium, more students had a family physician (87%) as compared to the students in Germany (73%) (p &lt; 0.001). During the two months prior to the study, 37% of the Belgian students and 35% of the German students attended a family physician (p = 0.37). More German students attended a specialist (40%) as compared to the Belgian students (24%) (p&lt;0.001). The German students also attended the emergency department more frequently (6%) as compared to their Belgian counterparts (3%) (p = 0.004). Conclusion. Belgian university students were more likely to attend a primary care physician than the German students. The health care seemed to be better organized for Belgian students and they were more satisfied with the delivered care.","488":"Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effect of rhythmic auditory stimulation on gait kinematic parameters of patients with multiple sclerosis. Subjects and Methods: In this study, 18 subjects, comprising 4 males and 14 females with Multiple Sclerosis with expanded disability status scale of 3 to 6 were chosen. Subjects were selected by available and targeted sampling and were randomly divided into two experimental (n = 9) and control (n = 9) groups. Exercises were gait with rhythmic auditory stimulation by a metronome device, in addition to gait without stimulation for the experimental and control groups, respectively. Training was carried out for 3 weeks, with 30 min duration for each session 3 times a week. Stride length, stride time, double support time, cadence and gait speed were measured by motion analysis device. Results: There was a significant difference between stride length, stride time, double support time, cadence and gait speed in the experimental group, before and after the training. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the enhancement of stride length, stride time, cadence and gait speed in favor of the experimental group. While this difference was not significant for double support time. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that rhythmic auditory stimulation is an effective rehabilitation method to improve gait kinematic parameters in patients with multiple sclerosis.","489":"Anticoagulants are frequently used medications in diverse cardiovascular diseases. Their uses highly increase the risk of bleeding from upper and lower gastrointestinal sources, whether there is a classic vitamin K antagonist or a novel oral anticoagulant. Their interruption can promote procoagulation status with different thromboembolic accidents. Discontinuation of oral anticoagulants before the elective procedures is standardized but there are no guidelines for managing bleeding lesions of upper gastrointestinal tract concomitant with anticoagulation. Also, because some of the anticoagulants are new comers, there is no specific antidote, and so their anticoagulation effect cannot be antagonized fast in order to reduce the bleeding. Therefore, the endoscopic hemostasis must be definitive and efficient. This is a short review of the current management for the bleeding lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients taking oral anticoagulants.","490":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an ailment affecting and increasing a number of people worldwide diagnosed via non-invasive imaging techniques, at a time when a minimum harm caused by medical procedures is rightfully emphasized, more sought after, than ever before. Liver steatosis should not be taken lightly even if its evolution is largely benign as it has the potential to develop into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or even more concerning, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Traditionally, liver biopsy has been the standard for diagnosing this particular liver disease, but nowadays, a consistent number of imagistic methods are available for diagnosing hepatosteatosis and choosing the one appropriate to the clinical context is the key. Although different in sensitivity and specificity when it comes to determining the hepatic fat fraction (FF), these imaging techniques possessing a diverse availability, operating difficulty, cost, and reproducibility are invaluable to any modern physician. Ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), elastography, and spectroscopy will be discussed in order to lay out the advantages and disadvantages of their diagnostic potential and application. Although imagistics has given physicians a valuable insight into the means of managing NAFLD, the current methods are far from perfect, but given the time, they will surely be improved and the use of liver biopsy will be completely removed.","491":"Post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction (post RP ED) is a major postoperative complication with a great impact on the quality of life of the patients. Until present, no proper algorithm or guideline based on the clinical trials has been established for the management of post RP ED. According to literature, it is better to initiate a penile rehabilitation program as soon as possible after surgery than doing nothing, in order to prevent and limit the postoperative local hypoxygenation and fibrosis. The results of numerous clinical trials regarding the effectiveness of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors therapy on post RP ED have made them the gold standard treatment. Encouraging results have been achieved in studies with vacuum erectile devices, intraurethral suppositories with alprostadil and intracavernosal injections, but due to their side effects, especially in the cases of intracavernosal injections and intraurethral suppositories, their clinical use was limited therefore making them a second line option for the post RP ED treatment. What should not be forgotten is that penile implant prosthesis has proven very effective, numerous studies confirming high rates of satisfaction for both patients and partners.","492":"Knowing the indolent, non-invasive nature of most types of prostate cancer, as well as the simple fact that the disease seems more likely to be associated with age rather than with other factors (50% of men at the age of 50 and 80% at the age of 80 have it [1], with or without presenting any symptom), the big challenge of this clinical entity was to determine severity indicators (so far insufficient) to guide the physician towards an adequate attitude in the clinical setting. The risk of over-diagnosing and over-treating many prostate cancer cases (indicated by all the major European and American studies) is real and poses many question marks. The present paper was meant to deliver new research data and to reset the clinical approach in prostate cancer cases.","493":"","494":"","495":"","496":"Preeclampsia represents an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The early identification of pregnant women at risk represents a priority in reducing preeclampsia complications. For a better evaluation of the importance of preeclampsia screening, a questionnaire was developed. Methods. The questionnaire based on 14 items was distributed online. The form was anonymously completed. All forms consisted of simple questions. Results. Data from 151 completed forms were collected and analyzed. The analysis revealed the importance of arterial pressure control. 15% of the responders needed hypertensive treatment in pregnancy. They were interested in completing the preeclampsia risk test (88%). Conclusions. The results suggested that preeclampsia screening and measurement of the atrial pressure may become a valuable tool for evaluating and for determining the diagnosis in question, but the possibility of emotional distress for the subjects at risk of developing the condition should be taken in consideration.","497":"Hand fractures are one of the most common causes for presenting to the emergency room. Metacarpal fractures count about 18 to 44% of all hand fractures, and are most often standalone closed injuries, without misplacement, not needing operative treatment. We present a case in which osteosynthesis with plates and screws was used to reduce two metacarpal fractures in order to allow an early motion recovery, despite the fact that a small portion of the periosteum needed to be removed. The type of fractures were misclassified according to the radiological findings, therefore the correct diagnosis was established during surgery. The results according to the radiological aspects and to the DASH score were excellent with 95% function recovery at twelve months. In this case, the use of osteosynthesis with plates and screws led to a good fracture healing without any major complications. However, there are a series of complications related to this method that should be taken into consideration. Being misled by the radiological aspects of the fractures, the most certain way to classify a metacarpal shaft fracture is through exploratory surgery, even if in most of the cases the three radiological views are enough to establish the diagnosis. Abbreviations: DASH score = Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, TAM = Total Active Motion, MCP = metacarpal phalangeal joint, PIP = proximal inter phalangeal joint.","498":"Burn wounds are a global public health problem, which affects all countries, no matter the development stage and occurs in all age groups, from toddlers to elderly. In spite of burns being the cause of numerous household and work accidents, there are still no clear stated unanimous rules for their treatment. Every day new products appear on the market, each of them trying to prove more effective. Since ancient times, silver has been known for its antimicrobial properties, so it has been used for a long time in the treatment of burns and other types of wounds. One of the relatively modern methods of treatment is applying silver sheets on the scald lesions. In this paper, which was part of a larger study (research for a PhD thesis), concerning prevention and treatment of the post-burn pathological scars, the cases of some patients with burns, who were treated by using the above mentioned method were presented and analyzed. The results obtained by applying silver sheets were then commented and interpreted, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages compared to silver sulfadiazine creams and ointments, which have already been used at a large scale. The prevention and treatment of post-burn pathological (hypertrophic and keloid) scars is a field in which still little is known and in which there are also no clearly set therapy plans. We hope that through this research and the following ones we will manage to establish some major guidelines concerning the prevention of pathological scars, which are not only disabling, but also a major aesthetic issue for any patient, in order to obtain better outcomes.","499":"In the context of the European political and socio-economic changes of the early 90s, health care reform in Romania has become inevitable, both for patients and for health professionals in the system. The first stage of the health care reform in Romania is focused on decentralization and improving primary health care. The Romanian medical system is currently in the process of changing the mentality, which requires time, patience, and perseverance, despite the unforeseeable or resistance inevitably faced. It is a commonly known and recognized fact that in this painful period of transition, Romanian medicine, like other fields too, has traveled a winding road, with obstacles (medical malpractices, scandals in the press related to the misappropriation of funds or underfunding of the public health system, etc.) often hard to overcome.","500":"True umbilical cord knot appears to be a relatively common complication that occurs in 0.3%-1.3% of all pregnancies and it is correlated with an increased incidence of SGA infants, premature birth, need for neonatal intensive care and fetal death. The aim of the article was to evaluate the incidence of the true umbilical cord knot in the University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, for a period of 5 years and its association with premature birth, low birth weight, low Apgar score at 1 minute and the need for neonatal intensive care. By reviewing the total number of women who delivered in this unit between January 1st 2011 and December 31st 2015, the percentage of the diagnosis antepartum and intrapartum, the outcome of these pregnancies, and the reflection of this condition on the fetal status, were evaluated. During 5 years, 133 (0.71%) of 18.500 deliveries were diagnosed with true umbilical cord knot, only 16 (0.08%) cases were diagnosed by ultrasound antepartum. The mean maternal age was 34.3 years. About 30% of the studied cases (39) presented this condition at the third delivery or more. A personal history for diabetes corresponded to 27 cases (20.3%). From our database, it resulted that only 12 fetuses (10.5%) required neonatal intensive care and presented an Apgar score lower than 7 at 1 minute. Prenatal diagnosis of a true umbilical cord knot is rarely encountered and sonography skills are needed. Complementary methods such as color Doppler and 3D HD Flow are reliable for the diagnostic when true umbilical cord knots are suspected after a 2D scan. Several risk factors can guide the expectancy, such as advanced maternal age, polyhydramnios, multiparty or diabetes.","501":"The article represents a case of a young patient with atypical clinical and paraclinical presentation of vertebral artery dissection by multiple cerebral infarcts, localized at the supratentorial and infratentorial levels in the posterior circulation. A case of a 21-year-old man, without a history of trauma in the cervical area or at the cranial level, without recent chiropractic maneuvers or practicing a sport, which required rapid, extreme, rotational movements of the neck, was examined. He presented to the emergency room with nausea, numbness of the left limbs, dysarthria, and incoordination of walking, with multiple objective signs at the neurological examination, which revealed right vertebral artery subacute dissection after the paraclinical investigations. The case was particular due to the atypical debut symptomatology, through the installation of the clinical picture in stages, during 4 hours and by multiple infarcts through the artery-to-artery embolic mechanism in the posterior cerebral territory.

Though the clinical appearance suggested a benign pathology, the histopathological exam of the resection piece showed multicentric early gastric carcinoma, signet ring cell type. At the patient's request, total gastrectomy was not performed, a conservative solution being chosen instead. Superior digestive endoscopy with biopsy and oncological dispensarization was performed one month after surgery, then at every 6 months. After 2 years of benign results, the histopathological exam revealed the presence of malign singlet ring cells in the bioptic specimen. Respecting the patient's option of preserving a good quality of life, subtotal gastrectomy with Pean type gastroenteroanastomosis was performed followed by postoperatory chemotherapy. Endoscopic and oncological follow-up were performed at every six months for another 3 years (up to present), and the evolution was favorable with no local or metastatic recurrence. Histopathological examination was of great help in the surgical management of this case, allowing a fortunate early diagnosis, a conservative surgical approach, and the preserving of a good quality of life.","503":"The objective of the two case reports was to discuss the pathogenesis, origin, and therapeutic options for vallecular cysts. Method of Study. 2 children diagnosed in our department were treated by transoral endoscopic surgery, using cold instruments, suspension laryngoscopy and the operating microscope. Results. Both cases presented breathing and deglutition problems at diagnosis. The surgery aimed the complete excision, with cold instruments, via transoral access. No complications occurred and the postoperative healing was uneventful. No recurrences were observed on the long-term follow-up. Conclusion. Clinical, imagistic, and surgical data support the thyroglossal duct origin of vallecular cysts (base of tongue variant) and the complete excision is required to obtain long lasting cure.","504":"Peritonitis is the main complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and also an important factor for raising the cost of the method to the level of hemodialysis. Associated with PD, peritonitis is responsible for the increase of morbidity and mortality of the procedure and, at the same time, the main cause of the technique failure. Severe and prolonged peritonitis or repeated episodes of peritonitis lead to ultrafiltration failure. Peritonitis treatment should aim for a rapid remission of inflammation in order to preserve the peritoneal membrane functional integrity. The treatment of PD peritonitis consists mainly of antibiotic therapy, surgical intervention not being usually required. However, it is of outmost importance to differentiate the so-called \"catheter related\" peritonitis from secondary peritonitis due to visceral lesions, in which the surgical treatment comes first. The confusion between secondary and \"catheter related\" peritonitis may lead to serious errors in choosing the correct treatment, endangering the patient's life. The differential diagnosis between a refractory or secondary peritonitis in a peritoneal dialyzed patient may be very difficult. In front of a refractory PD peritonitis, surgical exploration must not be delayed. Also we have to keep in mind that the aim of peritonitis treatment is the saving of the peritoneal membrane and not the catheter.","505":"Paraovarian cysts are a rare pathology, constituting 10-20% of the adnexal masses. The origin can be represented by paramesonephric ducts (Hydatid cysts of Morgagni), vestiges of mesonephric ducts also represented by mesothelium, or neoplastic (cystadenomas or cystadenofibromas) that are mostly benign. Borderline or malignant paraovarian tumors are encountered less often. This article presents a case of paraovarian cyst in a 37-year-old patient, with a history of 2 pregnancies, completed by cesarean. The patient sought medical attention for an asymptomatic voluminous ovarian cyst, detected in a routine ultrasound scan. Laboratory tests and tumor markers were within normal limits. Transvaginal ultrasound and color Doppler revealed a cystic adnexal mass with 10 cm transonic, smooth, homogeneous content, avascular walls with no internal papillary projections, with a \"hyperechoic line\" sign of delimitation from the ovarian capsule, mostly visible when the adnexa was mobilized. The diagnostic and curative laparoscopic surgery was successful, followed by a quick recovery. The histopathological exam confirmed the benignity and the origin of the paraovarian cyst. The case was discussed in the context of the literature review concerning this pathology, drawing attention to the real possibility of differentiating ovarian from paraovarian cysts by ultrasound.","506":"Diabetes mellitus modifies the expression of adenosine receptors in the brain. Caffeine acts as an antagonist of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors and was shown to have a dose-dependent biphasic effect on locomotion in mice. The present study investigated the link between diabetes and locomotor activity in an animal model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, and the effects of a low-medium dose of caffeine in this relation. The locomotor activity was investigated by using Open Field Test at 6 weeks after diabetes induction and after 2 more weeks of chronic caffeine administration. Diabetes decreased locomotor activity (total distance moved and mobility time). Chronic caffeine exposure impaired the locomotor activity in control rats, but not in diabetic rats. Our data suggested that the medium doses of caffeine might block the A2A receptors, shown to have an increased density in the brain of diabetic rats, and improve or at least maintain the locomotor activity, offering a neuroprotective support in diabetic rats.

The study group included 20 patients with lateral bulbar infarction, 14 men, and 6 women aged between 21 and 80 years, the mean age being 56, 9 years, who were enrolled in the study in the period 2012 and 2014, following the admission in the National Institute of Neurology and Neurovascular Diseases. All the patients enrolled in this stage study, performed brain MRI - in the Medinst laboratory, which included the following sequences T1, T2, Flair, DWI, MRI angiography without contrast agent (3D TOF combined with MIP). The study was retrospective. Following the analysis of the 3D TOF sequences combined with MIP, it was found that in the group studied, 8 patients had damage at the level of the vertebral artery, 2 at the level of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and 10 patients presented mixed lesions of both the vertebral artery and of the PICA artery. In terms of the mechanism involved, most of the lateral bulbar infarctions were generated by arterial dissection (9 cases) and 6 cases had atheroma as etiology. Regarding the risk factors, dyslipidemia and smoking predominated in the studied group and the most common signs and symptoms were gait abnormalities, the ataxia of the limbs, dysphonia, and Horner syndrome.

Children diagnosed with spastic quadriplegia show a variety of symptoms in different areas: sensorimotor, emotional, cognitive, and social. The purpose of this study was to assess the functional status in patients diagnosed with spastic quadriplegia, who followed a complex medical rehabilitation program, during a year, and highlight the importance of using physical and kinetic techniques in improving their status. A total of 10 children diagnosed with spastic quadriplegia were included in the study and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and manual ability classification system (MACS) were used to evaluate the functionality status of each patient. Every patient was evaluated initially (T1), after six months of program (T2), and after they completed the study. All the children were originally monitored daily, for 5 days per week for a period of one month, then two times a week for a year. A statistically significant difference regarding the modification of the GMFCS and MACS stage was found, which occurred between the first and the third evaluation. The inverse correlation of the statistical significance between the ages of patients and the decrease in GMFCS or MACS stage was highlighted; the younger the patient, the more the scale decreased. A direct link between the gross motor function and the manual ability was noticed. Applying a complex rehabilitation program has proven efficient by improving both the gross motor functionality and the manual ability.","509":"In recent years, intense efforts have been made to clarify the pathogenesis of urolithiasis, which affects more than 10% of the population of developed countries. Currently, a number of studies have assumed a key role in the pathogenesis of oxalate urolithiasis, which is the most common one that belongs to the active forms of oxygen generated in the kidney, as a result of the activation of free radical oxidation that occurs in the interaction of calcium oxalate crystals with renal tubular epithelial cells. In the current work, oxidant and antioxidant status were assessed in the blood of patients with complicated urolithiasis pre - and post surgery. The surgical treatment of complicated urolithiasis leads a decrease of the oxidative stress and an increase in the potential of antiradical and antiperoxidative protection.","510":"The objective of this study was to determine the compared results of both the reconstruction surgery and the amputation in severe crushing of the foot, which led to open fractures. The type of study. Prospective. Background. Two major trauma hospitals (Floreasca Clinical Emergency Hospital and \"Bagdasar Arseni\" Clinical Emergency Hospital) from the university center in Bucharest. Patients. 21 patients, who sustained crushing of the foot with resulting Gustilo type III open fractures, were involved. The exclusion criteria were represented by open fractures that had very gross destructions of the neurovascular bundle, for which the amputation was the only solution, with no modality to reconstruct whatsoever. Treatment. An immediate amputation (at 24, 48 hours after a thorough debridement, proper patient resuscitation, and detailed imaging investigation - the technique of delayed emergency) and reconstruction surgery were performed. Methods of evaluation. Three variables were used: the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) score, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the residual pain and the number of rehospitalizations for secondary surgical procedures. Results. When comparing the two lots of patients, first in which the amputation patients were included and second in which the reconstruction patients were included, it was noticed that there was a less favorable prognostic in the second lot for a three-year follow up period. Conclusions. The patients with a mangled foot, in which reconstruction surgery of the bone and soft tissue envelope was performed, had a worse prognostic than those who had an amputation as a first intention.

The early recognition of the etiology of these foot lesions is essential for the therapeutic decision in order to achieve a good functional result. Several surgical procedures involving the foot have been developed in order to promote healing and avoid complications. Traditionally, surgery has been performed in an open way. The literature regarding the performance and efficacy of classical osteotomies and arthrodesis is inconsistent. This can be attributed to several variables, such as differences in patient clinical aspects and the panel of surgical techniques utilized. As with other surgical specialties, fluoroscopic imaging and minimally invasive tools are now being incorporated in these procedures. The use of high speed burrs associated with specialized osteosynthesis implants, offers several advantages over classical techniques. The ability to associate these gestures to complex protocols is beginning to be currently developed. The respect for the soft tissues is considered one of the first advantages. Despite the limited time since they were introduced in clinical practice, functional results seemed to be consistent, supporting the use of this technology.","512":"Cancer immunotherapy involves the use of therapeutic modalities that determine a manipulation of the immune system by using immune agents such as cytokines, vaccines, cell therapies and humoral, transfection agents. Immunotherapy of cancer has to stimulate the host's anti-tumor response by increasing the effector cell number and the production of soluble mediators and decrease the host's suppressor mechanisms by inducing tumor killing environment and by modulating immune checkpoints. Immunotherapy seems to work better in more immunogenic tumors. Making a review of literature, the article presents the new immunologic treatments in cancers less presented in the latest conferences, cancers in which, immunotherapy is still under investigation. Bladder cancer was the first indication for which immunotherapy was used in 1970. A promising clinical research in bladder cancer is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although breast cancer is considered immunologically silent, several preclinical and clinical studies suggested that immunotherapy has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Cervical cancer, brain cancer, head and neck cancer and colorectal and esophageal cancers are cancer types for which new immune-based cancer treatments are currently under development. Recent agents used in clinical trials will be described in before mentioned cancers.","513":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, chronic metabolic disease, presents a heterogeneous etiology, with risk factors at the social level and behavioral, environmental, and genetic susceptibility.

Methods:: Medical files of 155 patients (132M\/ 23F) with urinary bladder cancer treated between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range: 19-85 years). Disease free survival (DFS) for patients with complete tumor resection receiving adjuvant treatment and progression free survival (PFS) for patients with post-operative residual disease was estimated. Results:The distribution of the stage disease was: 50 patients (32.2%) stage II, 47 (30.3%) stage III, 58 (37.4%) stage IV. Radical cystectomy was performed in 56 patients (36.1%), while 99 patients (63.9%) underwent repeated transurethral resection of the urinary bladder tumor (TURBT). Postoperative treatment included multimodal therapy in 47 patients (30.3%) (chemotherapy and external beam radiation), external beam radiation alone in 57 patients (36.8%) and chemotherapy alone (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin-MVAC or gemcitabine+platinum) in 51 patients (32.9%). After a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 3-79 months), 51 patients (32.9%) presented local recurrence, 32 patients (21%) distant recurrence (metastases), 10 patients (6.4%) both local and distant recurrence, and 62 patients (40%) were free of disease. The median duration until progression was 27 months. Discussion:Despite the combined therapy approaches, urinary bladder carcinoma remains an aggressive disease, with a high relapse rate. Earlier diagnosis, aggressive radical surgery in intention to cure (cystectomy), and adjuvant multimodal treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) are needed for survival improvement.","518":"Post treatment periapical periodontitis is usually caused by residual microbes, due to poorly treated root canals and microleakage.

Genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors are considered responsible for the presence of androgenetic alopecia. Recent literature reports have proved the presence of inflammation and also of oxidative stress at the level of dermal papilla cells of patients with androgenetic alopecia Objective:We have considered of interest to measure the oxidative stress parameters in the blood of patients with androgenetic alopecia Methods and results:27 patients with androgenetic alopecia and 25 age-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total thiols levels were measured on plasma samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) activities, and also non protein thiols levels together with TEAC activity were determined on erythrocytes samples No statistically significant changes were observed for TEAC erythrocytes, non-protein thiols, GPx and CAT activities. Significantly decreased (p&lt;0.01) SOD activity was found in patients with androgenetic alopecia. For plasma samples decreased TEAC activity (p&lt;0.001), increased MDA levels (p&lt;0.001) and no change in total thiols concentration were found in patients when compared with the controls. Discussions:Decreased total antioxidant activity and increased MDA levels found in plasma samples of patients with androgenetic alopecia are indicators of oxidative stress presence in these patients.

","520":"In intensive care settings, blood lactate level measurement proved to be an excellent predictor of outcomes. In patients requiring less urgent treatment, the arterial blood lactate is less sensitive and its usefulness remains to be proven. Capillary blood lactate dosing, an emergent point-of-care technique readily available should be more sensitive to changes in these settings. prospective, observational, monocentric study conducted in a polyvalent internal medicine ward in a French University Hospital. The inclusion criteria were the existence of new symptoms of abrupt onset in an otherwise stable patient. All the patients had a point of care measurement of baseline capillary and venous lactate levels (EDGE, ApexBio) and standardized control before any therapeutic means were initiated. A follow-up test was performed once again within 12 to 36 hours. All the patients received standard medical care adapted to their condition. The primary outcomes were considered dying within 30 days or requiring intensive care or invasive therapeutic procedures. 13 patients were analyzed. Seven patients reached the composite outcome with 3 deaths. The superimposed complication proved to be infectious in every case. The median lactate levels were at baseline (mmol\/ l): capillary Mc0=5.2(2.16), venous Mv0=2.3(2.0) and arterial Ma0=1.8(1.7) and at follow-up (mmol\/ l) capillary: Mc1=3.3(1.1), venous Mv1=1.8(1.8) and arterial Ma1=1.3(0.7). In nonparametric analysis, the absence of normalization of capillary lactate at follow-up was correlated well with poor outcomes (p=.05). This was not the case of arterial or venous lactate measurements. The positive lactate clearance was present in the majority of patients (83.3%) but it did not predict the outcomes (p=.435) and there was no correlation between the baseline lactate and the clinical outcome (p&gt;.05). In non intensive care settings, capillary lactate level could be a more sensitive method than the classical lactate measurement for predicting the outcomes of acute conditions, especially infectious. A persistently high lactate level rather than its initial value or clearance seems to correlate better with poorer outcomes.

In the era of the sentinel lymph node, complete axillary lymphadenectomy, considered valuable until recently, but as therapeutic and diagnostic, has become an intervention performed increasingly rare in selected cases. Axillary lymphatic tissue resections are accompanied by morbidity (lymphedema, paresthesia, limitations of arm movement) and symptom magnitude is proportional to the extension of the intervention. For this reason, a solution to avoid these kinds of complications was looked for. Since Gould, in 1960, who mentioned cancer parotid and continuing with Cabanas, Morton, or Veronesi, many surgeons have contributed to the development of safe techniques with which the multidisciplinary team involved in the surgical treatment for breast cancer could perform a safe oncological intervention and at the same time could conserve the healthy tissue, thus limiting morbidity. To achieve this standard, axillary lymphadenectomy has passed through several stages, from over radical interventions that followed the Halsted era, in which, besides axillary lymph nodes, the internal mammary and jugulo-carotidian lymph nodes were excised, to the absence of axillary surgery and replacing it with radiation therapy.","526":null,"527":"The dissection of the cystic pedicle represents the \"main\" issue in performing the cholecystectomy, as well as the surgical moment when many accidents may happen.

The occurrence and development of the fibromatosis may be related to certain risk factors and genic mechanisms, although the exact causes are not yet fully known. The development of uterine fibroids is correlated not only with the metabolism and with the level of female sexual hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, but also with the number of these hormone receptors expressed on the surface of the myometrium. Proliferative effects of estrogen and progesterone may be exercised through proinflammatory factors (TNF alpha), growth factors (IGF1, IGF2, TGFbeta3 and betaFGF) or inhibitors of apoptosis (p53 suppression). A number of predisposing factors such as ethnicity - black skin, early menarche, nulliparity, caffeine and alcohol, chronic inflammation, obesity, were also identified. Approximately 40% of the uterine fibroids are caused by the same cytogenetic alterations found in the other tumor types such as kidney, lung, or leiomyosarcoma. As part of a system dysfunction, uterine fibromatosis was connected to other disorders such as AHT (arterial hypertension), endometrium adenocarcinoma, adenomyosis, endometriosis, diabetes mellitus, breast tumors, seemingly with a common causality.

The prevalence of sepsis is higher in male infants than in females, but the exact cause is unknown. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which leads to the production of NADPH. NADPH is required for the respiratory burst reaction in white blood cells (WBCs) to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis. Materials and methods.This study was performed on 76 neonates with sepsis and 1214 normal neonates from February 2012 to November 2014 in the west of Iran. The G6PD deficiency status was determined by fluorescent spot test. WBCs number and neutrophils percentages were measured and compared in patients with and without G6PD deficiency. Results.The prevalence of the G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.03). WBCs number and neutrophils percentages in G6PD deficient patients compared with patients without G6PD deficiency were decreased, but were not statistically significant (p=0.77 and p=0.86 respectively).

The survival of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) depends on multiple factors whose role is continuously updated, as the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease progression are understood. This study intended to assess whether the patient's gender and tumor location affect the disease outcome. Methods. Between 2008 and 2012, 155 patients with cutaneous MM underwent various types of surgeries in our clinic. Patients were staged according to the 2009 TNM classification. There were 90 women and 65 men. Primary tumors were located as it follows head and neck region - 4.5%, limbs - 50.7% and trunk - 44.8%. The disease free and overall survival rates (DFS, OS) were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results. Metastases developed in 52.3% of the males and 31.1% of the females (p=0.008). In univariate analysis, distant metastasis risk was significantly higher in men (p = 0.0472 for stage II patients and p = 0.0288 for stage III). In multivariate analysis, male gender almost doubled the risk of relapse (p = 0.044) and death (p = 0.022). Consequently, DFS and OS were significantly higher among females. Primary tumor location seemed to influence the melanoma spreading ability. Half of the trunk MM developed metastases while only a third of limbs MM did. The association between MM location and the recurrence risk was not random (p = 0.033). Conclusions. The patient gender represents an independent prognostic factor for both relapse and death. Although trunk MM had a significantly higher risk of metastasis than limbs MM, the location per se was not an independent prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.078).

Objectives. Evaluating the safety and efficiency of the surgical treatment by using the Unit Rod for scoliosis in adolescents and children presenting Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Summary. Surgical management of myopathic scoliosis still causes controversies regarding the timing of surgery (patient's age), the pelvic inclusion in the arthrodesis or the advantages of surgery over the conservatory treatment. The patients are very fragile and a long surgery with massive blood loss could lead to serious complications. Unit Rod instrumentation is simple, confers excellent stability and has a low rate of complications. Methods. This is a retrospective clinical and radiological study with a medium follow-up of 6.9 years including 13 patients diagnosed with Duchenne myopathy. All investigated patients were non-ambulatory at the time of surgery and have been treated by the Unit Rod technique at the University Hospital of Rouen between 2002 and 2008. Spinal fusion was, in all cases, realized from T2 to pelvis. Galveston technique of pelvic fixation and Luque's sublaminar wire instrumentation of the spine were used. Results. The results obtained with this treatment and post-surgery complications were analyzed and compared with those from literature. The advantages of this technique consist mostly in a good and stable pelvic fixation, a short interventional time, a minimal blood loss and few complications. Cobb angle correction is similar to that obtained by other surgical procedures. Conclusions. Using the Unit Rod instrumentation of scoliosis in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is safe, has excellent outcomes, brings post-surgery improvements, and has minor intra and post-surgery complications. The low cost of this treatment could make it a first choice for medical health systems with financial problems.","535":"Osteomas of the external ear are uncommon benign tumors that need to be differentiated from the external ear canal exostoses, bony proliferations that are linked mainly to cold-water exposure.

Methods. The study included 111 patients (divided into two groups, 61 without thrombosis and 50 with thrombosis) with bacterial respiratory infections and 30 healthy controls, age and gender-matched. The baseline evaluation of the patients included clinical, biological, and respiratory examination. LpPLA2 and MPO activities were measured by the spectrophotometric method. VEGF was quantified with an ELISA kit. Results. The collected data showed a correlation between the occurrence of superimposed thrombosis in respiratory infection patients, and the intensity of the inflammatory process, reflected by the increased MPO activity, and the dynamics of LpPLA2 and VEGF. Conclusion. Bacterial respiratory infections associate thrombotic vascular events of various degrees of severity, which correlate with the intensity of the inflammatory process, and the severity of endothelium dysfunction at the level of microcirculation. Starting from the recorded data, and based on the established severity scales in use, it is possible to compute a vascular risk score that takes into consideration the values of the three biomarkers under investigation.

Arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications are independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5D population. According to the guidelines, patients on renal replacement therapy represent a very high cardiovascular risk class. Case report. We report the case of a 67-year-old hypertensive male patient, known with CKD stage 5D on hemodialysis (three times per week), secondary bone mineral disease, admitted for progressive right leg pain. The physical examination detected right dorsalis pedis artery pulse absence. Blood biochemistry emphasized hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, metabolic acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, iPTH values above upper limits. The X-ray of right shin highlighted a vascular calcification with a \"train track\" aspect on the tibial-peroneal artery trunk and the thoracic X-ray (performed with low ray regime) showed calcium deposits in coronary arteries walls. Legs arteriography and coronary angiography were performed revealing multiple lesions on investigated vessels with an 80% narrowing of right coronary artery. The particularity of the case lies in the absence of angina in a chronic hemodialysis patient in whom multiple significant angiographically stenosis of the coronary arteries were found and successful endovascular therapy was performed. Conclusion. The broadening of the indication for coronary angiography should be considered in certain asymptomatic CKD stage 5D patients based on a risk score involving calcium, phosphate, PTH and acid-base imbalances, while considering their major influence on the structure and tone of vascular walls thus on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates.

According to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network, Romania reports an increasing number of resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from invasive infections every year. Material and Method. We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from blood in 2010 and 2015 in \"Matei Bals\" National Institute of Infectious Diseases, in order to identify any significant changes in the last five years. Results. We identified 18 strains in 2010 and 37 strains in 2015. Although the resistance to aminopenicillin-betalactamase inhibitors association, piperacillin-tazobactam, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, amikacin and the combined resistance decreased between these two time frames, this evolution was statistically non-significant. The same was noticed for the increased resistance rates to carbapenems. Conclusions. Antimicrobial resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae may become a major problem for the public health and the hospital-acquired infections control. Therefore, it needs further monitoring and efforts must be made in order to limit the increase of the resistance.","539":"Background: The aim of the study was to present the biological prognostic factors of mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. Methods: Several usual laboratory values were monitored: glucose, urea, partial pressure of oxygen, WBC count, hemoglobin, total bilirubin, and cholesterol. A statistical analysis was performed by using ROC curves and AUC interpretation. Results: The overall mortality rate was 21.1% and was different depending on the severity of the disease. Only 2.22% of the patients with a mild disease died, as opposed to 45.63% of the patients with a severe form. All the analyses studied were significantly elevated in the deceased patients. A close correlation between blood glucose, urea, partial pressure of oxygen, WBC, hemoglobin, total bilirubin, and cholesterol and mortality was objectified by measuring the AUC, which was of 97.1%, 95.5%, 93.4%, 92.7%, 87.4%, 82.2%, and 79.0%. Conclusions: The usual, easy to use, fast, and cheap tests were useful in predicting mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. Our study confirmed that the combination of several factors led to an accurate mortality prediction.","540":"Aim. The present study aimed to perform a medico-surgical comparative analysis of the 2 most widely used techniques: gastrostomy with peritoneal collar versus percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, based on the vast clinical experience in an Upper Digestive Surgery Clinic. Materials and method. A retrospective study was carried out between January 2010 and January 2015 on the patients admitted for a surgical solution for feeding. The indications, preoperative preparation, surgical techniques, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Results. Out of the 94 cases admitted for a surgical solution for feeding, 67 underwent gastrostomy with peritoneal collar (GPC) and in 27 cases percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed. The indications for GPC were benign or malign causes of dysphagia, the most frequent being malign tumors of tongue, pharynx and larynx (47.76%), advanced inoperable esophageal or eso-cardiac cancers (26,86%), post-caustic esophageal stenosis (10.44%). PEG was performed in patients with functional difficulties of swallowing: sequelae of cerebral vascular accidents (44.44%), low Glasgow Coma Scale Score (29.62%) of different etiologies, Parkinson disease (18.51%) advanced dementia (7.4%), early nasopharyngeal cancer (2 cases). The intraoperatory and postoperatory complications were few and of minor importance in both techniques, but PEG allowed an immediate retake of alimentation (vs. at least 48 hours wait in GPC), with less gastric stasis, biliary reflux and aspiration related respiratory problems. Conclusions. Both techniques are easy and safe to perform, but an appropriate selection is required according to the cause of the swallowing difficulty. In cases with permeable digestive tube, PEG may be an excellent minimally invasive solution, but the costs and availability of the PEG kit and prehydrolyzed nutritive solution, as well as the co-existence of an upper digestive endoscopy service were limitations that had to be taken into account.","541":"The article represents a retrospective clinical and radiological study. Objective. To assess the safety and the stability in time of the Unit Rod instrumentation in the treatment of severe neuromuscular scoliosis in children and adolescents. Summary. The treatment of patients with neuromuscular scoliosis always represents a challenge. The patients are debilitated and usual interventions are very long with great loss of blood. Serious complications can compromise the result of the surgery. The technique we used (the Unit Rod) is worldwide recognized, is simple, and gives excellent stability with a low rate of complications. Methods. We conducted a clinical and radiological retrospective study with a follow-up of at least 4 years in 58 patients with serious neuromuscular conditions, most of them being non-walkers. They were surgically treated by using mostly the Unit Rod technique, in the department of Paediatric Orthopaedics of the Rouen University Hospital, France, between 2000 and 2008. The back fusion was generally from T2 to pelvis. We used the Galveston technique for the patients who needed a pelvic fixation. Results. The mean Cobb angle correction was of 67% immediately after surgery; the correction of the curve decreased in time only in 4% of the cases. Pelvic obliquity was also very well corrected: 73% immediately and 70% at the last radiological follow-up. The mean operative time was of 175 minutes compared to 269 minutes for screws and hooks instrumentation. The most common complication for our technique was the radiolucent halo that appeared around the pelvic inserts. There was no significant degradation in time of the correction obtained. Conclusions. The use of this technique is safe, gives excellent results, achieving significant improvements in the postoperative functional status of the patients. The intra- and postoperative complications were minor. The advantage of using this method is the low cost of the material and technical simplicity, the corrective results being the same as the ones obtained with other techniques.","542":"Objective: To study the effects of intravitreal anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) therapy with Avastin for wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)-related symptoms. Methods: An exploratory trial was conducted from August 1, 2013 to February 1, 2014, that included 14 male patients previously diagnosed with BPH, who were aged between 59 and 69 years. The trial was performed in Bucharest and involved two medical institutions: the Clinical Hospital of Eye Emergencies and the \"Prof. Dr. Theodor Burghele\" Hospital. This prospective study utilized both objective and subjective indicators to analyze the link between intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for wet AMD and BPH. The evaluations consisted of uroflowmetry and International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) assessments. Results: The maximum flow rate (Qmax) improved by an average of 5.05 ml\/ sec in 9 patients, whereas the remaining 5 patients showed a slight decrease in Qmax (mean 1.6 ml\/ sec). The I-PSS score improved, with an overall decrease of 1.18 points at follow-up compared to the initial score (mean initial score = 2.42; mean follow-up score = 1.24). Conclusion: The analysis revealed that anti-VEGF therapy for wet AMD had a significant positive effect on all BPH-related symptoms; patients reported improved urinary streams and decreased nocturia. Abbreviations: BPH = benign prostatic hyperplasia, AMD = age-related macular degeneration, VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor, I-PSS = international prostate symptom score, Qmax = maximum flow rate, TSP-1 = thrombospondin-1, FGF-2 = fibroblast growth factor, mRNA = precursor messenger ribonucleic acid, PSA = prostate-specific antigen, DRE = digital rectal examination, AUR = acute urinary retention, COX2 = cyclooxygenase 2, QoL = quality of life.","543":"Obesity is considered a condition presenting a complex, multi-factorial etiology that implies genetic and non-genetic factors. The way the available information should be efficiently and strategically used in the obesity and overweight prohylaxisprogrammes for children all over the world is still unclear for most of the risk factors. Mothers' pre-conception weight and weight gain during pregnancy are two of the most important prenatal determinants of childhood obesity. Maternal obesity and gestational weight gain are associated with foetal macrosomia and childhood obesity, and this effect extends into adulthood. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in children originate in intrauterine life. The current obesity epidemic is probably the result of our evolutive inheritance associated with the consumption of highly processed food with an increased calorific value. The determination of risk factors involved in child obesity are: genetic predisposition, diet, sedentary behaviors, socioeconomic position, ethnic origin, microbiota, iatrogenic, endocrine diseases, congenital and acquired hypothalamic defects, usage of medications affecting appetite. However, the vast majority of patients will not have any of these identifiable conditions. Regardless of the aetiology, all the patients should be considered for modifiable lifestyle risk factors and screened for the complications of obesity.","544":"Healthcare industry continues to evolve under conditions of intense competition in approaching health prevention, protection, and promotion. Therefore, healthcare providers are challenged to always ensure better patient experience, winning patients' satisfaction, and loyalty and remain competitive on today's healthcare market. Healthcare markets bring together professionals and their patients into real collaborative relationships, which empower patients to contribute to the healthcare improvement. Within this competitive landscape, which is also characterized by digital health tools boosting patients' awareness and controlling their own health, medical providers need to be perceived as skilled and trustworthy in relying on patients' needs, expectations, and sacrifices are required in order to obtain the promised benefits. Moreover, while constantly providing a holistic assessment of the healthcare services' and experience attributes, acting on feedback and reaching healthcare service excellence, providing a better understanding of all the touch points with their patients and improving the quality and consistency of all these touch points, all these are achieved by employees, who are truly connected to the healthcare business. Today, patients are systematically becoming aware of the diversity of their choices, being increasingly involved in making better healthcare choices, and, so, more and more innovative products are introduced, targeting new patient segments. Findings from the last three years have shown that patients may achieve better outcomes due to the stakeholders' commitment to innovation within the context of the big-data revolution, by building new values.","545":"Introduction. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a Selected exercise program on the executive function of children with ADHD. Method. The participants were 40 male students, aged 7-11 years. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups (experimental and control). The experimental group participated in an exercise program for 24 sessions, 90 minutes per session. The control group did not receive any intervention. Before and after the exercise period, all the participants were assessed with Stroop and Go-No-Go tests, and the resulting data were analyzed by using MANCOVA. Result. The results showed that the cognitive inhibition of the children in the experimental group was significantly different compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the behavioral inhibition (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion. An organized physical activity helps to improve the executive function in children with ADHD.","546":"Background: Non-functional neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (NF-pNETs) are a varied group of extremely rare malignancies. The majority of patients already have liver metastases at the diagnosis moment, thus, treatment options are restricted, and the survival rate is reserved. Case report: We presented the case of 59-year-old patient, diagnosed with non-functional well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor grade II (NET G2) with the presence of chromogranin A, synaptophysin and somatostatin receptor 2, together with liver and bone metastases. Patient underwent a surgical excision of the pancreatic tumor, started long-acting somatostatin analogues (octreotide), interferon therapy for liver metastases and local radiotherapy for bone metastases. After one year, the patient developed diabetes, needing insulin therapy. At approximately three years after the diagnosis, the patient was still living, had a good quality of life, and was free of local recurrence of the tumor or other metastases. Conclusion: Our case report presented a rare case of metastatic non-functional well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, involving a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in order to obtain a good long-term survival.","547":"The Emergency Department (ED) has the highest workload in a hospital, offering care to patients in their most acute state of illness, as well as comforting their families and tending to stressful situations of the physical and psychological areal. Method. A cross-sectional survey of 366 Emergency Unit staff members including medical doctors, medical residents, medical nurses and ward aids, was undergone. Study participants came from four periphery hospitals in the Moselle Department of Eastern France with similar workforce and daily patient loads statistics. The instruments used were the Perceived Stress Scale PSS-10 and the Brief COPE questionnaire. Conclusions. Perceived work overload and overall stress is strongly related to work hours and tend to have a stronger influence on doctors than on the nursing staff. Substance use is a common coping method for medical interns, consistent with prior research. The regular assessment of the ED staff perception of stress and stress related factors is essential to support organizational decisions in order to promote a better work environment and better patient care.","548":"Aim. To analyze the efficiency of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the population aged 60 years and over admitted with acute cholecystitis, the clinical features and associated pathology presented by these patients and the impact of these factors on the choice of surgical technique. Materials and method. A retrospective study was carried out between February 2010 and February 2015, on patients aged 60 years and over, operated in emergency for acute cholecystitis in our clinic. All data were extracted from the registered medical documents and operatory protocols. Results. A total of 497 surgeries were performed for acute cholecystitis, of which 149 were patients aged 60 years and over (30%). Open surgery is much better represented in the population aged over 60 years (61.75% vs. 29.98%). One major cause is the associated pathology that increases the anesthetic risk and hampers a laparoscopic procedure. The conversion rate in the study group presented a higher percentage, but not more exaggerated than in the general population (6.71% vs. 4.63 %).Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery had a faster recovery and required lower doses and shorter term pain medication, in contrast to conventional surgery (1,8 days vs. 5.7 days). Bile leak has been of reduced quantity, short-term and stopped spontaneously. Only one case needed reintervention, in which aberrant bile ducts that were clipped were found in the gallbladder bed, was operated by laparoscopy. Wound infections and swelling were also encountered more frequently in patients that underwent classic surgery (3.24%). Conclusions. Performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, when possible, has produced very good results, reducing the average length of stay of patients and even decreasing the number of postoperative complications, thus allowing a faster reintegration of patients into society. The main concern was related to the associated pathology that increased the anesthetic risk.","549":null,"550":"Background: The field of parathyroidectomy (PTx) is complex and brings together many specialists. Even if the surgical approaches changed from classical to minimally invasive PTx, a good outcome is correlated with an adequate localization before and during PTx, while blood assays, such as parathormone (PTH) or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, become useful additional markers. Aim. Specific aspects related to parathyroidectomy and vitamins D (VD) were introduced. Material and Method. The article represents a PubMed-based narrative review. Results. The growing evidence regarding the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and early detection of primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) requires a particular attention to the association of these two disorders, which may be incidental, but some common pathogenic links are displayed. Low VD stimulates PTH production as a secondary or even tertiary type of HPT diagnosis. VD deficiency is associated with larger parathyroid adenomas and higher levels of PTH before and after surgery for primary HPT. Asymptomatically and normocalcemic forms of primary HPT, which are not immediately referred to PTx, require a normalization of the VD levels. VD supplements are safe under some serum calcium cutoffs and offer a better outcome after PTx. However, primary HPT is cured by surgery and, if the indication is well established, this should not be delayed too long to replace VD. Up to half of PTx cases may experience increased PTH levels after surgery, but most of these are transitory if rapid VD correction is done and only a few remaining cases will eventually develop persistent \/ recurrent primary HPT. Conclusion. A close following of 25-hydroxivitamin D represents one of the keys for a good outcome in the field of parathyroid surgery. Abbreviations: HPT = hyperparathyroidism, MEN = Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome, PTx = parathyroidectomy, PTH = parathormone, VD = Vitamin D.","551":"Preterm birth is the legal first global cause of neonatal death. The cervix has two roles: it has to stay closed to allow the fetus to undergo a normal development during gestation, and at term, the cervix has to dilate under the pressure of uterine contractions to allow the delivery. The purpose of this article is to establish if the ultrasound measured length of the cervix and its appearance are predictive for the spontaneous preterm birth. Cervical insufficiency can be described by painless cervical dilatation leading to pregnancy losses\/ births, with no other risk factors present. During gestation, the physiological softening of the cervix is determined by the extracellular matrix components, particular decorin, and thrombospondin 2. The direction of the collagen fibers remains the same - circumferential direction, but the collagen solubility increases. Therefore, during pregnancy, the cervical tissue is more hydrated and has higher collagen extractability than non-pregnant tissue. Women with cervical incompetence have increased levels of smooth muscle cells than normal pregnant women, the number of elastic fibers is low, and also the concentration of hydroxyproline is decreased. Transvaginal ultrasound is the suitable gold standard exam that can offer essential information about the cervical length and state of the internal os in early asymptomatic stage of cervical insufficiency for predicting and preventing preterm birth. In our experience, a transvaginal ultrasound screening for the measurement of the cervix is required. We consider that the proper gestational age for the prediction of a preterm birth is at 18-22 weeks of gestation for the general population and earlier for patients with a history of preterm birth. Just from an observational point of view, we concluded with the fact that the cerclage of the cervix is unnecessary if the cervical length is above 2 cm and if the internal cervical os is closed. In the absence of funneling, the probability of cervical incompetence is low and the best prophylactic option is progesterone administration.","552":"Aim. To present specific aspects of adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome (CS) by introducing well established aspects (\"do's\") and less known aspects (\"don'ts\"). Material and Method. This is a narrative review. Results. The \"do's\" for laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) are the following: it represents the \"gold standard\" for secretor and non-secretor adrenal tumors and the first line therapy for CS with an improvement of cardio-metabolic co-morbidities; the success rate depending on the adequate patients' selection and the surgeon's skills. The \"don'ts\" are large (&gt;6-8 centimeters), locally invasive, malignant tumors requiring open adrenalectomy (OA). Robotic adrenalectomy is a new alternative for LA, with similar safety and conversion rate and lower pain drugs use. The \"don'ts\" are the following: lack of randomized controlled studies including oncologic outcome, different availability at surgical centers. Related to the sub-types of CS, the \"do's\" are the following: adrenal adenomas which are cured by LA, while adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) requires adrenalectomy as first line therapy and adjuvant mitotane therapy; synchronous bilateral adrenalectomy (SBA) is useful for Cushing's disease (only cases refractory to pituitary targeted therapy), for ectopic Cushing's syndrome (cases with unknown or inoperable primary site), and for bilateral cortisol producing adenomas. The less established aspects are the following: criteria of skilled surgeon to approach ACC; the timing of surgery in subclinical CS; the need for adrenal vein catheterization (which is not available in many centers) to avoid unnecessary SBA. Conclusion. Adrenalectomy for CS is a dynamic domain; LA overstepped the former OA area. The future will improve the knowledge related to RA while the cutting edge is represented by a specific frame of intervention in SCS, children and pregnant women. Abbreviations: ACC = adrenocortical carcinoma, ACTH = Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, CD = Cushing's disease, CS = Cushing's syndrome, ECS = Ectopic Cushing's syndrome, LA = laparoscopic adrenalectomy, OA = open adrenalectomy, PA = partial adrenalectomy, RA = robotic adrenalectomy, SCS = subclinical Cushing' syndrome.","553":"Diabetes is a problem of great public health importance, creating a considerable burden to the affected individuals and society. The psychological approach of this disease implies the early acknowledging of behavioral symptoms and the construction of effective psychotherapeutic interventions. Regarding the psychological symptoms, cognitive malfunctions in diabetes include a slowing of information processing, attention, memory, and concentration, which, in turn, can significantly diminish motivation for therapy, compliance, and ability for self-care. Restrictions pertaining to daily activities, risks of treatment itself and the perceived inability to control the disease can furthermore reduce the perceived quality of life of these patients. Depression can complicate the picture, by a supplementary decrease in compliance and an increase of care expenses. A proper management of diabetes involves a joint action of the patient, physician, and the psychologist. A better self-care can include commuting from passive to active coping, getting informed, maintaining realistic hopes, and long-term thinking. Physicians can express more consistent empathy, thereby increasing confidence. A substantial gain can be brought by considering variables involved in modulating compliance (e.g. the patient's representations of gains and losses, group norms, ability vs. desire of control). Psychotherapeutic interventions include techniques such as counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation, hypnosis, and family therapy.","554":"","555":"We report the case of a 46-year-old patient, medical doctor with a relapsing unilateral CRSC-Central Serous Chorioretinopathy who was treated after an initial medical therapy (oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, oral antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - systemic and topical), with an oral aldosterone antagonist-Eplerenone (Inspra), resulted in significant anatomic and visual improvements.

Aim:The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of Vitamin D in the interplay between immune and inflammation effectors in AS associated-Acute Anterior Uveitis (AAU). Methods and Results:25-hydroxyvitamin D (Vit D), LL-37 peptide, IL-8 and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) were identified and quantified in the serum\/ plasma of thirty-four AS patients [eleven AS patients presenting AAU (AAU AS patients) and twenty-three AS patients without AAU (wAAU AS patients)] and eighteen healthy individuals (Control) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Acute-phase SAA level was significantly higher in AS patients compared to Controls. Contrary with wAAU AS patients, significantly elevated levels of IL-8, and diminished levels of Vit D characterized AAU AS patients. Regarding LL-37, its level decreased concomitantly with the level of Vit D. When AS patients were subgrouped based on AAU presence or on Vit D level, important associations between immuno-inflammatory assessed markers and AS features were noticed. Generally, Vit D levels were associated indirectly with leukocytes\/ neutrophils number or with ESR, CRP, and Fibrinogen levels. The levels of SAA and IL-8 associated directly with AAU or with AAU relapses, especially in AS patients with Vit D insufficiency, while SAA associated directly with infection\/ inflammatory markers and with disease activity indexes or with the degree of functional limitation. Discussion:Altered levels of Vit D affect the balance between LL-37, IL-8 and SAA, suggesting an association with AAU, an extra-articular manifestation of AS.

Unfortunately, the physiopathology is still under study. There are theories about carcinogenesis and it is known that not only a single factor is responsible for the development of a tumor, but several conditions. Stem cells are a promising target for the treatment of colorectal cancer, along with the environment that has an important role. It has been postulated that mutations within the adult colonic stem cells may induce neoplastic changes. This theory is based on the observation that within a colon cancer, less than 1% of the neoplastic cells have the ability to regenerate the tumor and therefore they are responsible for recurrence. It is important to know that a new way of treatment needs to be found, since these cells are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","559":"","560":":In its most severe form, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common congenital malformations.

To describe the characteristics of primary malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents in Romania. A retrospective analysis of all malignant bone tumors registered at a large referral center, \"Maria Sklodowska Curie\" Emergency Hospital for Children, between 2005 and 2013 was presented. A total of 146 biopsies and surgical resection specimens were reviewed during this period, and were classified as malignant bone tumors. There were 91 boys and 55 girls in the series, with a male-female ratio of 1.65:1. The average patient age was 13.32 years (2 to 19). The most common anatomical distribution of the tumors was femur - 32.19%, tibia - 25.34% and humerus - 11.64%. Histologically, we found osteosarcoma in 54.1% of all bone tumors, followed by Ewing's sarcoma - 30.82% and chondrosarcoma - 8.9%. Geographic location did not appear to represent a risk factor for any particular type of bone tumor. Our results were parallel to the findings previously reported in the general literature; the distribution and the epidemiology were similar to those in the other developed and underdeveloped countries. Malignant bone tumors in our country have a high mortality rate, because of the late diagnosis. ","564":"Respiratory obstruction and stridor in infants and children are not uncommon. A rare cause of these sometimes life-threatening symptoms is the congenital saccular cyst.

The patient data has been reviewed over the entire follow-up period and a thorough an analysis of her investigations and surgery was performed. The unusual evolution of this case was marked by an atypical exteriorization - not found in the published literature. The surgical approach was external, by paramedian thyrotomy, with no further long-term recurrence. An accurate diagnosis of saccular cysts can be made with the help of medical history, by an endoscopic visualization of the lesion and by the CT-scan imaging of the cervical region. Sometimes, saccular cysts can extend beyond laryngeal limits, determining fluid-filled tumors in the cervical region.

The understanding of the tumor molecular biology and the discovery of new drugs that target molecular pathways have increased the arsenal against advanced renal cell carcinoma and improved the outcomes in the patients suffering from these affections. Studying the molecular signaling that controls the tumor growth and the progression has led to the development of molecular therapies targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, resulting in a significant improvement in the overall survival and quality of life. Sunitinib represents an inhibitor of VEGFR 1-3, c-kit, FLT-3 and PDGFR. We present the case of a patient with metastatic clear cell RCC with a treatment effect following sequential VEGF and mTOR inhibitor treatment.

The most common form is diffuse adenomyosis, while focal adenomyosis, a cystic variant, is very rare, particularly in patients younger than 30 years old. Materials and methods. We reported a rare case of a 20-year-old Caucasian woman with cystic adenomyosis who was admitted in our service with severe chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia, who had received conservative surgical treatment to preserve fertility and improve her obstetrical prognosis. Results and Discussions. Although the necrobiosis of a uterine fibroid was suspected preoperatively, the extemporaneous histopathological exam revealed adenomyosis associated with fibroleiomyoma with hyaline dystrophy and multiple foci of endometriosis of cystic formation in the wall of a young woman without any risk factors. Conclusion. Although a rare lesion in young patients, cystic adenomyosis should be considered when chronic pelvic pain is exacerbated during menstruation and is associated with a uterine tumor. In young patients, the differential diagnosis should be made with uterine malformations (hematometra), necrobiosis of uterine fibroids, pelvic endometriosis. The surgical treatment should be conservative with the excision of the lesion, always taking into account fertility preservation in young patients.

The management of the ocular surface disease has changed dramatically over the years, with spectacular improvements of techniques, and of course, results. The amniotic membrane, used as a graft or as a substrate for the cultivation of limbal corneal cells has showed encouraging results. To investigate the usefulness of amniotic membrane transplantation in ocular surface pathologies. The study is retrospective. 28 eyes of 28 patients with ocular surface pathologies (ocular burns, recent and old, symblepharon, pterygium, corneal and conjunctival tumors, persistent epithelial defect) underwent an amniotic membrane transplantation during a 1 year period. The necrotic and the scar tissue were first excised in all the patients and the amniotic membrane was sutured with an epithelial face up. Follow up ranged from 1 to 12 months. Good results were obtained in all 28 eyes. The anatomy of cornea and conjunctiva was improved, with limited benefits only in old ocular burn, symblepharon and in one case of extended tumors of the cornea and conjunctiva. Out of 28 eyes, 23 (82%) also had a visual acuity improvement. The amniotic membrane may be considered a good alternative for ocular surface reconstruction especially in acute status.

Patients were assessed at baseline (T1), at one year (T2) and after two years at the end of the study (T3). Patients received a comprehensive rehabilitation program for the motor and sensory deficits throughout the study. Initially, a comprehensive evaluation (etiopathogenic, clinical and functional) that started from a thorough medical history of children (the older ones), was conducted but chose parents to identify the risk factors, and a complete physical exam. At each assessment, joint and muscle balance was conducted. To assess functionality, the gross motor function classification systems (GMFCS) and manual ability (MACS) were used. Many risk factors that were classified according to the timeline in prenatal factors, perinatal and postnatal, were identified from a thorough history. A direct correlation was noticed between the decrease of coarse functionality and manual ability, both initially and in dynamic and low APGAR scores, low gestational age, low birth weight and a higher body mass index of the mother. A direct link was observed between the gross motor function and the manual ability. A significant improvement in the MACS score was noticed in patients with a better GMFCS score.

New data suggest that fecal transplantation could also be efficient in other gastrointestinal diseases, for instance in inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, but, there are also some data that could imply the efficacy outside the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal transplantation should be considered a unique agent, capable of treating severe diseases, with essentially no adverse reactions, presenting a cure rate of over 90%. Materials and methods. This prospective study included 33 patients, of whom 28 patients with recurrent or resistant Clostridium difficile infection, who failed to be treated with conventional therapy, which presupposed vancomycin administration and 5 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, more precisely with ulcerative colitis, refractory on biologic agents (infliximab and adalimumab). In most of the cases, fecal transplant was realized with the infusion of stool through colonoscopy. Results. Most of the patients from both groups (Clostridium difficile infection and Ulcerative Colitis) responded (31 patients) with a total relief of the symptoms, after 1 FMT for Clostridium difficile group and after more than one for the ulcerative colitis group. The so-called primary cure rate was 96.42% for Clostridium group. For ulcerative colitis, group 3 of the patients needed 3 or 4 infusions for symptom relief. One patient was categorized as non-responsive (patient with UC) and needed surgery. Due to non-fecal transplant related causes, one death was reported. Conclusions. Fecal transplant is highly effective, safe, with practically no adverse effects, inexpensive, a procedure easy to be done that could be introduced in Clostridium difficile treatment protocols.

Medical files of 155 patients (132M\/ 23F) with urinary bladder cancer treated between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range: 19-85 years). Disease free survival (DFS) for patients with complete tumor resection receiving adjuvant treatment and progression free survival (PFS) for patients with post-operative residual disease was estimated. Stage disease's distribution was: 50 patients (32.2%) stage II, 47 (30.3%) stage III, 58 (37.4%) stage IV. Radical cystectomy was performed in 56 patients (36.1%), while 99 patients (63.9%) underwent repeated transurethral resection of the urinary bladder tumor (TURBT). The postoperative treatment included multimodal therapy in 47 patients (30.3%) (chemotherapy and external beam radiation), external beam radiation alone in 57 patients (36.8%) and chemotherapy alone (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin-MVAC or gemcitabine + platinum) in 51 patients (32.9%).

In spite of being successfully adopted in fields such as brokerage and banking, experts concluded that the SERVQUAL scale should be modified depending on the specific context. Moreover, the SERVQUAL scale focused on the consumer's perspective regarding service quality. While service quality was measured with the help of SERVQUAL scale, other experts identified a structure-process-outcome design, which, they thought, would be more suitable for health care services. This approach highlights a different perspective on investigating the service quality, namely, the physician's perspective.

Currently, according to the EULAR 2010 criteria, the rheumatoid factor (RF) and the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) are used for RA diagnosis. Since 2010, new biomarkers were discovered and proved useful in identifying RA in early stages. For a more rigorous management of these cases, one of the key steps in the evolution of patients with RA is to recognize and distinguish the more aggressive forms of the disease through prognostic biomarkers. \"Treat to target\" recommends the use of 3 composite scores to monitor the evolution of the disease: disease activity score (DAS 28), simple disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI), but, a new test was developed which better monitors the disease activity. The introduction of biological therapies has revolutionized the treatment of RA. Despite these advances, 20-40% of the patients are declared nonresponders to at least one of the therapies.

The velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, with a reported incidence of 1% in singleton pregnancies and 15% in monochorionic twin gestations, has been associated with obstetric complications: fetal growth restriction, prematurity, congenital anomalies, low Apgar scores, fetal bleeding with acute fetal distress and placental retention. The pathogenesis is unknown, but the trophotropism theory is the most common and supported by the association of velamentous cord insertion and placenta praevia. The prevalence of vasa praevia is of approximately 1\/ 2500 deliveries; the risk factors include the use of assisted reproductive technologies, low-lying placenta or placenta praevia, bilobed or succenturiate lobe placenta and multiple gestation.

The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with morbidity after conversion of Hartmann's operation. We retrospectively analyzed data of 56 patients who underwent reversal procedures between January 2004 and May 2015 in a single center. We evaluated the following variables: demographic characteristics, medical comorbidities, etiology for Hartmann operation, preoperative lab values, intraoperative surgical details and short-term outcomes (hospital stay, medical and surgical complications, mortality). There were 37 men (66.1%) and the mean age was 57 years. The most frequent indications for Hartmann's procedure were colorectal cancer in 25 patients (44.6%) and complicated diverticulitis in 10 patients (17.9%). The mean time to the reversal procedure was 9 months. Morbidity rate was 16.1% (9 patients) with an anastomotic leakage rate of 3.6% (2 patients) and mortality rate was 3.6% (2 patients). The most common medical complication was diarrhea (4 patients, 7.2%). Bivariate analysis demonstrated that the only factor significantly associated with postoperative complications was presence of multiple comorbidities. Multiple medical comorbidities is the only predictive factor for postoperative complications after Hartmann's reversal and therefore patient selection for this type of surgery is critical.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequently reported in this context and may play a role in the progression of the liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Renal disease is also an important extrahepatic manifestation of hepatitis viral infection and its presence is associated with poor prognosis and management issues. Our study had multiple purposes: to determine the frequency of the association between chronic viral liver disease and diabetes mellitus, evaluate the potential of diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for HCC and assess an eventual renal involvement. We included in our study a number of 246 patients with chronic liver disease, from whom 136 were diagnosed with chronic viral hepatitis and 110 with viral liver cirrhosis. These patients were assessed by using a clinical examination and a series of tests, including serum transaminase levels, serum bilirubin, serum albumin, markers of cholestasis, fasting plasma glucose levels, serum creatinine, urea, albuminuria, Addis-Hamburger test, electrophoresis of urinary proteins, abdominal ultrasound and, in some cases, CT examination. We obtained the following results: diabetes mellitus is often associated with chronic liver disease of viral etiology, having been identified in 18.29% of the patients in our study. Age above 60 in patients with chronic hepatitis (p=0.013&lt;0.05) and presence of hepatitis C virus were particularly correlated with the presence of diabetes mellitus. Renal disease was present in 13.4% of the patients with chronic liver disease and it was especially associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus. The most common form of renal injury was glomerulonephritis. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed only in cirrhotic patients as hepatorenal syndrome, occurring in 7.27% of the subjects, while chronic kidney disease was identified only in two cases of chronic viral hepatitis. Four patients in our study were diagnosed with HCC and none of them presented diabetes mellitus. Our study revealed that there is a significant association between diabetes mellitus and chronic viral liver disease induced by hepatitis C virus. Glomerulonephritis was the most common type of renal disease in both hepatitis patients and in those with cirrhosis. Glomerular injury was strongly correlated with the presence of hepatitis C virus than with hepatitis B virus.

All the patients included had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed, excluding patients who had a history of gastritis, endoscopically demonstrated ulcer or those with a history of gastrointestinal dyspeptic phenomena. The endoscopic examination found acute erosive gastritis in eight cases, gastric ulcer (four cases) and duodenal ulcer (six cases). No serious complications were encountered. Four patients had no clinical manifestations with endoscopic expression. Lesions were mainly mild esophagitis (Grade I) and only in three cases, esophagitis grade II or III was found. Twelve patients (40%) had Helicobacter pylori infection and had endoscopic changes (gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or gastric lesions). The adverse effects of NSAIDs in patients with osteoarthritis vary in severity. Patient age significantly influences the severity of injuries. We have not found significant differences in the incidence of COX2 selective and non-selective NSAID-induced lesions.

Since 2013, an increased trend of endometrial cancer occurrence has been registered in urban areas as compared with rural ones. Unfortunately, most of the cancer cases are diagnosed too late, in an advanced stage of the disease, resulting into diminished lifetime expectancy. The first part of the article concentrated on issues such as: the description of the study, results, and discussions regarding the study, definitions and terms, risk factors specific for endometrial carcinomas, presentation of the activities of the Program, etc. Drafting a national program that will serve as an early diagnosis method of endometrial cancer.

A substantial advance in digestive endoscopy that has been made during the last decade is represented by digital chromoendoscopy, which was developed as a quicker and sometimes better alternative to the gold standard of dye spraying. Fujifilm developed a virtual coloration technique called Flexible spectral Imaging Color Enhancement (FICE). FICE provides a better detection of lesions of \"minimal\" esophagitis, of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and of squamous cell esophageal cancer. The use of FICE resulted in an improvement in the visualization of the early gastric cancer, being less invasive, and time consuming than the classic dye methods. Current evidence does not support FICE for screening purposes in colon cancer but it definitely improves characterization of colonic lesions. Its use in inflammatory bowel disease is still controversial and in video capsule endoscopy is considered a substantial progress. Conclusions. The use of FICE endoscopy in routine clinical practice can increase the diagnostic yield and can provide a better characterization of lesions.

The initial diagnosis of DE is of high importance, but also challenging. This is because the biochemical changes in the tear film often develop before any detectable signs. In this study, the possible relationship between ocular symptomatology, tear volume and tear break-up time (TBUT) and lipocalin, lactoferrin and lysozyme concentrations in the tear film were explored in a group of symptomatic dry-eyed postmenopausal (PM) women compared to age-matched controls. Sixty-six healthy PM females with ages of at least 50 years were grouped in two homogeneous lots (by age, post-menopause, co-morbidities) of 33 females each, one lot presenting mild or moderate dry eye syndrome (DE) and one asymptomatic non-dry eye (NDE), based on their feedback to the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and noninvasive TBUT and Schirmer test results. Tears were collected via capillary tubes and an eye wash method. Tear lysozyme, lactoferrin and lipocalin concentrations were determined via electrophoresis. OSDI responses revealed 3 mild DE, 30 moderate DE and 33 NDE. The OSDI total score and sub scores for the DE group were significantly greater than for the NDE group (p &lt; 0.001). The mild and moderate DE group exhibited significantly shorter TBUTs compared to NDE (p &lt; 0.001). No difference in tear lysozyme or lipocalin concentrations was found between DE and NDE groups, irrespective of the tear collection method, but a significant difference was found in lactoferrin concentration (p&lt;0.001). No significant correlations were found between symptoms or signs of DE compared to either lipocalin, lysozyme or lactoferrin concentrations. In a PM population, lipocalin and lysozyme are invariable, irrespective of the presence and severity of DE symptoms. However, lactoferrin shows a significant decrease. This is a comprehensive study of lipocalin, lactoferrin and lysozyme in dry-eyed PM women and our results suggested that lactoferrin could be used as a biomarker of DE in postmenopausal women.

","618":"Preeclampsia is a unique pregnancy-related disease that affects 5-7% pregnancies worldwide. Placental architecture is modified in PE and eclampsia. Placental morphology and cellular arrangement are important for oxygen delivery from the mother to the fetus. Fetal growth and well-being after 20 weeks of gestation are dependent upon successful placental development. This, in turn, is achieved by an enhanced maternal blood supply to the placenta (normal uterine artery Doppler) and growth\/ differentiation of the gas-exchanging placental villi. Conversely, pregnancy with severe placental insufficiency exhibits abnormalities both in uterine artery and in umbilical artery Doppler, and results in adverse perinatal outcome. The evaluation of placental functioning is possible nowadays through ultrasound examinations. Sonographic images associated with placental lesions include cystic areas, heterogeneous appearance of the placental mass, and thick or thin placentas. Sonographic evidence of destructive placental lesions is defined as the evolution of irregular cystic spaces with echogenic borders - the echogenic cystic lesions. Histological examinations of placenta may confirm these antepartum observations. Decidual vasculopathy and accelerated villous maturity are considered indicative of uteroplacental vascular insufficiency. Perivillous fibrin deposition and intervillous fibrin are considered indicative of intervillous coagulation. Detailed sonographic evaluation of the placenta and histopathological confirmation after birth are used to identify lesions associated with preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and adverse short and long-term perinatal outcome, but the presence of cystic images in the placenta is not uniformly associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Combining Doppler studies with placental texture studies may lead to satisfactory results.","619":"A neurologic deficit of sudden onset conforming to a vascular territory is a clear clinical indication that a patient suffers from an acute stroke.

Out of the total number of patients (N=34) diagnosed with active acromegaly, only some were followed (N=25; male\/ female ratio: 6\/ 19; mean age: 51.8 years) by testing GH, IGF1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1), basal glucose and oral glucose tolerance test (OCGTT) at baseline, 6 and 12 months under Octreotide (first 6 months with 20 mg\/ 28 days + 6 months with 30 mg\/ 28 days). Pre-treatment values were 17.6% of patients had DM, 14.7% - impaired glucose tolerance, 26.5% - impaired fasting glucose, and 41.2% - normal assays. From the statistical point of view, the DM patients were significantly older and had higher GH levels than the acromegalic without glycaemia disturbances. They did not achieve significant changes in basal blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin after 6 months, neither after 12 months. After 6 months, there were no significant changes in basal glycaemia in patients with normal baseline glycaemia but 2-hours OGTT glucose values were significantly lower than initially (82.35 mg\/ dl vs. 93 mg\/ dl, p=0.005) consistent with reduced levels of GH and IGF1. After 12 months, both basal and 2-hours glucose levels in OGTT were similar to baseline despite the significant lower GH (3.3 vs. 6.61 ng\/ mL, p=0.003) and IGF1 (332 vs. 713 ng\/ mL, p=0.001). Octreotide therapy induces an improvement in glycemic profile in patients with active acromegaly without diabetes mellitus consistent with decreased levels of GH and IGF1. In patients with diabetes, partial control of glucose metabolism is due to inadequate suppression of GH and IGF1 after one year of treatment.

Considering the neurological soft signs as neurobiological markers in schizophrenia, the aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis of the existence of this \"schizo-obsessive\" endophenotype of schizophrenia, by using the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) in patients with schizophrenia. The study was conducted in a transversal manner and consisted of the assessment of 64 patients with the maximum age of 26 years, who fulfilled the DSM IV-TR criteria of schizophrenia and\/ or OCD, the assessment performed both from the social-demographic view, as well as neurologic, by means of the NES scale. Patients with schizophrenia and OCD proved to have, a significant family history from a static point of view, more loaded by affective disorders, but also by schizophrenia and OCD spectrum disorders, compared to pure schizophrenics. They also proved to have a significant higher educational level and a better occupational functioning than those schizophrenic patients without OCD, despite the similarity of the number of hospitalizations episodes or the disease duration to date. Ratings on the NES scale differentiate the group of patients with schizophrenia and OCD as having the highest scores on all subscales, scores much closer to those obtained by the group of patients with schizophrenia only, the only difference with statistical significance being recorded on the sequencing subscale of complex motor acts. The analysis of cluster through linear discriminant analysis allowed the classification of patients in the 3 groups with a probability of 89.06% and 76.56% for cross-validation. The results regarding neurological soft signs suggest that the presence of OCD in schizophrenic patients is due to peculiarities in fronto-basal ganglia circuits with possible origins in neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We considered that the early detection of neurological soft signs and their dynamic monitoring could provide useful information on the evolution of schizophrenia. Future research should take into account larger groups of patients to investigate the relationship between neurological soft signs and brain neuroimaging data, as well as the results provided by neuropsychological investigations customed in this subgroup of schizophrenia.

A way to reduce the impact of iron on oxidative stress in haemodialysis patients may be the administration of iron through arterial extracorporeal circuit. Objective The aim of our study was to compare the influence of iron route of administration (venous versus arterial extracorporeal circuit infusion) on antioxidant parameters in red blood cells of haemodialysis patients in order to clarify if arterial iron administration can have positive impacts related to iron induced oxidative stress. Method Twenty stable patients on regular haemodialysis treatment were selected for the study. They were investigated in a cross-over design at 3 mid-week HD sessions, one week apart, without iron [HD basal] and with either IV infusion of 100mg iron sucrose over the first 20 minutes of HD session, via venous line [HDvenous], or the same solution infused on the arterial extracorporeal circulation [HDarterial].

Erythrocytes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, non-protein thiol levels and total antioxidant capacity (TEAC) were analysed. Conclusion Haemodialysis significantly decreases the total antioxidant activity in erythrocytes.

Small (mm-3 cm) and medium (3 cm-10 cm) hemangiomas are well-defined lesions, requiring no active treatment beside regular follow-ups. However, the so-called giant liver hemangiomas, of up to 10 cm (most commonly) and even 20+ cm in size (according to occasional reports) can, and usually will develop symptoms and complications that require prompt surgical intervention or other kind of therapy. HH belong to the class of hepatic \"incidentalomas\", so-called because they are diagnosed incidentally, on imaging studies performed as routine examinations or for other reasons than the evaluation of a possible liver mass. Less than half of HH present with overt clinical symptoms, consisting, most often, of upper abdominal pain (this is usually the case for large lesions, which cause the distension of Glisson's capsule). Hepatic hemangiomas require a careful diagnosis to differentiate from other focal hepatic lesions, co-occurring diagnoses are also possible.

The aim of our study was to predict the presence of neoplastic colorectal lesions by specific biomarkers in \"medium risk\" individuals (age 50 to 75, with no personal or family of any colorectal neoplasia). We designed a prospective cohort observational study including patients undergoing diagnostic or opportunistic screening colonoscopy. Specific biomarkers were analyzed for each patient in peripheral lymphocytes - presence of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) and the Nuclear Division Index (NDI) by the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN). Of 98 patients included, 57 were \"medium risk\" individuals. MN frequency and NPB presence were not significantly different in patients with neoplastic lesions compared to controls. In \"medium risk\" individuals, mean NDI was significantly lower for patients with any neoplastic lesions (adenomas and adenocarcinomas, AUROC 0.668, p 00.5), for patients with advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma and adenocarcinoma, AUROC 0.636 p 0.029) as well as for patients with adenocarcinoma (AUROC 0.650, p 0.048), for each comparison with the rest of the population. For a cut-off of 1.8, in \"medium risk\" individuals, an NDI inferior to that value may predict any neoplastic lesion with a sensitivity of 97.7%, an advanced neoplastic lesion with a sensitivity of 97% and adenocarcinoma with a sensitivity of 94.4%.

It is characterized by a longitudinal and rotational imbalance. 54 patients were analyzed and 39 out of them were operated by various approaches with anterior and posterior instrumentations during 2000 and 2012. The impossibility to appoint some patients encountered in the daily practice into the known classifications, allowed us to purpose two categories of congenital scoliosis related to the predominance of spinal deviances in the coronal and transversal views. No certain etiology of congenital scoliosis has been identified until today. The susceptibility of some polygenic defects is obvious due to the presence of a sum of defects associated to most of the congenital scoliosis cases and the rarity of the presence of a unique defect. The diagnosis requires a thorough clinical and imaging examination in order to establish an individualized therapeutic strategy. The treatment of congenital scoliosis is different from the adolescent idiopathic one. Therapeutic criteria are significantly different.

TMS mapping can also quantify the excitability of the motor area in both the ipsilesional (IL) and contralateral (CL) hemisphere. This study is the first to measure the dynamics of cortical excitability by TMS mapping before and after treatment with low-frequency (LF) rTMS in the contralesional hemisphere at three different timepoints. Furthermore, the patients were clinically evaluated during the same visit as the mapping to establish both short and long-term outcomes after rTMS treatment. A total of 16 participants with acute ischemic stroke were assessed 10 days post-stroke by TMS mapping. The patients were randomized into two equal groups: a real rTMS group and a sham group. The rTMS group received LF-rTMS to the contralesional hemisphere for 10 days, starting on the first day after the first mapping. Each subject was also evaluated by mapping on days 45 and 90 after stroke onset. The primary clinical outcome measured was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) on days 10, 45 and 90 post-stroke. At 10 days after stroke onset, both groups presented low excitability in the lesion side and high excitability in the non-affected side. In the real rTMS group, at 45 days after stroke, a downward trend in the excitability of the contralesional hemisphere and an upward trend in the excitability of the lesioned side were observed. At 90 days after stroke, a tendency toward balanced excitability between both hemispheres was observed. In the sham group, at both 45 and 90 days, we observed increased excitability in the non-affected side compared to the side with the lesioned motor area. At 45 days, the real rTMS group demonstrated a better recovery of the upper limb motor function than the sham group, but at 90 days, there was no significant difference between the two groups. These results demonstrated that LF-rTMS treatment enhances rebalance of the excitability patterns in both hemispheres and led us to question the \"one size fits all\" approach widely used in rTMS interventions.

Infrared thermography can be used for the assessment of the affected area also by using a thermography camera that is sensitive to the infrared spectrum. An intense and diffuse infrared emission is highly suggestive for the inflammation and implies that a more aggressive treatment should be initiated. After the clinical resolution of the affected area, the symmetry of the thermal pattern should be restored. If the asymmetry persists, a neuropathic complication of the virus reactivation could be involved.

Increased sympathetic activity is contributory, inducing a reversible cardiac myocyte damage and cardiac enzyme surges. Some of the most frequent electrocardiographic abnormalities in stroke are ST segment abnormalities and various tachyarrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation) and bradyarrhythmias. One can infer the importance of careful and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of the stroke patient in order to identify these quite frequent electrocardiographic alterations, as it is well known that death due to cardiac arrhythmias is common among acute stroke patients. In order to increase the diagnostic yield, a high level of NTproBNP (N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide) may be used as a discriminant for the patients with a higher probability of cardiac arrhythmias and mortality at presentation, during hospitalization and on the long term. In such patients, cardiac monitoring techniques are more likely to reveal abnormalities.

The potential correlation between the symptomatology, tear break-up time (TBUT) and lipocalin, lactoferrin and lysozyme concentrations in the tear film were investigated in a group of symptomatic dry-eyed postmenopausal (PM) women compared to age-matched controls, considering the patients with eyelid tumors. 66 females were divided into two groups of 33 females each, one group having dry eye (DE) and one asymptomatic group (non-dry eye) (NDE), based on their responses to the OSDI questionnaire, TBUT and Schirmer test evaluation. Tears were collected via capillary tubes. Tear lysozyme, lactoferrin and lipocalin concentrations were determined via electrophoresis and the results for patients with or without eyelid tumors were compared. The results revealed significant differences in lysozyme concentration between patients with or without eyelid tumors in the DE group (p = 0.004). Lower levels for TBUT and lactoferrin in the DE group were also found, compared to the NDE group for eyelid tumors patients. Tear lipocalins were in the same range in both groups. Within a PM population, some components of the tear film were found to be at lower levels in patients with eyelid tumors, compared to patients without this pathology, which resulted in the development of DE or in the enhancement of the symptoms of an existing DE. ","673":"This study compares the outcomes and complications of hydroxyapatite ocular implant and non-integrated ocular implants following evisceration. This is a retrospective study of 90 patients who underwent evisceration for different ocular affections, in the Ophthalmology Department of the University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, between January 2009 and December 2013. The outcomes measured were conjunctival dehiscence, socket infection, implant exposure and extrusion rate. Forty-three patients had the hydroxyapatite implant (coralline-Integrated Ocular Implants, USA or synthetic-FCI, France) and forty-seven received non-integrated ocular implants (24 acrylic and 23 silicone). Five cases of socket infection, thirteen cases of extrusion and two cases of conjunctival dehiscence were encountered. There was a higher rate of conjunctival dehiscence with hydroxyapatite ocular implant, but implant extrusion and socket infection were found in non-integrated ocular implants. ","674":"EWS\/FLI-1 fusion mainly appears in Ewing's sarcoma or the primitive neuroectodermal tumors and represents a genomic marker for these tumors. However, it can appear with lower frequency in other soft tissue tumors. The paper investigates the presence of EWS\/FLI-1 fusion in clinically diagnosed sarcoma belonging to different non-Ewing connective tissue tumors in order to search for a possible new biomarker valuable for investigators. 20 patients with soft tissue tumors, who underwent surgery, were tested. Intra-operative samples of normal and tumor tissue were collected for histopathological diagnosis and genetics determinations. The patients' RNA from tumor and normal peritumoral tissue was extracted and EWS\/FLI-1 fusion screened by quantitative real-time PCR. The relative expression of the fusion in the tumor sample was compared to the similar expression in normal tissue. The amplification in the threshold zone was shown by 5 samples (25%): 2 clear cell sarcoma, 1 fibrosarcoma, 1 malignant tumor of nerve sheath, 1 metastatic adenocarcinoma. We differentiated between the unspecific amplification and concluded that these are weak positive results. Genomic investigation may establish the tumor malignancy and its possible affiliation earlier than histopathology. It can support the screening of EWS\/FLI-1 fusion in a larger variety of clinically diagnosed soft tissue tumors. ","675":"The following study aims to evaluate the monotherapy with biologic agents: Infliximab (IFX), Etanercept (ETA), Adalimumab (ADA) and Rituximab (RTX) in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To achieve these objectives, the database of \"Dr. I. Cantacuzino\" Clinical Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology, was used. The study was retrospective and descriptive, covering 168 patients with RA, followed for 12 months, from January 2012 to January 2013. Admission criteria for the study were the following: patients diagnosed with RA according to ACR 1987\/ EULAR 2010 criteria, disease activity score (DAS 28)&gt; 5.1, positive inflammation tests, presence of RA refractory to classic remitting treatment administered at least 6 months prior to the initiation of biological therapy, on patients treated with RTX. They were considered non-responders after 6 months of treatment with anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) and decided to switch agents with anti CD-20. Comparing values between any two points in time (baseline - 6 months -12 months) for any type of therapy, there were significant decreases in the values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), reactive C protein (CRP) and disease activity score (DAS 28). There were no significant differences between therapies regarding ESR at 6 months (p = 0.070, ANOVA) and 12 months (p = 0.375, Kruskal-Wallis), significant differences were regarding CRP at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.000, Kruskal-Wallis) and DAS 28 at 6 months (p = 0.000, Kruskal- Wallis) and 12 months (p = 0.018, Kruskal-Wallis).

","676":"The upper digestive hemorrhage is one of the main causes of mortality from liver cirrhosis (CH). The measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) by angiographic way can be used for the determination of the risk of hemorrhage. The aim of this study is to verify the influence of the HVPG measurement upon the survival in patients with CH and upper digestive hemorrhage. A retrospective pilot study on 33 patients with upper digestive hemorrhage divided into two groups according to the therapeutic attitude followed, was carried out. One group was classically treated, with variceal band ligation, non-elective beta-blockers and in emergency Octreotide. The other group was treated depending on the value of HVPG. From the moment of the first episode of digestive hemorrhage, the survival period was in average of 8.1 months for the patients with viral etiology and for those with alcoholic etiology it was of 19.7 months. In patients treated after HVPG measurement, the average survival period was of 34.2 months and in patients \"classically\" treated, the average survival period was of 15.5 months (significant difference). In conclusion, the measurement of HVPG allowed the selection of a high-risk group of patients. This permitted the making of a therapeutical decision with a significant prolongation of life in these patients.

The anterior lateral thigh flap sensitive myocutaneous (ALTF) with vastus lateralis muscle was used to reconstruct the oral defect in a patient undergoing total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation for T4 tongue cancer. Good functional outcomes, measured by independent feeding, speech and swallowing, were achieved. The anterolateral thigh myocutaneous flap for total tongue reconstruction creates a free neotongue tip with an adequate volume, producing acceptable swallowing function and cosmesis. The reconstruction with free flaps is a feasible method of restoring the functional outcomes in speech and deglutition among patients who undergo total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation.

Little information is known about Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) keratoconjunctivitis in association with AIDS. Because HSV-1 is becoming, day by day, a common eye disease (nearly 100% patients of over 60 years old harbor HSV in their trigeminal ganglia at autopsy), this article discussing a worldwide public health problem. The purpose of this paper is to compare the incidence and clinical aspects of HSV-1 Keratitis in HIV\/ AIDS patients compared with the general population who develops HSV- 1 Keratitis. The study is retrospective and comparative. Each patient was examined thoroughly at the biomicroscope ocular slit after corneal staining with fluorescein or rose bengal. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure and corneal sensitivity were also examined. From 170 patients with HIV and ocular anterior segment disorders, 47 patients had viral etiology. 58 patients had keratitis; 14 of them were HSV-1 keratitis. Doctors should be aware of the existence of the ocular damage in HIV\/ AIDS and emphasize the importance of regular ophthalmologic examination of patients with HIV\/ AIDS as HSV infection is common nowadays among the general population. ","680":"Multiple myeloma and JAK2 positive chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are hematologic malignancies with a completely different cellular origin. Two cases of simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma, one with primary myelofibrosis and another one with essential thrombocythemia are reported in this article. In such cases, an accurate diagnosis requires a molecular testing, including gene sequencing and differential diagnosis of pancytosis associated with splenic amyloidosis. In general, in such cases, of two coexisting malignant hematologic diseases, the treatment of the most aggressive one is recommended. For our two cases, it was decided to start a Velcade based therapy. The main concern was the medullar toxicity, especially when a multiple myeloma was associated with a primary myelofibrosis.","681":"Abdominal pregnancy, a rare diagnosis, belongs to the ectopic pregnancy group, the leading cause of pregnancy related exitus. The positive diagnosis is very difficult to establish most often in an acute setting, leading to a staggering percent of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality. We present the case of 26-weeks-old abdominal pregnancy with partial feto-placental detachment in a patient, after hysteroscopy and in vitro fertilization, which until the acute symptoms that led to emergency laparotomy went unrecognized. The patient recovered completely and satisfactorily after surgery and, due to the high risk of uterine rupture with regard to a second pregnancy, opted for a surrogate mother. Abdominal pregnancy can be regarded as a difficult to establish diagnosis, with a greater chance in case of increased awareness. It is compulsory to be well informed in order not to be surprised by the diagnosis and to apply the correct treatment immediately as the morbidity and mortality rate is elevated. ","682":"Infantile Hemangiomas (IH) are the most frequent tumors of vascular origin, and the differential diagnosis from vascular malformations is difficult to establish. Specific types of IH due to the location, dimensions and fast evolution, can determine important functional and esthetic sequels. To avoid these unfortunate consequences it is necessary to establish the exact appropriate moment to begin the treatment and decide which the most adequate therapeutic procedure is. Based on clinical data collected by a serial clinical observations correlated with imaging data, and processed by a computer-aided diagnosis system (CAD), the study intended to develop a treatment algorithm to accurately predict the best final results, from the esthetical and functional point of view, for a certain type of lesion. The preliminary database was composed of 75 patients divided into 4 groups according to the treatment management they received: medical therapy, sclerotherapy, surgical excision and no treatment. The serial clinical observation was performed each month and all the data was processed by using CAD. The project goal was to create a software that incorporated advanced methods to accurately measure the specific IH lesions, integrated medical information, statistical methods and computational methods to correlate this information with that obtained from the processing of images. Based on these correlations, a prediction mechanism of the evolution of hemangioma, which helped determine the best method of therapeutic intervention to minimize further complications, was established. ","683":"The unique and complex anatomy of the orbit requires significant contouring of the implants to restore the proper anatomy. Fractures of the orbital region have an incidence of 10-25% from the total facial fractures and the most common age group was the third decade of life. The majority of cases required reconstruction of the orbital floor to support the globe position and restore the shape of the orbit. The reason for this was that the bony walls were comminuted and\/ or bone fragments were missing. Therefore, the reconstruction of the missing bone was important rather than reducing the bone fragments. This could be accomplished by using various materials. There is hardly any anatomic region in the human body that is so controversial in terms of appropriate material used for fracture repair: non resorbable versus resorbable, autogenous\/ allogeneic\/ xenogenous versus alloplastic material, non-prebent versus preformed (anatomical) plates, standard versus custom-made plates, nonporous versus porous material, non-coated versus coated plates. Thus, the importance of the material used for reconstruction becomes more challenging for the ophthalmologist and the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. ","684":"Over the past years, there has been an increasing interest in involving the cancer patients in the decision making regarding the therapy management due to several factors. The most important aspect to be taken into consideration is the principle of patient autonomy. More and more patients have become interested in making informed decisions regarding their therapy options and physicians need to be able to provide data on the aspect. Some patient-physician models have been proposed and used for 40 years now. Still, the debate is very important for most of the physicians due to the shifts in the approach. To really express the concerns that the authors address, the case of a head and neck cancer patient and the possible dialogues with the physician were presented. Each type of communication model with the patient is very important because nowadays, intrications between the four are likely to occur. There are legal aspects that need to be taken into consideration such as the informed consent, the ethical and moral aspects. The possibility of individualized oncological therapy for the cancer patient leads to different decisions for both the patient and the physician. The decision making process involves the patient at different levels. Legal implications tend to affect the healthiness of the dialogue between the physician and the cancer patient and might be a key-point in the further development of the ethical aspects.

The objectives of our study were to describe the epidemiological evolution of varicella in Romania between 2004 and 2013 and the clinical characteristics of the cases admitted to NIID between 2011 and 2013. An epidemiological retrospective study was conducted by using the information reported quarterly by general practitioners and hospitals at the national level. There is no system for the surveillance of severe cases in Romania, so, to describe the clinical characteristics of varicella cases, a second retrospective study was developed, in which the patients hospitalized in the NIID, within the period 2011-2013, were included. Questionnaires were completed by using data from the clinical observation forms. Collected information included demographic, clinical and laboratory data, complications, date of onset and admission, length of stay, admission and discharge diagnosis. Data were processed and analyzed by using Microsoft Excel program. A total of 504,844 cases were reported of at the national level between 2004 and 2013, with a mean incidence of 238.2\/ 100,000 inhabitants. The most affected age group was 5-9 years old (incidence 1362.7\/ 100,000 inhabitants). The study conducted in NIID, registered 353 patients hospitalized with varicella between 2011 and 2013. Most of the hospitalized cases (88.8%) were under 10 years old and many (72.6 %) attended a community. The majority of cases had rash (98.6%) and fever (79.9%). The main complications were pneumonia (46.2%), bacterial infection (16.1%) and encephalitis (2.5%). Varicella is a very common disease in Romania, which may develop complications. A specific surveillance system should be introduced in order to provide accurate epidemiological, clinical and laboratory information to assess whether varicella is a public health problem in Romania and if the introduction of vaccination in NIP is recommended. However, given the large number of current cases in Romania, a solution may be a sentinel surveillance system type.

","694":"The existent classifications of congenital scoliosis cannot contain all the cases encountered in the medical practice taking into account the complexity of the spine deformity in this pathology. The paper represents a retrospective study that analyses a new classification of congenital scoliosis in comparison with the existing classification. This study analyses 56 cases over a period of 14 years (2000-2013), based on the spine dominant deviation: longitudinal or rotational imbalance. This new classification contains not only the formation, segmentation and mixed defects, but also the formation failure with or without fusion failure of the ossification centers (wedged vertebra, hemivertebral body, segmented, hemisegmented, unsegmented hemivertebra, which may be successive, intermittent, alternant compensated or alternant decompensated). It also contains the congenital scoliosis with a rotational imbalance by spinal traction, spinal pushing or by a mixed effect. In comparison with the other classifications in literature: Winter, Imagama or Kawakami, this classification systematizes data according not only to the spatial disposition of the hemivertebrae, but also to the balance of the deformity. In conclusion, this classification of congenital scoliosis has a practical, diagnostic, therapeutical and prognostic use.

Clinicians aided by scientists are engaged in research approaches that include heredity aspects linked with behavior, education, applied nutrition studies and clinical therapies in order to prevent, control and reverse obesity. The common goal is to identify areas of basic and clinical research to understand aspects of human biology that may be considered as obesogenic. Regarding these approaches, recent discoveries in genetics, epigenetics and functional genomics, based on advancing technologies, are tools employed to prevent and treat obesity. The purpose of this article is to present the current knowledge of key components of the FTO gene role in the obesogenic system that links genetic, epigenetic and environmental, lifestyle\/ diet nutritional and behavioral components and to describe the results obtained by genotyping and interviewing relevant selected groups of Romanian population. FTO rs9939609 genotyping was performed on a Romanian study group of 53 subjects (30 obese, 23 normal). Results have been analyzed in association with obesity parameters and comorbidities in order to identify this polymorphism's effect on body mass in our Caucasian cohort. At the same time, personal history of the subjects in correlation with the FTO genotypes provided important information on the FTO gene's influence on the feeding behavior and food selection of these individuals. In conclusion, the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism has been identified as a common gene variant in our Romanian Caucasian cohort, proving a high association with all the parameters of obesity and obesity comorbidities. The adherence to a Mediterranean diet is benefic for subjects with genetic predisposition for this disorder as long as it is kept for a long period of time along with sustained physical exercise. Association studies are an extremely important tool in understanding the hunger-satiety pathway, providing information on the relation between obesity-related genes, gene expression and behavior. ","696":"Obstructive jaundice can raise problems to diagnostic imaging. The radiologist must choose the most appropriate examination that delivers the most important diagnostic information because the differences between a lithiasic obstruction and a tumoral one are vital. This information helps the surgeon speed up the process of decision-making, because the treatment may be very different in relation to the nature of the obstruction. This study tries to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in detecting the obstacle in the common bile duct (CBD) and the possibility of establishing the lithiasic nature of the obstruction. A retrospective analysis was analyzed during an interval of 18 months that included jaundice patients admitted in the General Surgery Department of \"Coltea\" Clinical Hospital. They were examined by CT scanning and by MRCP, being suspected of choledocholithiasis. 63 patients were included in the study, 34 females and 29 males. 33 CT scans and 30 MRCP exams were performed. CT scan is useful in detecting residual or iterative choledocholithiasis in patients after cholecystectomy, contrast enhanced CT (CECT), being able to differentiate between lithiasic and non-lithiasic obstruction. MRCP delivers important anatomic details of the biliary tree; it is superior to CT in diagnosing the hepatocholedochal lithiasis; MRCP tends to replace endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)--the diagnostic \"gold standard\" reducing the number of unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures.

","698":"In medical practice, plastic surgeons confront with patients with sarcomas of the extremities that require a radical surgical approach. Knowing when to attempt limb-sparing surgery and when to give in to limb amputation is one of the most difficult decisions a surgeon can take. The correct approach and management of such cases ensure surgical success and the patient survival. In this paper, the case of a 56-year-old man, admitted in our clinic with a crush injury of the right calf and subsequent haematoma is presented. During haematoma drainage, the surgeon noticed abnormal tissue and performed an incisional biopsy. The patient was diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma of the external compartment of the right calf. Limb amputation was proposed, but the patient refused. After the clinical examination, blood tests and diagnostic imaging, which allowed the correct evaluation of the case-tumor sizes and neighboring tissue reports, and preoperatory radiotherapy, limb sparing surgery, respectively primary tumor excision was decided to be performed. Negative margins could not be obtained by 3 successive resections or by adjuvant chemotherapy. The presented case supports the idea that limb-sparing surgery is only applicable to carefully selected patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In some cases, radical excision involving even mutilating amputations may provide a better oncologic and functional result.","699":"Aging is associated with morphological and functional changes in the brain, resulting in the deterioration of cognitive performance. Growth factors like BDNF are suggested to be involved in the regulation of age-related processes in the brain. A novel dietary supplement produced from purified nerve cell proteins, N-PEP-12, has shown to share properties with naturally occurring peptide growth factors by stimulating neurite outgrowth and beneficial effects on neuronal survival and protection against metabolic stress in cell cultures. The current study investigates the effects of long-term intake on age-dependent memory decline by assessing cognitive performance and synaptic density. All the experiments were performed in aged Long Evans rats randomly assigned to saline or N-PEP-12 once daily by gavage over a period of three months. Behavioral tests were performed in the Morris Water Maze after one, two and three months of treatment. Histological examinations were performed in the hippocampal formation and in the entorhinal cortex by measuring the synaptic density. This study shows that the oral intake of N-PEP-12 has beneficial effects on the cognitive performance of aged animals and that these effects go along with an increase in the synaptic density. Thus, N-PEP-12 may help maintain memory and learning performance during the aging process.

As melatonin secretion is suppressed by light, this effect was examined on the offspring of the Wistar rat females exposed to continuous light (500 lux) during the second half of the pregnancy (day 12 to 21). Control rats were kept under a 12:12 light-dark cycle. The resulted male offspring have been behaviorally assessed for depression after postnatal day 60 by using Forced Swim Test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST). Animals resulted from the melatonin deprived pregnancies have developed an abnormal response in the TST, but a normal FST behavior. Also, TST active movement was different in the melatonin suppression group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that intrauterine melatonin deprivation might be linked to the depressive like behavior in adult male offspring.

Globally, during the last three decades, there has been an increasing incidence of the esophageal cancer, approx. 400,000 new esophageal cancers being currently diagnosed annually. This represents the eighth leading cause of cancer incidence and the sixth leading cause of cancer death overall. Taking into account the population's global aging and thus, the increase in the number of patients who will not bear surgery, PCT and radiation, or the fact that they do not want it especially because of deficiencies and associated pathology, the endoscopic ablative techniques with palliation purposes represent the alternative. If we refer to the Western Europe countries and North America, we notice an increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma rate versus squamous cancer. As for the Asian region, referring in particular to China and Japan, 9 out of 10 esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. For at least half of the patients with EC (esophageal cancer) there is no hope of healing because of the advanced regional malignant invasion (T3-4, N+, M+) with no chemo and radiotherapy response, poor preoperative patients' conditions or systemic metastasis. The low life expectancy does not justify the risky medical procedures, the goal of the therapy consisting in the improvement of the quality of life by eliminating dysphagia (reestablishing oral feeding) which represents the most common complication of EC, the respiratory tract complication caused by eso-tracheal fistulas or by eliminating chest pain. To treat dysphagia, which is the main target of palliation, combined methods like endoscopic, chemo and radio-therapy, can be used, each one with indications, benefits and risks.","702":"Oligo-anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance characterizes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOs).

The rebalancing of the depressive patient, seen as a return to a normal level of psychosocial functioning and reduced risk of relapse is achieved with a prompt and constant support of specialized teams. Treatment should include psychopharmacological and psychosocial approaches, the results being interrelated and contributing to the prognosis of the disorder. Progress in clinical and pharmacological research, vivid dynamics of socio-economic environment, the complexity of diagnostic evaluation and the need for an interdisciplinary approach may cause difficulties in addressing the depressive patient and the ethical controversies.

","704":"The identification and biopsy of the sentinel lymph node has become a standard method of treatment for stage I and II breast cancer in the last decades, taking into account the fact that the management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer has evolved from the routine lymphadenectomy to a selective attitude, based on the histopathological evaluation of the sentinel lymph node, as well as on the tumor and on the patients' characteristics. Since the introduction of the method into clinical practice, in 1994, different methods of identification have been used (radioisotope injection, vital blue dye, or, more recently, lipophilic contrast agent for ultrasound visualization or paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) or the method of indocyanine green fluorescence), each presenting certain limits, but the radioisotopic method proving the most accurate. Moreover, during the development of the method, beside the standard indications specific for T1 or T2 breast tumor, without clinical or imagistic axillary adenopathies, their extension to a series of other particular situations such as the following, has been tried: ductal carcinoma in situ, multicentre tumors, after excisional biopsy or tumors preoperatively treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of the paper is to present the progress made regarding the current stage in the use of sentinel lymph node technique in breast cancer, while mentioning the established indications, as well as the ones that are still debating and need further studies.

They are characterized by narrow therapeutic indices and inter-individual or intra-individual variability in response to the treatment. to establish the influence of several genetic factors on VKA efficacy and adverse reactions. The metabolism of VKA differs depending on their chemical structure: indandiones derivatives (fluindione) or coumarin derivatives (acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon or warfarin). They are mostly metabolized in hepatocytes via a monooxygenase, cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), resulting in inactive products. The gene encoding CYP2C9 is polymorphic, its genetic variants being associated with differences in the enzymatic activity of CYP2C9. The most important in terms of their frequency in the general population are CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. Both alleles are associated with a marked decrease in CYP2C9 enzyme activity. VK epoxide reductase (VKOR) is an enzyme with an important role in VK metabolism. Various polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene have been described. VKORC1*2 haplotype seems to be the most important in relation to the variability in response to VKA. Various studies have shown a relationship between the genotype and the mean warfarin maintenance dosing: in patients carrying 2C9*1\/*2 alleles, the dose is reduced by 18-40% in patients carrying 2C9*2\/*2 alleles, by 21-49% in patients carrying 2C9*1\/*3 alleles. The A allele of the c.-1639G&gt;A polymorphism in the VKORC1 gene is associated with the need for a lower dose of acenocoumarol in patients on anticoagulant therapy.

In addition, last but not least, the judicious use of available resources. ","707":"Up to the middle of the last century, the thoracic spine, especially in its upper part, has been considered an unapproachable site, a no-man's land, but the constant evolution of medicine imposed techniques of the spine at these levels in order to solve a large area of pathology (infectious, tumoral, traumatic, and last but not least, deformative). This way, a series of anterior approaches allowed surgeons to gain access to the anterior part of the spine and the posterior mediastinum. The approaches described by Hodgson, Mirbaha or transthoracic transpleural approach (T4-T11), are enumerated. The idea to allow a more visible and extensive approach, but to avoid respiratory issues due to the lesion of the pleura, led to the description of a new anterior approach by Burnei in 2000. Burnei's approach represents an anterior approach to the thoracic spine, being a transthoracic and retropleural one. This approach allows a large area of spinal pathology due to infectious, traumatic, tumoral and degenerative (idiopathic or congenital scoliosis) causes. Statistically, this approach has been performed more frequently in cases of spinal instrumentation after diskectomy, in order to perform a partial correction of severe, rigid idiopathic scoliosis with more than 70 degrees Cobb and in cases of congenital scoliosis for hemivertebra resection and somatic synthesis to correct the scoliotic curve. This kind of anterior approach allows the surgeon a large visibility of the anterior thoracic spine, diskectomies of up to 5 levels to tender the curve of the deformity and to ensure somatic or\/ and transpedicular synthesis of up to 6 thoracic vertebrae. By performing a thoracotomy involving the resection of the posterior arches of the ribs, a thoracoplasty is also ensured with functional and aesthetic effects, by ameliorating the thoracic hump due to the scoliotic deformity. Burnei's approach joins all the other anterior approaches of the spine, addressing a large area of pathology of the thoracic spine. Even if difficult to be performed, requiring a thorough and perfect technique in the hands of a skilled surgeon, it will ensure satisfaction due to the detailed and visible exposure of the thoracic spine.

This is the eighth leading cause of cancer incidence and the sixth leading cause of cancer death overall. If we refer to the countries of Western Europe and North America, we could see an increase in the esophageal adenocarcinoma in detriment of squamous cancer. As for the Asian region, referring in particular to China and Japan, 9 out of 10 esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Considering that the incidence of gastric cancer in Japan is very high, the endoscopic screenings performed inevitably led to an increased rate of early detection of esophageal cancer, reaching approximately 20% of all esophageal cancers detected. This has led to the possibility of developing therapeutic endoscopic techniques with radical visa that we will describe while presenting comparative data from literature. Currently, however, there are not enough data on the effectiveness of these types of therapies, compared to surgery, in order to be transformed into standard therapeutic endoscopic treatment for early esophageal cancer.

But, as the data from trials have been published, doubts about the indications and efficacy of established treatments have arisen. In fact, there is probably no single aspect of early CM that has not given birth to controversy.

The anatomy of the Fallopian tube is complex starting from its embryological development and continuing with its vascular supply and ciliated microstructure, that is the key to the process of egg transport to the site of fertilization. There are many strongly documented causes of tubal infertility: infections (Chlamydia Trachomatis, Gonorrhea, and genital tuberculosis), intrauterine contraceptive devices, endometriosis, and complications after abdominal surgery, etc. Although there are still many controversies about the etiology of tubal sterility with the advent of molecular diagnosis of infections there has been cleared the pathway of infection through endometriosis or through ciliary immobility towards the tubal obstruction.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography has widely become the first choice in liver tumor assessment, as it is faster, simpler and safer than other forms of diagnostic imaging. On the other hand, cross sectional computed tomography is frequently employed when a hepatic formation is suspected of malignancy and allows a more accurate characterization of lesions through multiphasic multi-detector computed tomography technology. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging represents another addition to the wide range of diagnostic and prognostic techniques available for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and is currently regarded as one of the best tools for the characterization of these lesions.

","717":"Varus or valgus deviations of the femoral neck in osteogenesis imperfecta have been an ignored chapter because the classic correction procedures were applied in medical practice with unsatisfying results. Until the use of telescopic rods, coronal deviations remained unsolved and the distal configuration of the proximal femoral extremity remained uncorrected or partially corrected, which required an extensive use of the wheel chair or bed immobilization of the patient. The concomitant correction of the complex deformities, coxa vara\/valga and femoral integrated configuration, have been a progress which allowed the patients to walk with or without support. The purpose of this study is to present the Burnei's technique, a therapeutic alternative in deformity corrections of the varus or valgus hip in children with osteogenesis imperfecta. The paper is about a retrospective study done in a single center, which analyses Burnei technique and other procedures described in literature. The content of the article is based on a 12 years experience on a batch of 51 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta from which 10 patients (13 hips) presented frontal plane deviations of the femoral neck. All the patients with osteogenesis imperfecta who presented coxa vara or valga were submitted to investigations with the purpose of measuring blood loss, the possibility of extending the surgical intervention to the leg, the association of severe deformities of the proximal extremity of the femur and the necessity of postoperative intensive care. Burnei's technique: The operation was first performed in 2002. A subtrochanteric osteotomy was made in an oblique cut, from the internal side to the external side and from proximal to distal for coxa vara, or by using a cuneiform resection associated with muscular disinsertions. Only telescopic rods were used for osteosynthesis. There are a few articles in literature, which approach corrections of vara or valgus deviations in osteogenesis imperfecta. Some of them are the techniques described by Finidori, Wagner and Fassier. Burnei's technique is simple; it corrects the varus and valgus deviations concomitantly with Sofield-Millar. Even though only a telescopic rod is used, no stress fractures were seen postoperatively, deviation recurrence or assembly loss.

","719":"Pathological conditions states such as stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia are associated with increased levels of free radicals that alter normal function of the vascular endothelium and perturb vascular homeostasis. The redox couples reduced glutathione (GSH)\/oxidized glutathione (GSSG), NADH\/NAD+, and NADPH\/NADP+ play major functions in the intracellular redox balance. Any decrease in tissue or systemic GSH levels under the aforementioned pathologies would enhance oxidative damage to the vascular endothelium. Beside their role as coenzyme that participate in cellular metabolism, pyridine nucleotides serve also as substrate for enzymes involved in DNA repair and longevity. There is scant data on NAD+\/NADH kinetics and distribution during human cells proliferation. Here, we determined the influence of cellular GSH status on the early dynamics of nuclear-to-cytosol (N-to-C) NAD+ and nuclear NADH kinetics (6 h interval) over 72 h of endothelial cell proliferation. The IHEC cell line was used as a surrogate for human brain micro vascular endothelial cells. Inhibition of GSH synthesis by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and sustained low cellular GSH significantly increased nuclear NADH levels (p&lt;0.01), which correlated with lower nuclear GSH and prolonged cell cycle S-phase. When BSO was removed the pattern of nuclear NAD+ resembled that of control group, but nuclear NADH concentrations remained elevated, as in GSH deficient cells (p&lt;0.01). The coincidence of high nuclear NADH and lower nuclear NAD+ with S-phase prolongation are suggestive of CtBP and NAD+-dependent DNA repair enzyme activation under conditions of decreased cellular GSH. These results provide important insights into GSH control of vascular endothelial growth and restitution, key processes in the restoration of the endothelium adjacent to the post-injury lesion site.","720":"From the three Eustachian tube (ET) functions: middle ear protection, secretion clearance and middle ear ventilation, the ventilatory function is unanimously considered the most important one, because proper hearing is established only when tympanic membrane compliance is normal. This requires equilibrium between the middle ear and ambient gas pressure, which makes the normal functioning of active ET opening of critical importance. There are several methods and tests that can assess such a complex and variable mechanism. Sonotubometry is one such method; despite the fact that it has been continuously improved in the last 20 years, it is not yet systematically used to evaluate the ET ventilatory function, because its measurement pattern, context mapping (patient, clinic data, medication, treatment), validation, reproducibility and value for clinic practice, have not yet been fully consolidated and integrated in a knowledge-based, service-oriented system, that can provide decision support or even diagnostic. The paper reviews the role of tubal sonometry as a non-invasive, physiologic and easy to use method in assessing the ventilatory function and investigates the validity and reproducibility of a measuring pattern and test in a group of children. The paper describes the test pattern used, and the computer-based platform based on: (1) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for sound acquisition and low-level processing; (2) Artificial Intelligence techniques to extract significant sound features from sonotubograms and learn a manifold context database.

Prosthetics are made individually, personalized according to sex, age, physiological characteristics, profession and preference. In our country, thoracic limb prosthetics has a relatively short-recorded history of approximately a century, the most preeminent centers being in Iasi, Cluj and Bucharest. Currently, thoracic limb prosthetics, and particularly hand prosthetics, are in a period of development. A technique for amputation and stump reamputation called \"circumferential osteoneuromioplasty\" (CONM) is currently being used in the Orthopedics and Trauma Clinic of the Central Military University Emergency Hospital in Bucharest. The method was created with the purpose of obtaining distinct myoelectric signals of better quality, following the contraction of each muscle.

","722":"Supracondylar fractures of the humerus represent a current concern in the child's and adolescent's osteo-articular pathology. Even though orthopedic reductions are made correctly, fractures can become displaced when managed only by cast immobilization and complications may arise. The most frequent complications encountered in \"Prof. Dr. Alexandru Pesamosca\" Clinique, Bucharest, Romania, due to supracondylar humeral fractures, are valgus or varus deviations with angles that can sometimes exceed 40 degrees as a result of malunion. Varus or valgus deformations were rarely encountered after surgical treatment. The goal of this study is to present an alternative surgical technique to correct varus and valgus deformations as well as malrotation. The study is a retrospective analysis of a 96 children study group surgically managed during 1985 and 2013. In the first period, various surgical techniques have been performed: cuneiform resections, step-cut osteotomies, open wedge osteotomies with external fixation, epiphysiodesis, hemichondrodiatasis and Pesamosca metaphyseal diaphyseal osteoplasty. Starting with 2005, all the cases that presented such complications--28 out of 96 (29.1%)--were managed with the Pesamosca procedure. Due to the malunion of supracondylar humeral fractures only varus or valgus deformities were admitted in the study. The malunion due to the pathologic fractures encountered in osteogenesis imperfecta or fibrous dysplasia was precluded. The experience accumulated with the other surgical techniques used in 68 out of 96 patients (70.9%) determined us to exclusively use the Pesamosca osteoplasty following the year 2005, seeing the simplicity and the efficiency of this procedure. The outcome was very good. In 5 cases out of the 28 (17%) an apparent residual elbow was encountered and one case of relapse (3%) was noted due to inadequate term of cast immobilization. The elbow's mobility was completely recovered, the thoracic member's axis was appropriate and the metaphyseal diaphyseal osteotomy site healed completely in 3 months' time. Compared to other surgical techniques, the Pesamosca technique offers to the surgeon the possibility of correcting the varus or the valgus deformity as well as the malrotation in a simple, secure and efficient manner.

Current guidelines advocate for early and aggressive primary prevention and treatment of risk factors in high-risk populations but this excess risk is under-addressed in RA in real life. This is mainly due to difficulties met in the correct risk evaluation. This study aims to underline the differences in results of the main cardiovascular risk screening models in the real life rheumatoid arthritis population. In a cross-sectional study, patients addressed to a tertiary care center in Romania for an biannual follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis and the ones who were considered free of any cardiovascular disease were assessed for subclinical atherosclerosis. Clinical, biological and carotidal ultrasound evaluations were performed. A number of cardiovascular disease prediction scores were performed and differences between tests were noted in regard to subclinical atherosclerosis as defined by the existence of carotid intima media thickness over 0,9 mm or carotid plaque. In a population of 29 Romanian rheumatoid arthritis patients free of cardiovascular disease, the performance of Framingham Risk Score, HeartSCORE, ARIC cardiovascular disease prediction score, Reynolds Risk Score, PROCAM risk score and Qrisk2 score were compared. All the scores under-diagnosed subclinical atherosclerosis. With an AUROC of 0,792, the SCORE model was the only one that could partially stratify patients in low, intermediate and high-risk categories. The use of the EULAR recommended modifier did not help to reclassify patients. The only score that showed a statistically significant prediction capacity for subclinical atherosclerosis in a Romanian rheumatoid arthritis population was SCORE. The additional calibration or the use of imaging techniques in CVD risk prediction for the intermediate risk category might be warranted.

The macroscopic and microscopic examination of the resected specimens was also processed for genetic analysis in NIRDPBS, where KRAS status was determined by using two methods: PCR-RFLP and pyrosequencing. The clinical and biological parameters of the patients were assessed for 72 months in average. A relapse in 21 patients and a 5-year survival rate of 79.3% was discovered. The genetic analyses of KRAS gene found mutations in 22 cases (45.3%): 17 cases had mutations in codon 12, 5 cases in codon 13. The survival rate analyses of patients with wild KRAS gene compared with the patients carrying the mutation on codon 12 \/13 revealed a superposition of the survival curve. The statistical analysis based on the TNM stage revealed different survival curves in stage I and II, shorter survival period in patients with KRAS mutation on codon 13 than in those with wild type gene (stage I--p_value=0.015; stage II--p_value=0.000). It was not found that KRAS gene status had any prognostic significance. Nevertheless, for stage I and II patients, the mutation found on codon 13 determined a statistic significant shorter survival rate than for those with wild type. The results obtained by using the pyrosequencing method for the determination of KRAS gene status proved that it represented a reliable and reproducible method.

A cross-sectional study was performed on 30 completely edentulous patients, 53% male and 47% female, aged between 53 and 84. The evaluation of the salivary parameters (oral hydration index, pH and salivary flow, viscosity and saliva buffer capacity) was performed with the Saliva Check Buffer kit (GC Corporation). The salivary changes encountered were the following: low hydration level (63%), high saliva viscosity (57%), below-average pH (27%), reduced salivary flow (77%) and low saliva buffer capacity (80%). A reduced salivary flow and saliva buffer capacity was found in women. A lower buffer capacity of the saliva was found in patients with respiratory and gastro-intestinal disease. The alterations of the salivary flow are relatively frequent in geriatric patients, removable denture wearers, with compromised systemic status. These changes may be a risk factor for denture stomatitis and oral candidiasis, with a negative effect on the patient's comfort and quality of life.

The prognosis of patients with metastatic MM is grim, with a 5-years survival rate between 5-19%, and is dictated by the location and the number of metastases. We aimed to estimate the survival of patients with metastatic MM from our study and find out if the metastasis' location influences survival. Between 2008 and 2013, 155 patients with cutaneous MM were diagnosed in our clinic. All the patients were staged according to 2009 AJCC staging system. The median follow-up period was of 24 months. Survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method with a confidence level of 95%. 40.5% of the patients developed metastases in different organs, especially the brain. 80.6% of those with metastases died during the study. The median overall survival, estimated for the entire group of patients who developed metastases, was of 5.3 months. The influence of metastases distribution on the overall survival was examined and it was noticed that there were statistically significant differences between the risks of death of various groups of patients, depending on metastasis topography. Thus, the death probability of a patient with brain metastases is twice that of a patient with digestive metastasis, about 7 times higher than that of a patient with lung metastasis (p=0.0004) and 12 times higher than the death risk of a patient with extra-regional lymph nodes or subcutaneous metastasis (p=0.0000).

These changes occur in the blood flow (venous stasis), changes in the vascular wall (hypotonia, endothelial lesion) and changes in the coagulation factors (increased levels of factor VII, factor VIII, factor X, von Willebrand factor) and decreased activity levels of natural anticoagulants (protein C, protein S). In this study, we tried to determine a possible association between thrombosis and inherited thrombophilia in pregnant women. This is a retrospective study of 151 pregnant women with a history of complicated pregnancy: maternal thrombosis and placental vascular pathology (intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, recurrent pregnancy loss), who were admitted in our hospital during the period January 2010 to July 2014. We performed genetic analyses to detect the factor V Leiden mutation, the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene, the C677T mutation and the A1298C mutation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. The risk of thrombosis in patients with factor V Leiden is 2.66 times higher than the patients negative for this mutation (OR 2.66 95% CI 0.96-7.37 P=0.059). We did not find any statistical association with mutations in the MTHFR gene. Pregnant women with a family history of thrombosis present a 2.18-fold higher risk of thrombosis (OR 2.18 CI 0.9-5.26 P=0.085). Of 151 pregnant women, thrombotic events occurred in 24 patients: deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and ischemic stroke. The occurrence of thrombotic events was identified in the last trimester of pregnancy, but especially postpartum. Thrombosis in pregnancy is a redoubtable complication requiring an excellent cooperation between the obstetrician and anesthesiologist.

The estimated incidence is of less than 1 per 1,000.000 live births and represents a significant challenge to the pediatric and orthopedic surgeons in order to establish a diagnosis and to elaborate a management plan. We had the opportunity of treating many children who were afflicted by overgrowth syndromes and have been previously misdiagnosed as Proteus Syndrome in our department of pediatric and orthopedic surgery of \"Maria Sklodowska Curie\" Clinical Emergency Hospital for Children. This study helped us develop a diagnostic for these patients and report the first case of a confirmed PS in Romania. We report the case of a 5-year-old white male who is in the attention of the clinic since birth. He presented with multiple overgrowth bone segments, fatty subcutaneous or intraabdominal tumors and other connective tissues abnormalities. All the tests performed confirmed the diagnosis of PS at the age of 4 and the management is still to be decided.

In these cases, more aggressive surgical procedures are needed in order to obtain a good control of the disease. The case of a 50-year-old patient diagnosed with locally advanced cervical cancer invading the right ureter is presented, in whom this aspect was present even after neo-adjuvant chemoirradiation and in whom a total radical hysterectomy with bilateral en bloc adnexectomy with partial cystectomy and the invaded zone of the right ureter was performed.

The prognosis is good, with an adequate root canal treatment; it depends on the severity of the periodontal disease, appropriate healing time and the response to the treatment. A correct diagnosis is sometimes difficult; an accurate identification of the etiologic factors is important for an adequate treatment. Primary perio-endo lesion may heal after a proper disinfection and sealing of the endodontic system, the one-year follow-up radiograph showing bonny repair. Invasive periodontal procedures should be avoided at that moment.

Some multiple sclerosis patients complain of poor vision although the Snellen visual acuity is 20\/20. This study reveals that sensitive measurements like visual evoked potential (VEP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can evidence subclinical disturbances of visual pathway. These methods examine the relation between the visual function (VEP) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, as a structural biomarker for axonal loss in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The findings in this study indicate the utility of combining structural and functional testing in clinical research on patients with MS. To detect visual impairment in a population of visually asymptomatic patients affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and to compare the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) versus visual evoked potentials (VEP). Fourteen patients (28 eyes) affected by clinically definite MS, without a history of optic neuritis and asymptomatic for visual disturbances, were initially fully examined (visual acuity, ocular fundus, biomicroscopy) from an ophthalmic point of view and then measured by OCT (RNFL thickness) and VEP. Patients with a history of glaucoma or other retinal or optic nerve disease were excluded. Of fourteen patients (28 eyes), VEP was abnormal in 11 cases (78,57%) and OCT (RNFL thickness) was abnormal in 5 cases (35,71%), while 3 patients had no abnormalities on neither tests. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is less sensitive than visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in detecting visual subclinical impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). VEP remains the preferred test for the detection of clinical and subclinical optic neuritis. OCT may provide complementary information to VEP in cases with clinical definite MS and represent a valuable research instrument for the study of optic nerve disease in populations. The findings in this study reveal the utility of combining structural and functional testing in clinical research on patients with MS.

Data analysis was performed on a complex diagnosis and treatment of 56 patients with recurrent lumbar disc herniation who had previously underwent 1-3 lumbar disc surgeries. An MRI investigation with paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) was used for the diagnosis and differentiation of epidural fibrosis, and a dynamic lateral X-ray investigation was carried out for the identification of segmental instability. The evolution period after the previous surgery was between 1 and 3 years after the index surgery. Pain expression degree and dynamics were assessed with the pain visual analog scale (VAS) in early and late postoperative periods. Postoperative success was assessed by using a modified MacNab scale. The follow-up recording period after the last operation was of at least 1 year, ranging from 1 to 4 years. The surgical treatment was effective in most cases, recording a reduction in pain expression level from 7.2-7.7 points on the VAS scale to 1.7-2.1 in the early period and 2.2-2.6 in the late period (1 year). Repeated surgery was effective in 21 of 30 (70%) cases who underwent decompression surgery without fusion and in 20 of 26 (76.9%) cases who underwent repeated surgery with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). Overall, postoperative success was assessed by using a modified MacNab scale. Repeated surgery is a viable option for patients who have clinical manifestations of recurrent disc herniation. Investigation with contrast agent by MRI allows differentiating disk herniation recurrences from epidural fibrosis. Supplementing repeated discectomies and decompression with intervertebral transforaminal fusion provide superior clinical outcomes, especially in patients with clinical and radiological signs of lumbar segment instability.

Since capsule lacks the capability of taking biopsies, a diagnosis of colon cancer usually requires a further confirmation by colonoscopy. A series of seven patients who had highly suspicious lesions at capsule endoscopy (five-colon tumors, one gastric tumor and one small bowel tumor) and in whom the clinical decision and treatment was solely based on capsule findings, are presented. The diagnosis of cancer was confirmed in all cases by surgery and histology. In selected patients with a high index of clinical suspicion of cancer, PillCam colon 2 capsule endoscopy might be a sufficient tool for diagnosis. ","737":"Acute pancreatitis is a serious disease. Many clinical and laboratory prognostic scores for the severity of acute pancreatitis have been proposed over the years. The aim was to identify the biological factors of prognostic severity. The study was prospective, including a four-year period between 2007 and 2010. 103 patients were diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis and treated in a surgical clinic in Bucharest. 58 were males, accounting for 56.31%, and 45 were women, 43.69% respectively. Numerous biochemical analyses of blood, especially the number of leukocytes, glucose, urea and bilirubin were monitored. They proposed generic profiles for patients with severe acute pancreatitis. There is no single biological prognostic factor, but a combination of different markers may contribute to a more precise prediction of severity, as confirmed by international literature. ","738":"Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumour occurring in women in the reproductive age. It is typically found during the middle and later reproductive years. The prevalence quoted in literature ranges from 20-50% based on post mortem studies. The symptoms usually reported by women with fibroids are the following: abnormal gynaecologic haemorrhage, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, as well as urinary and bowel symptoms, urinary frequency or retention and, in some cases, infertility. During pregnancy, premature labor might be caused, interfering with the position of the fetus or abortion could be induced. However, only 30% of the women develop symptoms, most of them being asymptomatic. It was proved that the factors that can cause fibroids are the following: genetic, hormonal, and growth factors, especially transforming the growth factor beta (TGFb)-related cellular changes. As diagnosis tools, studies are revealing that ultrasound has been shown to be an insufficient method of myoma mapping, and magnetic resonance imaging should be preferred for surgical therapy planning. The contour of the endometrial cavity is delineated by using trans vaginal ultrasound and saline infusion hysterosonography, but hysteroscopy is the gold standard to evaluate the uterine cavity. ","739":"Tracheoesophageal fistula most commonly occurs as a complication of prolonged tracheal intubation. The incidence decreased after the use of low pressure and high volume endotracheal cuffs, but the intensive care units continue to provide such cases. The abnormal tracheoesophageal communication causes pulmonary contamination (with severe suppuration) and impossibility to feed the patient. The prognosis is reserved, because most patients are debilitated and ventilator dependent, with severe neurological and cardiovascular diseases. The therapeutic options are elected based on respiratory, neurological and nutritional status. The aim of conservative treatment is to stop the contamination (drainage gastrostomy, feeding jejunostomy) and to treat the pulmonary infection and biological deficits. Endoscopic therapies can be tried in cases with surgical contraindication. Operation is addressed to selected cases and consists in the dissolution of the fistula, esophageal suture with or without segmental tracheal resection associated. Esophageal diversion is rarely required. The correct indication and timing of surgery, proper surgical technique and postoperative care are prerequisites for adequate results. ","740":"Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as a chronic pain condition characterized by a burning sensation in the clinically healthy oral mucosa. It is difficult to diagnose BMS because there is a discrepancy between the severity, extensive objective pain felt by the patient and the absence of any clinical changes of the oral mucosa. This review presents some aspects of BMS, including its clinical diagnosis, classification, differential diagnosis, general treatment, evolution and prognosis. ","741":"The occurrence of colorectal cancer is related to the interaction that takes place at several levels between hereditary factors, environmental and individual ones. Understanding the molecular basis is important because it can identify factors that contribute to the initiation of development, maintenance of progression but also determine the response or resistance to antitumor agents. Understanding colorectal cancer at the molecular level has provided data used for genetic tests of family forms, it defined predictive markers used to select patients susceptible to certain forms of therapy and also for the development of molecular diagnostic tests to detect early non-invasive cancers.","742":"Dental Dam is the safest and most efficient isolation technique in endodontics and restorative dentistry, but it also used in esthetics, orthodontics, prosthetics, pedodontics and periodontology (for teeth immobilization). While in most cases the standard clamps are efficient, in some clinical situations clamp adaptation is mandatory in order to assure a tight contact on the tooth. The purpose of this study is to list the elements of the clamp, which should be modified in order to assure a secure constriction of the clamp on the anchor tooth, by using the carved gypsum cast method. 100 patients were examined, diagnosed and treated for various diagnoses like simple decay, gangrene, chronic apical periodontitis, and endodontic retreatments. The clamps used in this study were produced by Hu-Friedy, Hygenic, KKD, SDI, Hager &amp; Werken. In 10 cases, the anchor tooth did not provide enough stability to the standard clamp--as provided by the producer. Therefore, we have done some adjustments to some of the elements of the clamp: the arch, the wings, the plateau, the active area, and the contact points. In 6 cases, major clamp adaptations on carved gypsum cast were imperative. The classic clamps cannot provide a grip to be enough in all the clinical cases due to the huge variety and position and implantation of the anchor teeth. Therefore, in such situations, the clamps should be adapted in order to provide stability and assure the safe isolation during the treatment. The modified clamps will be useful in similar cases, so they must be kept. ","743":"Melatonin is an indoleamine produced by the pineal gland and secreted in a circadian manner. In the past few decades, research over this topic has been enhanced. Melatonin has many important roles in the human physiology: regulator of the circadian rhythms, sleep inducer, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic. This paper reviews the involvement of melatonin in embryo fetal development. The pineal gland develops completely postpartum, so both the embryo and the fetus are dependent on the maternal melatonin provided transplacentally. Melatonin appears to be involved in the normal outcome of pregnancy beginning with the oocyte quality and finishing with the parturition. Its pregnancy night-time concentrations increase after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly high levels after 32 weeks. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the embryo and fetus since early stages. There is solid evidence that melatonin is neuroprotective and has a positive effect on the outcome of the compromised pregnancies. In addition, chronodisruption leads to a reproductive dysfunction. Thus, the influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to the entertaining of circadian rhythmicity, but further studies are needed. ","744":"Atherosclerosis, one of the main causes of cardiovascular diseases, is a complex process that involves manifold factors. Besides the vascular lipids accumulation, inflammatory factors could be considered as a proatherogenic factor - RCAN1. RCAN1 is a regulator of calcineurin, both of them being calcium dependent proteins. Recent studies have shown that RCAN1 has an important role in heart valve development. In the same time researchers found that, the atherosclerotic plaques have an up-regulated RCAN1 gene expression. In the near future, it is desirable to elucidate the RCAN1 function and classify it as a possible biochemical marker to diagnose infancy atherosclerosis.","745":null,"746":"Part of the large group of nutritional and toxic optic neuropathies, tobacco-alcohol optic neuropathy is a disease often underdiagnosed or detected at a stage when the full recovery of vision is not possible.

Frequently cases with esophagogastric cancer are handled with preoperative chemotherapy [the more typical European method] or mixed chemoradiotherapy. The present research examines a comparison of overall retention and disease-free retention among gastric cancer cases managed via two Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant methods. We showed the features of quick gastric neoplasms operated by ESD. This research showed that ESD for quick gastric neoplasms is a typical approach since the en bloc and curative resection percentages are very high, and residual infection or recurrence is limited. Nevertheless, we further demonstrated that the obstacles connected to this method are the long method time and comparatively high rates of procedure-related developments. We should explore methods to reduce the method time and reduce these difficulties.","774":null,"775":"The importance of efficiency and improvement of health service for resolving people's health requirement and meeting their expectation is increasing.

Objectives: Due to the importance of a proper training to accomplish an accurate and fast intubation by the student of anesthesia, this research was conducted to assess the effects of DL and video laryngoscopy (Glidescope VL) training on the success rate of tracheal intubation by low-skill students. Materials\/Patients and styles: 50 undergraduate students of anesthesiology took part in this randomized control educational intervention. Having no considerable experience in intubation, they were selected and divided randomly into two equal groups (n = 25); video-laryngoscopy via GlideScope VL and direct laryngoscopy (DL) via a Macintosh blade were prepared by the same experienced anesthesiologist. All the participants practiced intubation six times on the same mannequin within a routine airway situation. The maximum acceptable time for each intubation was 3 minutes and three times of successful intubation was considered as an appropriate intubation skill. The required time for laryngoscopy and intubation at each stage, the grade of glottis view, the reasons for an unsuccessful intubation and the amount of successful intubations were recorded and compared between groups. Results: There was a clear variation between the 2 teams, in all the steps, based on the required time for laryngoscopy and intubation (p = 0.0001). Data analysis was performed by using repeated measures data which demonstrated that the necessary time for laryngoscopy and intubation during the study was clearly lower in the GlideScope VL team (p = .0001). In first five rounds of training, the glottis view in the DL group was significantly better than in the VL group (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Based on the result of today' study, routine airway intubation by using GlideScope VL is significantly faster than direct laryngoscopy. It seems that further studies are needed to investigate the effect of the educational program on different laryngoscopy and intubation situations.","781":"Pain is considered as the fifth vital sign, and the need to control pain after surgery emphasizes its importance. Pain after surgery leads to unpleasant outcomes and effects on different mechanisms thus causes fundamental changes in the metabolism of the body of susceptible people. Accordingly, the current article aimed to compare two methods of pain control by the patient using PCA pumps compared to medicine injection to ease the pain by nurses. Methodology: In the current research, a single-blind clinical trial of 70 patients as nominees of undergoing open-heart surgery at Shiraz Ordibehesht Hospital during 12 months was examined. The patients randomly divided into two groups of 35 patients with pain control by analgesia pumps of PCA and by NCA. The pain intensity was analyzed by visual analog scale (VAZ) and the sedation degree was examined based on the factors such as the Richmond sedation, nausea and vomiting and respiratory depression induced by opioids and analgesic effects, arterial oxygen saturation, patient satisfaction, ventilation duration for up to 48 hours after surgery. For data analysis, statistical software SPSS was used. Results: No statistically clear distinction was seen in the status of nausea and vomiting as well as in the length of ventilation and the oxygen saturation status between the two groups. In none of the two groups, respiratory depression was observed. There was a statistically notable variation between the two teams regarding satisfaction level. Also, an increasing significant decline in pain intensity was noted in both groups at consecutive times. There was an experimentally meaningful distinction between the two teams regarding degree of sedation (P &lt; 0.001), such that the level of sedation in NCA group was higher (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The use of PCA pump in acute pain control after open cardiac surgery was better than the NCA. In the case of using the PCA pump, in addition to the psychological effect, the pump could control pain. Thus, the side effects of high dose injections would be reduced, and the increased use of the dose of drugs would not be detected.","782":"Background: The current study tried to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients residing in Tehran, Iran and it also tried to determine the average quality of life of patients.

Stroke is a type of nervous focal disorder that occurs suddenly because of acute vascular events. 113-149 out of 100000 persons (0.113-0.149%) face with stroke in Iran annually. This causes treatment costs and many disabilities. Recently, studies indicated that statins, as a class of drugs, could decrease the chance of stroke recurrence and probably disabilities after stroke onset. This paper presents the effects of previous statins consumption on NIHSS in patients hospitalized in Shahid Mohammadi Hospital of Bandar Abbas in 2014-5. Materials and methods. Based on the World Health Organization categorization, 140 patients suffered from stroke, experienced stroke once or more, and were older than 20 years old. They were studied with a simple convenience sampling in this descriptive study during 2014-5. The exclusion criteria were non-neurological vision disorders, ICH, and unwillingness of the patients to participate in the research. The patients were classified into two teams, one taking statin before the stroke onset (group A) and other taking no statins before stroke onset (group B). Patients were initially examined with the help of NIHSS rate measurement (using NIHSS rating standard questionnaire), type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and other demographic data. Then the data were inserted into SPSS 22 and descriptive statistical tests (median, mean and standard deviation), Spearman and Mann-Whitney tests, were used due to the abnormal distribution of the data. Results. 140 patients suffered from stroke (95 men (67.85%) and 45 women (32.14%)) with an average age of 67.9 years old, being studied in two groups (A and B). A direct correlation was seen between age and NIHSS (sig = 0.057) but it was not notable (P &gt; 0.05). There was no clear relationship among sex, number of prior stroke onsets, type of stroke, lipid profile (TG, Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL), blood sugar, underlying disease (diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart diseases), drug abuse and history of hospitalization in ICI with NIHSS rate (P &gt; 0.05). 106 patients (75.71%) have never taken any type of statin class of drugs and only 34 patients (24.28%) were taking these medications before the stroke. The difference between NIHSS rates of groups A and B was not clear and notable (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion. According to the findings of this research, taking statins before the onset of stroke and immediately after it showed no significant difference in the level of following dysfunction, measured with NIHSS, and further studies are necessary.","797":null,"798":"Objective: Carrying out the appropriate psychological interventions to improve vitality and mental well-being is critical.

Then they were appraised by CBCT, formal radiographs and the nondirect digital system for the disclosure of interproximal caries. Four oral and maxillofacial radiologists used a 4-point scale to assess the pictures for the existence or absence of proximal caries. Caries depth was specified by histological examination. The gathered data were assessed by SPSS software using Weighted Kappa and Friedman test. Results: Statistics demonstrated that the accuracy of the indirect digital system was somewhat better than conventional systems. The accuracy of the indirect digital system was better than cone beam system, and this difference was statistically significant. Conclusion: The digital system was better than CBCT in the disclosure of proximal caries. The formal radiography fell in between the two other systems without a statistically significant deviation in detecting caries. Thus, CBCT is not advised to detect proximal caries because of the higher radiation dose.","833":"Dexamethasone is an exceptionally applied glucocorticoid unfortunately prescribed too much. This drug is attached to its receptors in the cytoplasm by going through the cell layer, and opens the cell nucleus by the drug-receptor system, being ultimately responsible for systematic effects of corticosteroids. This study was conducted to explore the influence of dexamethasone on serum level of some biochemical parameters in adult men rats. 40 adult male rats were put into 4 test and check collections. The test collection only received saline and the experimental group received dexamethasone of 0.4, 0.7, and 1 mg\/ kg doses daily in the form of intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 mL\/ day. After serum separation, the serum value of cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lactate dehydrogenase were measured and the outcomes were examined by using SPSS and Dunnett software. The test of lipid profile and lactate dehydrogenase was done by using the biochemistry tools and the collections were examined.

The population of the study included the managers of statistic and medical records at the offices of vice-chancellor for treatment in 39 medical universities in Iran. Data were collected by using structured questioners. With regard to different kinds of designing information systems, sampling was done by two methods, BSP (based on processes of job description) and CSF method (based on critical success factors). The data were analyzed by SPSS-16. Results: Our study showed that 41% of information needs were found to be critical success factors of managers of office. The first priority of managers was \"the number of bed and bed occupancy in hospitals\". Of 29 identified information needs, 62% were initial information needs of managers (from the viewpoints of managers). Of all, 4% of the information needs were obtained through the form, 14% through both the form and database, 11% through the web site, and 71% had no sources (forms, databases, web site). Conclusion: Since 71% of the information needs of medical equipment offices managers had no information sources, the development of information system in these offices seems to be necessary. Despite the important role of users in designing the information systems (identifying 62% of information needs), other scientific methods is also needed to be utilized in designing the information systems.","866":"Although acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is more resistant to chemotherapy than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), significant progresses have been achieved over the last 20 years with an improvement in the long-term survival up to 50-60%. This may be attributed to the intensification of chemotherapy, including the increased use of stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in well-defined subgroups. Allo-HSCT represents an extremely effective alternative in pediatric AML treatment panel, but its efficiency is limited both by the toxic effects and by the difficulty of finding a matched HLA donor.

In a 43-year-old Caucasian male with a history of diarrhea and colics since young age, progressive sensory disturbances developed since age 18 years. At age 34, he was diagnosed as relapsing-remitting MS upon an inflammatory CSF-syndrome and non-specific white matter lesions and treated with interferon beta-1b during the next 8 years without effect. At age 35, axonal polyneuropathy and ataxia were diagnosed. Despite normal anti-gliadin, endomysial, and transglutaminase antibodies, CD was diagnosed at age 41, based upon the history, polyneuropathy, positivity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, the white matter lesions, and a beneficial response of the gastrointestinal problems and polyneuropathy to gluten-free diet. CD may mimic MS and may be present despite the absence of anti-gliadin, endomysial or transglutaminase antibodies. CD should be considered if there is a gastrointestinal problem, polyneuropathy, and ataxia, even if CSF and MRI findings are suggestive of MS.

Arthroplasties can be total or partial, cemented or uncemented. These procedures are generally indicated as a form of treatment for arthritic pain or in the case of severe trauma, such as femoral neck fractures. The most commonly used approaches are: Smith Peterson, Watson Jones, Hardinge, Moore Southern and Ludloff. Recently, mini-invasive approaches have started being used, while correlated with short femoral stems. Short metaphyseal femoral stems have been introduced as an alternative to conventional stems, having a series of advantages: preservation of bone stock (high cervical osteotomies), preservation of the anatomical anteversion of the femural neck, decrease in cortical stress forces, decrease in the remaining thigh pain, a longer life of the prosthesis, with the possibility of revision to a conventional prosthesis, and the possibility to be used in correlation with mini-invasive procedures. Short femoral stems implanted through a mini-invasive approach allow the conservation of the femoral bone stock, permitting an ulterior re-intervention, in the context of an ageing population, with a globally rising long-term survival rate. Moreover, the superiority of the total hip arthroplasty with a short femoral stem was discussed through mini-invasive approaches, in the day-to-day realities of our Clinic.","876":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has the ability to affect any organ in the body.

Multiple complications may occur if the lesion is not recognised intra operatively: hydronephrosis, anuria (bilateral lesion), ureterovaginal fistula, ileus, peritonitis. The rate of recognition of an intra operative ureter lesion is 30% and it could rise up to 90% when cystoscopy with ureteroscopy is used at the end of the intervention. The article presents the case of a 46-year-old patient with uterine fibromatosis, whose pelvic ureter was sectioned during surgery. The lesion was recognised during surgery because, at the end of each intervention, the diuresis was stimulated by injecting Furosemide in order to detect the lesions of the ureters and urinary bladder.","878":"The aim of this study is to present the main - surgical and non-surgical - therapeutic approaches (or methods) used in the treatment of pelvic bleeding of neoplastic origin. analysis of the materials found in the literature on this subject. Among the surgical methods used, hypogastric artery ligation is the oldest therapeutic approach in cervical bleedings of neoplastic origin. Due to the frequent recurrence of haemorrhages, mere ligation has been proven not to be sufficient, but necessitating the concomitant ligation of the lumbo-ovarian, round and uterosacral ligaments. In the case of severe bleedings, difficult to control, direct embolization of the hypogastric artery below the level of ligation is usually practiced. As for the non-surgical methods used, we chose to present uterine artery embolization and the application of haemostatic Mohs' paste. Uterine artery embolization consists in the permanent occlusion of the uterine arteries in neoplastic abundant haemorrhages, when the intervention includes the use of permanent embolic material. Stopping the bleeding within the first 24 hours from the embolization means that the intervention has been a success, and provides the patient with the possibility to continue the therapy protocol according to her stadialization. Recent studies of the Japanese researchers have indicated the possibility to use the Mohs' paste for haemostatic purposes on patients with cervical bleedings of medium intensity, in cases of advanced cervical cancer. With severe haemorrhages - occurring spontaneously or during surgery - the emergency haemostatic intervention consists in the bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. With long-lasting haemorrhages of medium intensity, we usually resort to uterine artery embolization, since this is a minimally invasive method and may also be performed with abundant bleeding under emergency pressure. The application of the Mohs' paste for haemostatic purposes is a new therapeutic method, whose efficiency cannot be yet estimated.

Noxious stimuli of a mechanical and thermal nature were applied on the left hindpaw during chloral hydrate anesthesia. The anesthetic depth was estimated through median frequency computation, which in that instance was of 2-3 Hz. Fronto-parietal functional cortical connectivity was assessed by using XAppEn. After data processing and analysis we observed an increase of fronto-parietal functional connectivity during mechanical and thermal noxious stimulation. In addition, MEF increased both in frontal and parietal areas during the mechanical and thermal stimulation compared to baseline.

The indication of metastasectomy is currently limited to patients undergoing treatment of the primary tumor. Resections for lung metastases of high selected patients with urogenital cancer present minimal risks and can prolong survival. Prognostic factors that determine which patients will benefit from surgery are still unclear. This article presents a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent lung metastases resection between 2008 and 2013 in our clinic. Among 148 patients, 8 (5.41%) had lung metastases after urologic cancers (UC), 18 (12.16%) after genital cancers (GC), 13 (8.78%) after breast tumors and 109 (73.65%) had lung metastases from other type of tumors. The overall 6 months survival was 100% for UC, 94.44 for GC, 84.62% for BC and 87.16% for others. The criteria for surgery proved to have a positive predictive value and what should be considered are the following: prolonged disease-free interval (DFI), unilateral disease, the absence of systemic pathologies, oncological margins resecability and less than 3 radioimagistic detectable metastases. A negative prognosis was observed in those with primary tumor in the cervix, at least 3 metastases and a tumor larger than 3 cm. To determine how to select surgical candidates for pulmonary metastasectomy more precisely, further analysis of prognostic factors is evident and the need for a prospective, randomized, multicenter study is clear.

For a rapid evaluation of the outcome in myelodysplastic patients non-cytogenetic prognostic scores can be used. This study proposed to demonstrate that age and gender are important factors in the outcome of the patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. This study was conducted in the Department of Hematology of the Emergency University Hospital Bucharest during October 2008 and October 2012. Male sex and age higher than 60 years are associated with high risk in the studied cases by using the Spanish prognostic score. According to Goasguen score: male sex and age, patients older than 60 years, present characteristics associated with an intermediate risk. Based on the Dusseldorf score, age over 60 years and female gender were associated with pronounced risk in the examined group. By examining the Bournemouth score in our group, we found that age &gt; 60 years correlated with a higher frequency of risk, but no significant differences regarding the sex of patients were observed. We concluded that age &gt; 60 years and male gender are important predisposing factors in the survival.

Several studies showed a negative impact of excessive BMI on testosterone levels, sexual function and sperm parameters. Possible mechanisms beyond this phenomenon are reduced hypothalamic and pituitary secretory function, excess estrogen production and reduced circulating sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Peptides produced by the adipocyte may also trigger modifications of the reproductive function. Independently of the method used, non-surgical approach or bariatric techniques, weight reduction and a return to a normal BMI have been associated with improvement in the sexual function and levels of sexual hormones in obese males, showing that obesity related hypogonadism is preventable.

The aim of this study is to describe the main characteristics in cases of patients critically traumatized, who were admitted in our emergency department. The study is based on a retrospective analysis of cases of major trauma admitted in an Emergency Department between 2004 and 2008. There were 201 cases of critically traumatized patients, who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patients were aged between 16 and 79, mostly men (67.16%), with a range of ISS between 30 and 75. Regarding the type of mechanism that produced the injury we noted a predominance of blunt trauma (87,2% of cases) and hypovolemia as a direct cause that led to the cardiac arrest. The first monitored rhythm was non-shockable for over 90% of the cases. In our group, 4 patients were discharged alive (2% of all cardiac arrest cases). The mechanism of cardiac arrest for those 4 cases were hypoxia through massive facial trauma in one case and tension pneumothorax through severe thoracic trauma in three cases. Given the low survival figures, all the efforts that could be achieved by an emergency team in the face of severe trauma had to be oriented towards the maintaining of the vital functions or, when needed, towards restoring life in order to enrich the operation theatre for the definitive care.

Our goal was to determine the superiority of the new method in terms of detection rates and subsequent postoperative treatment changes. A total of 320 NMIBT suspected consecutive cases were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria were represented by hematuria, positive urinary cytology and\/or ultrasound suspicion of bladder tumors. All patients underwent WLC and NBI cystoscopy. Standard transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) was performed for all lesions visible in WL and NBI guided resection for solely NBI observed tumors. The overall NMIBT and CIS patients' detection rates were significantly improved for the NBI evaluation ((94.9% versus 88.1% and 95.7% versus 65.2%). Also, on a lesions' related basis, NBI cystoscopy emphasized a significantly superior diagnostic accuracy concerning the CIS, pTa and overall NMIBT formations ((95.2% versus 60.3%, 92.8% versus 83.9% and 94.1% versus 82%). Additional tumors were diagnosed by NBI in a significantly higher proportion of CIS, pTa, pT1 and NMIBT patients (56.6% versus 8.7%, 28% versus 10.3%, 30.3% versus 10.6% and 31.6% versus 9.4%). As a result of these supplementary findings, the postoperative treatment was significantly improved in a substantial proportion of cases (15.4% versus 5.1%). NBI cystoscopy represents a valuable diagnostic alternative in NMIBT patients, with significant improvement of tumor visual accuracy as well as detection rates.

Among psychological factors considered important by study authors were the following: 1) the deficient instruction of the patient, 2) decreased treatment motivation, 3) a marginal social role, 4) a disadaptive cognitive style and 5) psychiatric comorbidity (especially anxiety and depression). Efficient interventions were, for physicians, 1) patient education and 2) designing a personalized self-management plan, and for the clinical psychologists, 1) cognitive-behavioral therapy, 2) biofeedback, 3) family therapy, 4) relaxation and 5) hypnosis. Despite the undeniable effect of these methods in selected cases, the high heterogeneity of designs and personal affiliations of researchers do not allow new generalizations about their efficacy or their routine implementation into PR.

The intent of this study was to determine the effects of physical activity on the life quality of cardiovascular patients after coronary artery bypass graft. This randomized clinical trial was performed on two groups of coronary artery patients of Yazd Afshar hospital. All the 70 participants were post surgery coronary artery patients who were divided into two groups. Data was collected by two questionnaires: A personal information questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire (SF=36). Data of both groups was collected in the first and fourth month after the discharge from surgery and sessions were analyzed by SPSS 16 and by using T-test and Chi-square. Results displayed that after the intervention, all the categories of the components of the quality of life were increased except for general health. There was no significant differentiation between these statuses in the control group and the premier grades about the components of the social function (88.98 out of 100). The comparison of total scores of the quality of life before the intervention showed the quality of life of both groups one month after surgery was not significant (p=75%), but in four months after surgery, the distinction between the mean grade scores of the intervention, the group was considerable (p=0.0001).

The purpose of this paper is to determine the prevalence and the clinical aspects of cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV\/AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) patients. The study is retrospective, conducted in the Ophthalmology Office of \"Matei Bals\" Infectious Diseases Hospital in Bucharest during the period August 1, 2007 - August 1, 2013. Each patient was examined thoroughly at the slit lamp biomicroscope by using a lens of 90D and a 20D lens using the indirect microscope after administration of topical mydriatics. 131 patients were followed for HIV \/ AIDS with posterior segment ocular involvement. 36.64% of the 131 patients having affected the posterior segment have been diagnosed with CMV retinitis. Doctors should be aware of the existence of ocular damage in HIV\/AIDS and to emphasize the importance of regular ophthalmologic examination of patients with HIV\/AIDS. ","909":"Taking into account the incidence and the severity of electrocutions, we consider it extremely necessary to find effective, appropriate and particularized therapeutic solutions aimed at improving the survival, decreasing the mortality, ensuring a superior functional and aesthetic effect and facilitating the social reintegration. Given the severity of the general condition of the electrically injured patient and the fact that any worsening of the lesions has a systemic echo, the selection of the timing for re-excision is very important. The postponement of the surgical timing can break the precarious metabolic equilibrium and can hasten the installation of the multisystem organ failure (MSOF). The study is intended to establish a possible connection between the clinical evolution of the electrically injured patient and the dynamics of three important biological parameters, able to provide data concerning the therapeutic attitude to be followed. The patients with a diagnostic of high-voltage electrocution, who will be admitted to the Clinic, will be followed for a period of 2 years. The parameters to be followed daily will be: - Creatin-kinase, as a marker of muscular damage. - Hemoglobin, as a marker of tissue oxygenation. - Leukocytes, as an indicator of a possible septic evolution. The therapeutic alternatives, including the administration of antiplatelet drugs will be studied. In the period October 2010-June 2013 a total of 12 cases of high-voltage electrocution were admitted in our clinic. Among these, some could be placed in the study of 7 cases, as the remaining patients died within the first 24 hours of hospitalization due to the endured lesions. All the patients were admitted to the ICU ward that supported the treatment and monitoring until their stabilization, at which time they were transferred to the ward. All the patients received anti-thromboxane treatment from their admission (injectable NSAIDs associated with antisecretory drugs). By mutual agreement with ICU service, Dipyridamole was not introduced because of the \"steal effect\" in the viable areas to the detriment of the already ischemic areas, the drug effect being obvious in vitro, but hard to be proven in the clinical case. The relationship between the CK level and the clinical appearance of the ischemic areas is relative. We cannot conclude that an increased level of CK is equivalent to an enlarged ischemic area and even less it does not provide us direct information concerning the best time for re-excision. The presence of a viable blood supply around the necrotic tissue will lead to an important resorption of degradation products in that area, a quasinormal level of CK having no value. The sealing of the necrosis areas and the lack of immediate resorption does not have a positive prognostic value. Taking into account that the electrocutions are mostly multiple injuries, the CK level can increase even after some muscular damages, fractures, independent of the actual electrocution lesion. In one case, the patient suffered from electrocution at both thoracic limbs. With the carbonization of the hands and grifa installed up to the level of the elbow fold, he stayed for 6 hours at the accident site until he had been recovered. At the moment of presentation to the hospital, his consciousness condition was satisfactory but the CK level was of over 20000 IU, becoming rapidly non-detectable, in combination with black urine. The patient's condition deteriorated quickly, and, although the bilateral shoulder disarticulation has been carried out, he died in the next 12 hours. As a conclusion, the CK level did not prove itself a prognostic for the surgical timing or the actual surgical attitude and could be influenced by a whole series of factors, dependent or not on the electrocution lesion. A radical attitude is to be preferred in cases with established ischemia; the prognostic being the more reserved the larger the damage and the longer the period of time from the event. The established treatment is of renal support and treatment of acute renal injury (AKI) subsequently installed. An increased level of leukocytes is always present as in any severe trauma, even if there are no immediate signs of infection of the electrocution lesions. Taking into account that the electrocution lesion as well as the one caused by burning destroys the natural defense barrier represented by the skin, the infection risk is major and that is why the therapeutic protocol stipulates the immediate establishment of a treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics or with an association of antibiotics. The increase of the leukocytes level under antibiotics treatment involves either the contamination with a germ that is not sensitive to the respective antibiotic or the persistence of necrosis areas which secondarily infect, and where antibiotic penetration is very low. Therefore, the excision of the compromised tissues is an absolute necessity. In terms of prognostic, the increase of the leukocytes number signified an insufficient excision and indicated the resuming and deepening of the excisions. Taking into account that the patient has been admitted through the ICU service, the risk of contracting severe infections with selected germs is real. Another risk is that of infection with Clostridium difficile following the prolonged utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in patients with associated diseases and reduced immunity per primam. The existence of completely separate circuits should solve the problem of contamination with bacteria of selected species; unfortunately, in our cases, we have faced this problem and the utilization of last choice antibiotics (Imipenem, Vancomycin, Targocid, etc.) as well as the association of immunoglobulins was necessary. All the patients admitted in the study received anti-thromboxane drugs in order to limit the ischemic process at tissue level. Despite the efforts we have made, the lack of blood and its derivatives or simply the negligence in patient monitoring, allowed the decrease, even transient of the Hb level, sometimes only for a few hours, but enough to allow the deepening of the ischemic lesions. Excisions were carried out in all the patients in emergency or even amputations of the extremities, with the wish to limit the extension of the ischemic lesions and the resorption of cell degradation products. The amputations performed in emergency did not always represent a saving solution; however, they remained the most effective measures when they were carried out immediately after the accident and obviously in viable tissue. The increase of CK is not an indicative factor itself in making re-excisions but orients the therapeutic approach, the utilization of the dialysis when the values do not decrease by treatment for renal support and the forcing of diuresis is required. The normalization of CK indicates the time when we can start the covering of the defects resulted as a consequence of the excisions. The level of the leukocytes represents both a prognostic factor and an indicative factor for the re-excision of the ischemic areas. An increased level under antibiotic therapy signifies either an incomplete excision or the contamination with flora resisting to the antibiotic that has been used. In the light of findings in the caring of the patients with electrocutions, I propose several caring\/assessment protocols for the severe electrically injured patient. ","910":"About 90% of the hand bone tumors are enchondromas. Treatment of choice is complete curettage and bone grafting, usually with bone autografts.

Clinical, surgical and pathological findings in this case are presented along with a brief discussion of literature. ","911":"Primary torsion of the omentus is an extremely unusual cause of acute abdomen in the pediatric population. This condition occurs from twist of the pedicle of the omental apron around its longer axis, leading to edema, ischaemia and necrosis. Here we present a rare case of a 9 year old girl referred by her general practitioner due to severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain with a presumed diagnosis of acute appendiceal inflammation. Surgical operation disclosed primary omental torsion. The infarcted segment was resected and the girl's clinical recovery was uneventful without any complication. The condition may mimic a variety of other causes of acute abdominal symptoms. In this case report, a presumed diagnosis of acute appendicitis urgently induced the decision of a surgical approach. Physicians involved in the acute pediatric care have to include this rare condition in the differential diagnosis of acute onset right-sided abdominal pain. ","912":"The aim of our study was to investigate the gene and serum protein expression profiles of IL-8 in colon cancer and associated hepatic metastasis and to correlate these results with clinicopathologic variables of the patients. IL-8 was evaluated by qPCR and ELISA in a total number of 62 colon cancer patients (n=42 by qPCR and n=20 by ELISA) in normal and tumoral tissue specimens and serum samples respectively. Additionally synchronous metastasis from 5 of these patients were also collected at the time of surgery and analyzed by qPCR. IL-8 was up regulated in all analyzed tumoral samples compared with normal tissue (P-value = 0.01) and higher expressed in metastatic tissues compared with tumoral tissues (P -value= 0.03). The median expression of IL-8 in patients over 60 years old was found to be higher compared with the median expression of IL8 in patients less than 60 years old (3.89 compared with 14.69, P -value= 0.005). According to tumor grading, we found that IL-8 in tumors with well differentiated adenocarcinoma have a median mRNA expression of 9.78 compared with a median mRNA IL8 expression of 26.63 in moderate or poor differentiated adenocarcinoma. Levels of IL-8 determined in serum were statistically significant correlated with preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level (P -value= 0.003, R=0.57) and with distant metastasis (P-value =0.008). Serum level of IL-8 increased proportionally along with TNM tumor stage and was found to be statistically significant correlated with C-reactive protein (P -value, R=0.64). Colon cancer patients had higher IL-8 levels as determined by ELISA (median value= 29.64 pg\/ml) compared with healthy controls (median value= 4.86 pg\/ml). Our results provide additional support for the role of inflammation in colon cancer and indicate that IL-8 could be further validated in association with other already used markers for prognostic and diagnostic of evolutional disease in colon cancer patients. ","913":"Treatment results evaluation (radical cystectomy and adjuvant chemo\/radiotherapy) in patients with urothelial carcinoma, squamous differentiation carcinoma and pure squamous bladder carcinoma. The study included 361 patients with invasive bladder carcinoma treated between 1990-2013. Histology showed 296 cases of urothelial carcinoma (82% - group A), 52 cases of urothelial divergent differentiation (squamous and urothelial carcinoma 14.4% - group B) and 13 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (3.6% - group C). All patients benefited from radical cystectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was undergone in 68 patients. Group A - urothelial carcinoma - had a 44% rate of patients alive with a mean survival period of 73 months. About 56% of the patients died, the mean survival period being 4 years. Group B - urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation - had a mean survival period of 36 months (between 1-156 months). 17 patients (33%) are alive at 50 months postoperatively. Group C - squamous carcinoma - had a mean survival period of 9.4 months. Locally advanced disease was diagnosed in 50% of the patients in group A, while in group B the rate was 84.6% and 70% in group C, respectively. Squamous pattern detected in the histopathological specimen represents a negative prognostic factor. It seems that the squamous component influences the outcome of the disease due to its biological characteristics in the evolution of squamous carcinoma, with advanced local stage disease at diagnosis - late onset of symptoms and lack of response to adjuvant treatment. ","914":"The global assessment of the evolution of a disease in a certain geographical area or a specific domain is useful in the medical research for the preparation of practice guidelines\/protocols used in the hospitals. Cirrhosis is one of the most common disorders seen today, occupying a significant place in the gastrointestinal pathology. The disease is the final stage of various affections in terms of etiology and morphology. The most frequent subjects treated on this topic are those related to the etiopathology and early diagnosis. Given the current interest in this matter and considering that UGS (upper gastrointestinal bleeding) in liver cirrhosis is a common complication and potentially fatal, the medical research found some very useful conducting retrospective studies in this area. The purpose of our study was to create an IT system implemented with Sentinel WebDashboard, which could increase the medical performances in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of a disease. We tested our solution on a medical data set containing information about the patients with liver cirrhosis. The solution facilitates the access of the physicians to the databases containing complete information about the patients, offers the possibility to monitor the evaluation of their health and also aids physicians in optimizing the medical procedures and improve the diagnostic methods.

The surgical elective treatment of cervical cancer is represented by the radical abdominal hysterectomy. In time, many surgeons perfected this surgical technique; the ones who stood up for this idea were Thoma Ionescu and Ernst Wertheim. There are many varieties of radical hysterectomies performed by using the abdominal method and some of them through vaginal and mixed way. Each method employed has advantages and disadvantages. At present, there are three classifications of radical hysterectomies which are used for the simplification of the surgical protocols: Piver-Rutledge-Smith classification which is the oldest, GCG-EORTC classification and Querlow and Morrow classification. The last is the most evolved and recent classification; its techniques can be adapted for conservative operations and for different types of surgical approaches: abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic or robotic.","919":"Reduced fetal growth is seen in about 10% of the pregnancies but only a minority has a pathological background and is known as intrauterine growth restriction or fetal growth restriction (IUGR \/ FGR). Increased fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity as well as adult pathologic conditions are often associated to IUGR. Risk factors for IUGR are easy to assess but have poor predictive value. For the diagnostic purpose, biochemical serum markers, ultrasound and Doppler study of uterine and spiral arteries, placental volume and vascularization, first trimester growth pattern are object of assessment today. Modern evaluations propose combined algorithms using these strategies, all with the goal of a better prediction of risk pregnancies.","920":"Apoptosis is an inborn process that has been preserved during evolution; it allows the cells to systematically inactivate, destroy and dispose of their own components thus leading to their death. This programme can be activated by both intra and extracellular mechanisms. The intracellular components involve a genetically defined development programme while the extracellular aspects regard endogenous proteins, cytokines and hormones as well as xenobiotics, radiations, oxidative stress and hypoxia. The ability of a cell to enter apoptosis as a response to a \"death\" signal depends on its proliferative status, the position in the cell cycle and also on the controlled expression of those genes that have the capacity of promoting and inhibiting cell death. The fine regulation of these parameters needs to be maintained in order to ensure the physiological environment required for the induction of apoptosis. Any malfunction in any of the steps of controlled cellular death can lead to dysfunctions and, as a consequence, to different pathological conditions. The importance of apoptosis lies in its active nature and in the potential of controlling biological systems. ","921":"A prospective study was performed aiming to evaluate the surgical efficacy, perioperative safety profile, diagnostic accuracy and medium term results of a multi-modal approach consisting in narrow band imaging (NBI) cystoscopy and bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) when compared to the standard protocol represented by white light cystoscopy (WLC) and transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT). A total of 260 patients with apparently at least one bladder tumor over 3 cm were included in the trial. In the first group, 130 patients underwent conventional and NBI cystoscopy followed by BPV, while in a similar number of cases of the second arm, classical WLC and TURBT were applied. In all non-muscle invasive bladder tumors' (NMIBT) pathologically confirmed cases, standard monopolar Re-TUR was performed at 4-6 weeks after the initial intervention, followed by one year' BCG immunotherapy. The follow-up protocol included abdominal ultrasound, urinary cytology and WLC, performed every 3 months for a period of 2 years. The obturator nerve stimulation, bladder wall perforation, mean hemoglobin level drop, postoperative bleeding, catheterization period and hospital stay were significantly reduced for the plasma vaporization technique by comparison to conventional resection. Concerning tumoral detection, the present data confirmed the NBI superiority when compared to standard WLC regardless of tumor stage (95.3% vs. 65.1% for CIS, 93.3% vs. 82.2% for pTa, 97.4% vs. 94% for pT1, 95% vs. 84.2% overall). During standard Re-TUR the overall (6.3% versus 17.4%) and primary site (3.6% versus 12.8%) residual tumors' rates were significantly lower for the NBI-BPV group. The 1 (7.2% versus 18.3%) and 2 (11.5% versus 25.8%) years' recurrence rates were substantially lower for the combined approach. NBI cystoscopy significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, while bipolar technology showed a higher surgical efficiency, lower morbidity and faster postoperative recovery. The combined technique offered a reduced rate of residual tumors at Re-TUR, both globally as well as for orthotopic tumors. Substantially lower recurrence rates were found at 1 and 2 years among the NBI-BPV cases.

This article comments on epidemiology, diagnosis and general principles of surgical management in patients with secondary peritonitis. The demographic data, clinical findings and surgical outcome of 204 patients who had a confirmed generalized secondary peritonitis were analyzed retrospectively. Our approach was laparotomy, surgical control of contamination, antibiotic therapy and modern intensive care support. Acid peptic disease was the most common cause of perforation peritonitis 60 (29,41%), following by the perforated appendicitis 45 ( 22,06%). The faecal peritonitis and colon perforation were found in 42 patients (20,59%). The morbidity rate was 50%; 41 (40,2%) patients had more than one complication. The morbidity rate was significantly the highest in patients with colon perforation (n=38, 90%) (Hi-square=40,1; p&lt;0,001). The overall mortality rate in our study was 8,82%.

The meaning of the posture in ergonomics is the manner in which different parts of the body are located and thus the reports are established between them in order to allow a special task execution. This article discusses the posture adopted by dentists when they work, beginning with the balanced posture and going to different variants of posture. The ideal posture of a dentist gives him, on the one hand the optimal working conditions (access, visibility and control in the mouth) and on the other hand, physical and psychological comfort throughout the execution of the clinical acts. Although the theme of dentist posture is treated with great care and often presented in the undergraduate courses and the continuing education courses on ergonomics in dentistry, many dentists do not know the subject well enough nor the theoretical issues and therefore nor the practical applicability.

The aims of the study were to find out if the prevalence of tumors is actually increased in MID-patients and which of the malignomas or benign tumors are the most frequent. The charts of MID-patients were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of malign or benign tumors. MID was diagnosed according to the modified Walker-criteria. Among the 475 MID-patients screened for tumors, at least a single malignoma was found in 65 patients (13.7%), and at least a single benign tumor in 35 patients (7.4%). Among those with malignancy, 22 were men and 43 women. Among those with a malignancy, 1 had definite MID, 9 probable MID, and 55 possible MID. The most common of the malignancies was breast cancer, followed by dermatological, gynecological, and gastrointestinal malignancies. The most frequent of the benign tumors was lipoma, followed by pituitary adenoma, meningeomas, carcinoids, and suprarenal adenomas. Compared to the general population, the prevalence of malignancies and of benign tumors was markedly increased. The female preponderance was explained by the frequent maternal inheritance of MIDs. Adult patients with a MID, particularly females, carry an increased risk to develop a malignancy or a benign tumor.

To evaluate the predictive value of POSSUM score in cirrhotic patients undergoing abdominal surgery in emergency cases. A prospective study based on 115 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis hospitalized and operated in the first 24 hours from admission for acute abdomen. The patients' stratification was done by using Child Pugh score for liver cirrhosis. POSSUM score was calculated for each patient and postoperative outcomes were compared with prediction based on this score. Statistical data analysis was made by using the chi-square test and a p value of less than 0,05 was considered to be statistically significant. There were 33 patients in stage Child A of cirrhosis, 54 in stage Child B and 28 in stage Child C. For Child A group, the POSSUM score had a satisfactory prediction in terms of morbidity and mortality. In advanced stages of liver cirrhosis, Child B and C, mortality had high rate and the observed outcomes were outside the area of POSSUM score prediction. POSSUM score offers a satisfactory prediction for morbidity and mortality in emergency abdominal surgery for patients in compensated stages of liver cirrhosis.

Patients were diagnosed by using immunopathology according to the WHO criteria. The analyzed group included 42 patients (both sexes), with the mean age of 60,35 years. The most frequent hematologic disease was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 30\/42 (71,42%), followed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (16,66%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (7,14%). Hepatitis viruses were distributed: 17\/42 (40,47%) patients with HBV, 22\/42 (52,38%) with HCV and 3\/42 (7,14%) had a double\/triple association of viruses. Most of the patients had an indolent type of disease - 27\/42 (64,28%), whereas 15\/42 (35,71%) had an aggressive one, pattern found both in the HBV and HCV infected groups. An abnormal bone marrow result was revealed in 32\/42 (76,19%) patients, 19 (59,37%) of them being HCV infected. Myelodysplasia was found in 6\/42(14,28%) patients, the majority being HCV infected, all having an indolent form of CLD. The antiviral therapy did not influence the hematological parameters (no significant differences were found between the groups with\/without an antiviral therapy). Patients with hepatitis virus infections may associate neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; the mechanisms are thought to involve hypersplenism, autoimmune processes and antiviral therapy. We excluded the influence of chemotherapy, as the study was performed before the treatment. In our group, patients whether HBV or HCV infected, presented an isolated cytopenia. The abnormal bone marrow cellularity (increased or decreased) and dysplasia were found especially in the HCV group. There are studies showing no association between myelodysplasia and hepatitis viruses; others found a strong relation of these. One of the mechanisms of myelodysplasia could be a dysregulation of the immune system. Conclusions. Bone marrow\/peripheral blood features correlate with the type of viral infection and HCV is more prone to develop additional hematological changes than HBV. The degree of bone marrow involvement by CLDs influences these features. We considered mandatory to perform a bone marrow analysis at the diagnosis of CLDs to stage and to establish if other bone marrow changes were present, a crucial aspect for therapy and outcome of the disease. The association between the hepatitis viruses - myelodysplasia- autoimmunity seems to have a role in the lymphoproliferative disorders etiology.

The attacks are initiated by non painful physical stimulation of specific areas (trigger points or zones) that are located ipsilateral to the pain. After each episode, there is usually a refractive period during which stimulation of the trigger zone will not induce the pain.

This anomaly is rarely reported in the medical literature, because of its low prevalence, and treatment usually yields unsatisfactory results. The most commonly used surgical interventions are: forearm repositioning osteotomies with derotation of the radius and ulna, segmental resections of the middle third of the radius with muscular interposition, resection of the synostosis with the interposition of fatty tissue, tendons or fascia lata and resection of the proximal radius along with the transfer of the distal extensor carpi ulnaris tendon on the lateral edge of the radius. To describe a new treatment method for PCRUS, which we based on a new pathogenic concept, and to present our preliminary results. Between 2011 and 2013 our team performed two myo-osteo-arthroplastic reconstructions of the elbow and forearm for PCRUS. The intervention involves the extraperiosteal stripping of the origins of the ventral forearm musculature, release of the interosseous membrane, resection of the proximal two thirds of the radius, reshaping of the synostosis, a double osteotomy of the ulna and the transfer and fixation of a proximal fibular graft, including the head with its articular cartilage, in place of the resected segment of the radius. Our preliminary study reveals favorable postoperative results, in comparison with other published methods. At the latest follow-up, one case had -10 degrees of pronation and 68 degrees of supination, and the other had 10 degrees of pronation and 66 degrees of supination. Compared with other techniques, myo-osteo-arthroplastic reconstruction may seem overly invasive. However, the extent of this intervention is mandated by the pathogenic concepts of helical distortion, muscular retraction and anomalous configuration of the interosseous membrane. Benign cases do not require surgery. When there is no helical distortion, the intervention may be limited to the transfer of the proximal extremity of the fibula for the infant and small child.

They are usually localized in the extremities with interest in the subcutaneous layer. The new imaging techniques play an important role in diagnosis, evaluation and follow-up of these types of tumors. We describe the case of a 21-year-old patient, four times operated for a recurrent soft tissue tumor, located intramuscularly in the distal third of the upper limb. Plain X-ray and computer tomography (CT) showed a nonspecific mass with calcification. The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) exam demonstrated a lobulated heterogeneous signal tumor mass in the biceps brachial muscles, with high signal intensity on T2 weighted images and intermediate signal on T1 weighted images. MRI accurately assessed the extent of the tumor and evaluated the recurrence. MRI imagings combined with contrast-enhanced sequences were used to classify the lesions in low flow vascular disorders. CT angiography with multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), maximum intensity projections (MIP) and volume-rendered reconstructions (VR) was useful in confirming the venous origin of the tumor.

Patients with HCV genotype 1 have a much less favorable response to therapy and are treated for 12 months, compared with patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3, in whom a 6-month course of therapy is sufficient. If viremia is present after 6 months, additional therapy has a negligible benefit, and treatment should be stopped in all patients regardless of the viral genotype. With HIV coinfection, all patients with a response to therapy at the end of 6 months should receive an additional 6 months of combination therapy regardless of the genotype. Patients with acute HCV infection should be treated for 6 months. The addition of protease inhibitors to the combination of PEG-IFN alfa and ribavirin is becoming the new standard of care for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. Regimens that include a protease inhibitor significantly improve sustained virologic response rates in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection.

To compare the methods used by our clinic and determine the outcomes in relation to healing, hospitalization time and recurrence. We have studied all the cases of patients with pilonidal sinus that were treated surgically in our clinic from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999. A total of 111 patients were treated of whom 92 (82,8%) were men and 19 (17,2%) were women. Ages ranged from 16 to 65 years with an average age of about 25,1 years. Of the 111 patients, 63 were treated with marsupializationand the remaining 48 were treated by excision (29 with open excision and 19 with the primary suture technique). One hundred and two (91,9%) patients were discharged from the hospital after the surgical procedure, while the remaining 9 patients were hospitalized for 24 hours. The healing time for marsupialization was 27,3 days, the primary suture technique was 11,7 days and the open excision method took 46,4 days. Recurrence was observed in 16 patients (14,4%). Recurrence appeared in 4 (6,35%) of the 63 patients subjected to marsupialization, 1 of the 29 patients subjected to open incision, and 11 (57,8%) of the 19 patients subjected to primary closure. In the absence of inflammation and\/or recurrence, marsupialization is the surgical method of choice as it has a low percentage of recurrence and an acceptably short healing period.In apparently large, inflamed and recurrent situations, open excision is preferred. ","974":"Although multimodal treatment has brought important benefit, there is still great heterogeneity regarding the indication and response to chemotherapy in Stage II and III, and individual variations related to both overall survival and toxicity of new therapies in metastatic disease or tumor relapse. Recent research in molecular biology led to the development of a large scale of genetic biomarkers, but their clinical use is not concordant with the high expectations. The Aim of this review is to identify and discuss the molecular markers with proven clinical applicability as prognostic and\/or predictive factors in CRC and also to establish a feasible algorithm of molecular testing, as routine practice, in the personalized, multidisciplinary approach of colorectal cancer patients in our country. Despite the revolution that occurred in the field of molecular marker research, only Serum CEA, Immunohistochemical analysis of mismatch repair proteins and PCR testing for KRAS and BRAF mutations have confirmed their clinical utility in the management of colorectal cancer. Their implementation in the current practice should partially resolve some of the controversies related to this heterogenic pathology, in matters of prognosis in different TNM stages, stage II patient risk stratification, diagnosis of hereditary CRC and likelihood of benefit from anti EGFR therapy in metastatic disease. The proposed algorithms of molecular testing are very useful but still imperfect and require further validation and constant optimization.","975":null,"976":"Before the discovery of Treponema pallidum as the etiologic agent, the origins of syphilis have been the subject of several debates.

The purpose of this article is to describe the different reconstruction techniques for anophthalmic sockets. In preparing the anopthalmic socket for prosthesis fitting we have several options: dermis-fat graft with a very good biocompatibility, the Guthoff artificial implant, which provides better motility or the methyl methacrylate implant inside the muscle cone.

Commonly described as a disease of childhood, adult celiac disease is a well known entity that should be taken into the differential diagnosis of a chronic diarrhea or of a malabsorption syndrome. The pathogenesis encompasses an autoimmune pathway that acts on a genetic background. The mucosa of the small intestine became damaged in reponse to foods that contain gluten in subjects with genetic susceptibility. The clinical presentation is variable, ranging from typical gastrointestinal symptoms to extradigestive and systemic manifestations. The simple withdrawal of the dietary gluten results in clinical improvement and healing of the intestinal mucosa.

In this regard we present a suggestive case. It is the case of a patient, aged 57, who came for treatment, suffering from subtotal maxillary and mandibular edentulism (present 11 and 21, respectively 33 and 43), previously having an overdenture prosthesis on natural teeth, with special systems - ball attachment type, dissatisfied with the treatment (due to repeated fractures and functional intolerance to dentures). Clinical examination revealed an increase of the vertical dimension of occlusion and reduced prosthetic space at a correct, functional DVO value, aspects that were explaining the patient's reported complaints. As a therapeutic approach, having into consideration the balance conditions that were favorable for complete dentures and the large ball attachments volume, which did not allow keeping them at a functional DVO at any of the jaws, and the relatively young age of the patient, it was decided to remove the ball attachments and to keep the teeth for a simple overdenture, both to the maxillar and the mandible, over coronary reduced teeth, enough to allow the denture thickness at a functional DVO.

To obtain good results, a thorough knowledge of local anatomy and a profound respect for hemostasis are necessary. Routine, at least visual, identification of the inferior laryngeal nerve (ILN) is considered gold standard and is strongly recommended. Surgeons are generally aware of the variations the nerve can have, especially on the right side. Although very rare, one such variation, with possible great impact on outcomes, is the non-recurrent route of the nerve. We present the case of a middle-aged woman with a multinodular goiter scheduled for elective surgery. During total thyroidectomy, on the right side, we were not able to find the inferior laryngeal nerve in its usual position, using the customary anatomical landmarks. Instead, we encountered it emerging directly from the right vagus nerve, at a rather right angle and entering the larynx as a unique non-bifurcating nerve. Thus, it could be spared from any injury and protected, although it could have been easily confounded with a vascular structure, given its transverse course.We think it is never overmuch to repeat that the routine identification and exposure of the inferior laryngeal nerve is a must for the thyroid surgeon in order to safely preserve its integrity.

This is a retrospective study which included 100 patients consecutively admitted in a Nephrology Department with crescentic pauci-immune glomerulonephritis diagnosed by kidney biopsy. ANCAs were assessed by capture ELISA or indirect immunofluorescence (IFI). Patients were followed for a median period of 3.2 [0.1; 5.5] years. The median age was 61.6 years. The clinical condition at presentation was severe (median BVAS 16 and BVAS over 21 in one quarter of patients), mostly because of general, kidney and lung scores. Median creatinine was 5.7 mg\/dL and 17% of the patients needed temporary dialysis. Eight patients relapsed (13.8%): one in the lung and seven in the kidney. The median time to relapse was 11.3 [9.2; 19.9] months. None of the investigated parameters allowed for differentiating patients who relapsed from those who did not, except higher hematuria in those who relapsed.

The most frequent causes are those associated with retinal hypoxia, which promotes the upregulation of the VEGF synthesis and produces fibrovascular membranes over the anterior chamber angle. Because the administration of anti VEGF products is still off label for neovascular glaucoma, there is not a single accepted way of treatment. There are differences between the site of administration (vitreal or anterior chamber or both at the same time), the dose or the setting of the procedure. Objective. The objective of our study was to asses the difference of efficacy and complications of bevacizumab injection for vitreal administration versus anterior chamber administration. Methods and results. Prospective study with 18 eyes from 18 patients with neovascular glaucoma associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. Group A (10 patients) received intravitreal injection with 0.05 ml Bevacizumab. Group B (8 patients) received anterior chamber injection with 0.03 ml Bevacizumab. There was a significant decrease of intraocular pressure (p&lt;0.01 for group A, p&lt;0.05 for group B) for both groups. Group A also had a statistically significant decrease of the macular edema (p&lt;0.05). The side effects were reduced for both groups. Discussion. Our conclusion was that for the neovascular glaucoma, which associates significant macular edema, the intravitreal procedure should be performed, while for neovascular glaucoma patients without retinal edema, the anterior chamber procedure should be preferred because of reduced potential side effects.

All the cells in the retina are affected by the diabetic milieu, and in view of such disease and tissue complexity, it is unlikely that any single process is solely responsible for the retinal pathophysiology. Dyslipidemia is considered a trigger to rapid worsening of the condition and its treatment is becoming a part of normal diabetes treatment.

Fractures of the orbital region have an incidence of 10-25% from total facial fractures and the most common age group was the third decade of life. The majority of cases require reconstruction of the orbital floor to support the globe position and restore the shape of the orbit. The reason for this is that the bony walls are comminuted and\/or bone fragments are missing. Therefore, the reconstruction of missing bone is important rather than reducing bone fragments. This can be accomplished using various materials. There is hardly any anatomic region in the human body that is so controversial in terms of appropriate material used for fracture repair: nonresorbable versus resorbable, autogenous\/allogenous\/xenogenous versus alloplastic material, non-prebent versus preformed (anatomical) plates, standard versus custom-made plates, nonporous versus porous material, non-coated versus coated plates.

Retrospectively analyzed data from 18 patients admitted with ethylene glycol poisoning in the emergency department between 2011 and 2012. The following were taken into consideration: incidence of intoxication in the group study, medical history, the amount ingested and the time since the ingestion of ethylene glycol and the admission to hospital, presence of metabolic acidosis and laboratory test results on admission (urea, creatinine osmolar or anion gaps), the treatment initiated and the outcome of the patient. 18 patients with ethylene glycol intoxication were admitted to hospital between 2011 and 2012. The initial diagnosis based on a detailed clinical history in combination with the presence of metabolic acidosis with elevation of the osmolar or anion gaps. 12 of the 18 patients were man (66%) and age range interval was between 23 and 77 years. The time from the ingestion of ethylene glycol and the admission to hospital was between 30 minutes and older than 24 hours. 14 patients have been presented earlier to the hospital, between 30 minutes and 12 hours (in the first part of the clinical stage) and 13 of the 14 patients had a favorable evolution. One of these patients had an unfavorable evolution. Regarding this patient, the amount ingested was unknown. 10 of the 18 patients had a voluntary ingestion (55,55%) and 6 of the 18 patients had an alcoholism medical history. The amount ingested by the patients was between 20 ml and 500 ml. Metabolic acidosis was present up to 55,55% (10 of the 18 patients) in the blood gas analysis on admission, with pH on admission between 6.9 and 7.27, with anion gap ranging between 16.3 mmol\/l and 32.6 mmol\/l (normal range 8-16 mmol\/l). Ten patients also had an increased level of urea and creatinine with a level between 1.24 to 6.85 mg\/dl for creatinine (normal range 0.5-1.2 mg\/dl) and 49 to 98 mg\/dl for urea (normal range 15-43 mg\/dl) and developed acute kidney injury that required regular HD sessions. Mechanical ventilation was required for 7 of the 18 patients (38.88%). Five patients died (27.77%). Although metabolic acidosis was corrected under hemodialysis, there were patients who had multiple organ failure and systems: acute respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, acute renal failure requiring dialysis daily sessions, altered state of consciousness. The early diagnostic and exclusion of the other diseases and other poisoning led to a specific treatment of the intoxication. The time from the ingestion of ethylene glycol and the early establishment of therapy is very important for a favorable evolution and can prevent substantial mortality. ","1009":"The cytological interpretation of ASC-US represents a category of morphologic uncertainty. For patients with this result, other tests are necessary in order to determine the risk for cervical lesions. 198 patients with ASC-US cytology have been analyzed between 2008 and 2013. All the patients included in the study have subsequently had a high oncogenic HPV testing and colposcopy risk. 103 (52%) patients tested positive for high risk HPV and 21 (10%) had associated colposcopy changes and precancerous and cancerous lesions identified through biopsy. 95 (48%) patients tested negative for HPV and none of these women had lesions at colposcopy. High oncogenic risk HPV testing was proven useful in identifying the patients with ASC-US cytology who are at high risk for cervical lesions (100% sensibility). In this study, the HPV testing had a negative predictive value of 100%, which uselessly renders a further colposcopy evaluation. HPV testing for women with ASC-US is not specific in identifying women with cervical lesions (Specificity 53%) and this results from a high prevalence of limited HPV infections in an age group which is less than 30 years old. High risk HPV testing for women with ASC-US cervical cytology is useful in determining the risk for precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. A positive result is associated with a high risk for cervical lesions (20%) and for these patients colposcopy is necessary. For women with a negative result, the risk for cervical lesions is practically null so colposcopy is not required. ","1010":"Bell's palsy in known as the most common cause of facial paralysis, determined by the acute onset of lower motor neuron weakness of the facial nerve with no detectable cause. With a lifetime risk of 1 in 60 and an annual incidence of 11-40\/100,000 population, the condition resolves completely in around 71% of the untreated cases. Clinical trials performed for Bell's palsy have reported some recurrences, ipsilateral or contralateral to the side affected in the primary episode of facial palsy. Only few data are found in the literature. Melkersson-Rosenthal is a rare neuromucocutaneous syndrome characterized by recurrent facial paralysis, fissured tongue (lingua plicata), orofacial edema. We attempted to analyze some clinical and epidemiologic aspects of recurrent idiopathic palsy, and to develop relevant correlations between the existing data in literature and those obtained in this study. This is a retrospective study carried out on a 10-years period for adults and a five-year period for children. A number of 185 patients aged between 4 and 70 years old were analyzed. 136 of them were adults and 49 were children. 22 of 185 patients with Bell's palsy (12%) had a recurrent partial or complete facial paralysis with one to six episodes of palsy. From this group of 22 cases, 5 patients were diagnosed with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The patients' age was between 4 and 70 years old, with a medium age of 27,6 years. In the group studied, fifteen patients, meaning 68%, were women and seven were men. The majority of patients in our group with more than two facial palsy episodes had at least one episode on the contralateral side. Our study found a significant incidence of recurrences of idiopathic facial palsy. Recurrent idiopathic facial palsy and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is diagnosed more often in young females. Recurrence is more likely to occur in the first two years from the onset, which leads to the conclusion that we should have a follow up of patients diagnosed with Bell's palsy for at least two years from the onset, especially in children' case. The frequency of recurrent facial palsy in children was similar to that in adults. Recurrent idiopathic facial palsy is not known enough and needs further controlled studies. ","1011":"The only known precursor of the esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is represented by the Barrett's esophagus (BE). EAC incidence has increased sharply in the last 4 decades. The annual conversion rate of BE to cancer is small but significant; therefore the identification of patients at a higher risk of cancer represents a dilemma. The endoscopic surveillance of BE aims to detect dysplasia and in particular high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancers that can be endoscopically treated before progressing to invasive cancer with lymph node metastases. Using standard white light endoscopy (WLE), these high-risk lesions are often subtle and hard to detect. In addition to high-definition standard endoscopy, chromoendoscopy (CE), virtual chromoendoscopy (e.g. narrow band imaging), and confocal laser endomicroscopy might increase the diagnostic efficiency for the detection of dysplastic lesions and can also increase the diagnostic efficiency for the detection of BE dysplasia or cancer. This ability to detect subtle mucosal abnormalities that harbor high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal carcinoma might enable endoscopists skilled in the assessment of BE to perform targeted rather than random biopsies. The standard protocol will remain the careful examination by using conventional high-resolution endoscopes, combined with a longer inspection time, which is associated with an increased detection of dysplasia until these modalities have been demonstrated to enhance efficiency or be cost effective. Many of the limitations of the current clinical standard may be overcome in the future by the use of multi-modal imaging combined with molecular information.

","1014":"The most important known metabolic complication of the newborns from diabetic mothers, including diabetes type 1 and 2 and gestational diabetes, is the postnatal hypoglycemia. If unrecognized and undiagnosed, hypoglycemia in this particular high-risk group can determine severe neurological lesions and even death, in a significantly higher proportion than those from the general population. The present paper brings arguments for the crucial importance of screening for post-natal hypoglycemia in the early hours after birth, and discusses the management strategies and the topics that still remain in debate. ","1015":"Almost 200 molecular markers in oncology, very important in the diagnosis, prognostic and treatment were identified. The cell and tissue markers and also the circulating (sanguine) ones are genetic markers of the hereditary and non-hereditary tumors. Also extremely important are the regulatory ways of cell growth and differentiation, of the cell \"senescence\" and cell death (apoptosis). The term of \"tumor marker\" concerns a variety of molecules or processes that are different in the normal cell compared with the malign cell. The tumor markers may include modifications to the genetic level (mutations, deletions or genes amplifications) to the transcription level (super expression or sub-expression), to the translation level (high or low quantities of proteins, abnormal glycosylation of proteins) and\/or to the functional level (the level of cell differentiation or presence of neo-vascularisation). Cancer is a genetic disease. There is a deregulation at the genes level that controls the cell division and withdrawal from the cell cycle or there is a genetic susceptibility. In other words, cancer is an end point for several phases in which the oncogenes and stimulatory signals and inhibitors produced and controlled by the products of these oncogenes are involved. ","1016":"Cirrhosis is a pathological entity characterized by the association of hepatocyte necrosis, fibrosis and regenerative nodules; hemodynamic and neurohormonal metabolic factors intervening in its development mechanisms, resulting in hepatic stellate cell activation and transformation and development of liver fibrosis. Cytokines are key modulators of liver cell fibroblast transformation. Prostaglandins play an important role in the control of vascular tone and in thrombosis; Angiotensin II stimulates fibroblast proliferation by AT-1 receptors. Thrombin influences cellular remodeling in the liver and cardiovascular cirrhotic patients. Oxidative stress is involved in the development of liver cirrhosis by primary and secondary biological irreversible effects. Complex etiology involving vasoactive substances, oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis, require further studies to elucidate the mechanisms involved in hemodynamic disturbances associated with this disorder. ","1017":"Cervical screening by using cytology was proven efficient in reducing the mortality secondary to cervical cancer, but this method has limitations. High risk HPV infection is essential for cervical cancer development so HPV testing is a new tool used for screening patients for cervical neoplasia. HPV testing was proven most useful for women over 30 years old, in cases in which cytology identified ASC-US and after treatment for CIN. This article outlines the clinical significance of HPV-DNA testing for precancerous cervical lesions and the evidence that stands behind these recommendations.","1018":"Acute pancreatitis is a serious disease. Triggered by the local inflammation of the pancreas, it can cause inflammation in various organs and systems in the body. It is important to identify severe forms of acute pancreatitis with an increased morbidity and mortality rate. Lately, internationally, numerous clinical and paraclinical factors predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis have been proposed. The purpose of the study is to identify the prognostic intraoperative factors of severity. The prospective study was conducted over a period of four years, between 2007 and 2010 and included 238 patients treated in a surgical clinic in Bucharest. 103 patients experienced a severe form of acute pancreatitis, which means 67.95% of all operations practiced. We monitored intraoperative factors, in particular: the presence and\/ or the extent of pancreatic necrosis, common bile duct lithiasis and intraperitoneal fluid, parameters proposed to become statistically prognostic factors in the development and long-term morbidity of acute pancreatitis. The presence and\/ or extension of necrosis was identified in the histopathology only in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. 71.43% of the patients with common bile duct lithiasis and 73.91% of the patients with inflammatory intraperitoneal fluid had severe acute pancreatitis. Most patients who developed postoperative complications (86.49%) or who required a surgical intervention (85.71%), presented a severe form of the disease. pancreatic necrosis, common bile duct lithiasis and intraperitoneal fluid may contribute to a more precise prediction of severity, as confirmed by international literature. ","1019":"The injury of the esophageal epithelium may be determined by the reflux of the gastric acid in the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is characterized by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium with the columnar epithelium, when the healing of the lesion occurs. According to some studies, the incidence of the esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with BE is of about 0,5% per year. The term Barrett's esophagus is subjected to interpretation nowadays, so it lacks the clarity needed for the clinical and scientific communication on the subject of columnar metaplasia of the esophageal mucosa. The major pathogenetic factor in the development of BE is represented by the reflux disease. The cellular origin of BE is controversial and it represents an issue that needs to be resolved because it will have implications in the putative molecular mechanisms underlying the metaplastic process. The epigenetic or genetic changes, which alter protein expression, function, and\/ or activity, in post-mitotic cells to drive transdifferentiation or in stem\/ progenitor cells such that they are reprogrammed to differentiate into columnar rather than squamous cells, are driven by the inflammatory environment created by chronic reflux. In order to be able to develop better therapeutic strategies for the patients with this disease, an increasing interest in understanding the pathogenesis of BE at the cellular and molecular level presents these days. ","1020":"During the transition period, the Romanian medical system, subject (like other areas) to a process of reform, had to go through a difficult path, not without obstacles (malpractice, underfunding, embezzlement scandals in the media etc.). Consequently, Romania has faced (and unfortunately still is still facing) the massive exodus of health professionals to countries where they can benefit from better working conditions and payment, and those who suffer from health care crisis are the patients. Reform means \"the people in the system for the people\", which requires a change of mindset within the medical staff, especially in the continuous professional development. However, to talk about the quality of the medical act requires that all those involved in the medical system should create appropriate conditions - i.e. advanced technical equipment and appropriate salaries. In addition, as underfunding is the main cause of failure in the health system, that management remains the only tool that can lead to the appropriate use of the existing resources and the quality of health services. Therefore, the idea of public-private partnership - which occurred as a challenge, especially after the EU accession - can be considered a solution designed to improve the quality and cost of health services. In other words, the cooperation of the private sector with the public authority means increasing the rigor of the medical equipment performance, fostering professional competition, and an increased attention to the patient, in a word: performance. Currently, more and more frequently, the management has studied to identify opportunities for innovation in health care services in an attempt to bring together patients and practitioners in the field by resorting to the identification of the ways they can receive health care services promptly, fairly and efficiently. Therefore, a clear and responsible design in the spirit of ethics and medical ethic will help the marketing manager solve many of the complex issues raised by the marketing activity in the field of health care. ","1021":"HYPOTHESIS AND AIM: The large number of invalidating surgical interventions in patients suffering from lesions of the diabetic foot, the late recognition of the lesions and sometimes the wrongful interpretation of their severity, have made necessary a multi-parameter study of these types of patients and the elaboration of a therapeutic-prognostic index to guide the physician in adopting the adequate method of treatment. Starting with the therapeutic-prognostic index imagined by professor Traian Patrascu, we have elaborated a new therapeutic prognostic index, by adding new, statistically significant parameters, for the purpose of facilitating the surgical indication, depending on the lesion type. A number of 929 patients who were admitted at the Surgery Clinic of the \"Dr. I. Cantacuzino\" Hospital, between January 2013 and June 2014, have been analyzed, of whom 450 were evaluated retrospectively and 479 prospectively. The new therapeutic prognostic index has been calculated for the retrospective lot, resulting into a concordance between the actual surgical intervention and the prognostic index of 79.4% and, for the patients evaluated prospectively, we have found a confirmation of the relation of 82.6% between the performed surgical intervention and the forecasted surgical intervention, by calculating the index. The new therapeutic-prognostic index represents an easy method of establishing the therapeutic conduct of the patient suffering from lesions of the diabetic foot. It is of major use in preventing the execution of such surgical interventions that may be disproportionate compared to the severity of the lesions, especially in facilities where the pathology of the diabetic foot is less known. ","1022":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is a pathological entity mainly associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). The clinical syndrome is characterized by various degrees of intestinal obstruction due to thickening, sclerosis and calcification of peritoneum resulting in the encapsulation and cocooning of the bowel. It is a rare but potentially devastating complication associated with a considerable morbidity and mortality. Cases of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), diagnosed in the Surgical Clinic of \"Cantacuzino\" Hospital, between 2007 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. During this interval, 432 surgical interventions related to peritoneal dialysis were performed: 306 peritoneal access interventions and 124 complications, of which 15 patients with EPS. In all but two cases, the EPS diagnostic was established at the time of the surgical intervention addressed to other complication or pathology. Moreover, in 2 of the 15 patients the diagnostic was established approximately 5 months after PD was discontinued, and, in one of these patients at the time of the extraction of the dialysis catheter. 12 of 15 patients were diabetic. Most patients had a history of multiple peritonitis episodes. All the patients required the passing from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. There were 4 deaths (26,6%) of which one was around two months from the diagnosis. The timely diagnosis of the condition and the appropriate phase-specific treatment is of utmost importance in EPS. In advanced stages, the surgical intervention performed by a well-trained team could achieve good long-term results.

They enable the clinician to predict the outcome, stratify risk, assess conditions and diagnose diseases accurately. In the emergency medicine, it is very important to ascertain safety criteria to discharge patients, time to remain in the E.R., and also ascertain the time intervals for discharge\/admission. The use of the scores in the emergency medicine, toxicology and other areas of intensive medicine have become increasingly efficient. Creating a prognostic score for the acute intoxications to be used by the personnel from the Emergency Departments may have positive effects in the management of the poisoned patients (e.g. the admission in a certain treatment space: cases expected to have a trend towards worsening will be directed to the resuscitation space and after a short period of time admitted in the appropriate facility; this way, the bed occupancy time in the Emergency Department will be shortened).

They were not diagnosed with carcinoid syndrome, or bone anomalies, and received no treatment (including antiresorptives). The following bone formation markers were performed: serum alkaline phosphatase (AP), serum osteocalcin (OC), and the bone resorption marker: serum CrossLaps (CL). Serum serotonin (high-pressure liquid chromatography), as well as central DXA (GE Prodigy) were assessed. 191 women of 57.1 years mean age were grouped according to DXA (WHO criteria). The linear regression analysis between serum serotonin and CL were not statistically significant (SS), between serotonin and OC was SS in the newly diagnosed osteoporosis group (N=40, r=0.4, p=0.03), between serotonin and AP SS was found in osteopenia group (N=88, r=0.24, p=0.03), with no changes when adjusting for age and BMI. The partial correlation between serotonin and BMD was not SS. The study raises the question of serotonin as a bone metabolism marker seeing that the results were not consistent.

Among the 26 clinical L. monocytogenes isolates tested, no multidrug resistant strains were detected, but 18 (72%) were found to be resistant to at least one clinically relevant antibiotic. Among them, 18 clinical isolates were resistant against ciprofloxacin also. Resistance to Ciprofloxacin was particularly noticed to the strains in Romania. Serological and molecular typing by Multiplex PCR method detected two molecular types 1\/2 a, 3a and 1\/2 b, 3b, as to the more frequent isolated among studied cases.

","1038":"Innate immune system is a universal form of host defense against infections. The recognition of the innate immunity is based on a limited number of encoded receptors that have evolved to recognize microbial metabolism products. The recognition of these molecular structures allows the immune system to distinguish its own infectious components from non-communicable structures. The immune suppression is a hallmark of sepsis. The complement system is activated in the early stages of sepsis, generating large amounts of anaphylatoxin C5a. Complement and TLRs (toll-like receptors) family are two major upstream sensors and effectors systems of innate immunity. It was found that TLR4 and complement system are involved in the initiation of the inflammatory response in sepsis. Clinical studies in which TLR4 was blocked have not shown beneficial effects. TLRs, that are a subfamily of PRRs (pattern recognition receptors), have emerged as the crucial receptors for the recognition of DAMPs (Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules). Recently, a special form of non-coding genetic material called microRNA has been highlighted in the complex cascade of sepsis. The individual role of every microRNA and the exact role of microRNA network are under investigation. Currently, studies are performed in order to find micro RNA to be used as biomarkers of sepsis. Researches are performed to determine microRNA, small fragments of non-coding RNA, in order to distinguish between patients with sepsis and healthy patients, and if the plasma levels of microRNA correlate with the severity of the disease. Recent researches report that the regulation of gene expression through microRNA plays a very important role in the following cellular processes, for example: apoptosis, the differentiation process, and the cell cycle.

Therefore, the main objective of periodontal therapy is to eliminate the microbial biofilm along with the calculus deposits from the root surface by root surface debridement. Over the past years, a large number of clinical and laboratory studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of calculus removal by various methods. None of these conventional methods or devices was effective in completely eliminating all the calculus from the diseased root surfaces. In this context, a number of newer technologies have been developed to identify and selectively remove the dental calculus. Regarding this fact, the present article highlights a critical review of these devices based on published clinical and experimental data.

Evaluation of efficacy and safety of AC paracentesis in acute increases of intraocular pressure. This was an observational study done on a group of 24 patients with acute, unilateral increases of IOP&gt; 50mmHg. IOP was measured before, 10 minutes, 1 day, 7 days and 30 days after ACP using applanation tonometry. Intraocular pressure decreased from an average of 52.5 mmHg to 25.5 mmHg to 17.5 mmHg at 10 minutes and 7 days from the ACP. Anterior chamber paracentesis combined with glaucoma medication led to the cessation of symptoms in all patients included in the lot and the resolution of corneal edema in 20 cases. ACP is safe and effective in acute increases of IOP in the acute form of the primary angle closure glaucoma but remains an adjunct to conventional therapy drug.

The clinical importance of VEP is to diagnose the functional changes of the optic nerve in different diseases such as diabetic mellitus. Our study sought latency of VEP changes depending on glycemic value and duration of diabetes in Wistar rats. this study evaluated the VEP of 25 rats in three groups: control group, diabetic group 1 with glycemic values between 200-400mg\/dl and diabetic group 2 with glycemic values between 400 and 600mg\/dl. These rats from diabetic group 2 were followed for 4 months and the ones in control group and diabetic group 1 for 5 months. the latency of VEP shows slight changes without any statistical significance in the control group. In diabetic group 1 and 2 similar changes occurred, with statistical significance and the amplitude of the changes was proportional with the glycemic value. The rats had a rapid increase of VEP latency after the induction of diabetes and returned to a normal range in the first month. After a time, when the latencies of VEP were in normal range, a new growth appeared faster and larger as the glycemic values were higher. diabetes brings changes to the visual signal transmission and to the central processing, this being revealed by the examination of the visually evoked potential. Increased VEP latency is statistically correlated with the changes that occur at the level of the values of glucose in blood. A rapid growth in blood sugar lowers the visual signal transmission. This change is temporary despite the persistence of elevated blood glucose values, probably by adjusting to the new condition. However, maintaining high glycemic values remotely produces a progressive increase of the delay of the visual signal. This progressive increase is faster as blood glucose levels are higher. ","1049":"Antithyroid drugs as thionamides are largely used in the treatment of the thyrotoxicosis. Side effects were reported in less than 10% of the cases, especially hematological, hepatic or skin allergies. One of the most severe manifestations is agranulocytosis, probably based on an immune mechanism that is exacerbated by the presence of the thyroid autoimmune disease itself. If the presence of the severe leucopenia is actually an epiphenomenon of a preexisting hematological disturbance as multiple myeloma is debated. The myeloma may also be correlated with an autoimmune predisposition. We present the case of a 56 years old female patient diagnosed with Graves' disease, who developed agranulocytosis after 8 months of therapy with thiamazole. Two months after antithyroid drug's withdrawal, the granulocytes number increased and she received therapy with radioiodine. Two years later she came back for diffuse bone pain that turned out to be caused by a multiple myeloma, confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.

The attitude upon the repair of these hernias varies from expectancy or elective treatment in early stages of the disease to the surgical treatment only if complications occur. We have assessed 22 consecutive cases of cirrhosis patients treated for complicated umbilical hernia in the Surgical Department of \"Sf. Pantelimon\" Emergency Hospital in Bucharest between January 2008 and December 2012. The patients' stratification was done in stages of liver disease based upon Child-Pugh classification. Complications that required emergency repair were the following: strangulation, incarceration and hernia rupture. The postoperative complications were ordered in five grades of severity based upon Clavien classification. The severity of the complications was higher in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis, Child B and C. There were 5 deaths representing 22,7%, four of them in patients with Child C disease stage. The incidence of morbidity and mortality after umbilical hernia repair in emergencies increases in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis. It is advisable to prevent complications occurrence and perform surgical repair of umbilical hernia in elective condition. ","1052":"Respiratory diseases are responsible for a significant number of deaths and considerable suffering in humans. Accumulating evidence suggests that oral disorders, particularly periodontal disease, may influence the course of respiratory infections like bacterial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral periodontopathic bacteria can be aspirated into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia. The teeth may also serve as a reservoir for respiratory pathogen colonization and subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. The overreaction of the inflammatory process that leads to the destruction of the connective tissue is present in both periodontal disease and emphysema. This overreaction may explain the association between periodontal disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mechanisms of infection could be the aspiration into the lung of oral pathogens capable of causing pneumonia, colonization of dental plaque by respiratory pathogens followed by aspiration, or facilitation of colonization of the upper airway by pulmonary pathogens by periodontal pathogens.

However, the combination between the anterior hip dislocation and the ipsilateral intertrochanteric fracture is extremely rare, the literature offering only scarce information. We present the case of a patient, aged 44, victim of a trauma by precipitation from height (12m), diagnosed with left hip anterior dislocation and intertrochanteric fracture of the ipsilateral femur. An emergency surgical treatment was applied in less than 3 hours after trauma. The hip dislocation was reduced under general anesthesia and the intertrochanteric fracture was also reduced and internally fixed with a dynamic hip screw. Radiological and functional evaluation at 6 months after surgery, using the modified Merle D'Aubigne hip score was good. The clinical outcome of such a case depends on the quick evaluation and treatment. Providing a stable reduction of the dislocation and a stable internal fixation of the fracture as soon as possible (within the first 6 hours) will allow an early physical rehabilitation and decrease the risk of complications.

Therefore, this risk must be carefully considered and it determines the endorsement of perioperative measures with important medical implications. Perioperative cardiac risk evaluation guidelines were published since 2010 and they represent a highly important assessmnet tool. Emergency surgery requires an adaptation of the guidelines to the actual medical situations in extreme conditions. METHODS, RESULTS, DISCUSSION: Analyzing the way the perioperative evaluation itself is conducted is an extremely important tool. Quantifying the clinical application of the guidelines, one can monitor real parameters and find solutions for improving medical care. The current study was conducted on a representative sample of 8326 patients, respecting the recommendation strategies for calculating the surgical risk adapted for the emergency surgery setting. The dominant conclusion is the need to develop a standardized form, summarized for quick and objective assessment of perioperative cardiac risk score. Only a complex medical team could calculate this score while the decisional team leader for the surgical patient remains the surgeon.

After 9 days from the onset of the disease, the patient developed acute necrotizing pancreatitis, infected from the very beginning, associated with multiple organ failure, septic shock and severe anemia. The diagnosis was clinically and biologically stated and confirmed by CT-scan. The patient underwent surgery for infected necrotizing acute pancreatitis of the head and neck of the pancreas, with left retroperitoneal expansion down to the left iliac fossa. We performed a necrosectomy with the evacuation of the tisular debris, multiple drainage of the peritoneal cavity, followed by an open abdomen with synthetic mesh.

Department of Surgery, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector-32, Chandigarh, India, from August 2006 to October 2008. The choice of procedure depends on the patient's symptoms, the extent of the hemorrhoidal disease, and the experience of the surgeon along with the availability of the techniques\/instruments. This is a prospective study done from August 2006 to October 2008. Total number of 155 patients was included in the study. Infrared Coagulation Therapy (IRC) was performed through a special designed proctoscope. Patients excluded were with coagulopathy disorders, fissure in ano, and anal ulcers. Results - It is an outpatient Department (OPD), non-surgical, ambulatory, painless and bloodless procedure, without any hospital stay. Early recovery and minimal recurrence of hemorrhoids were noted without any morbidity or mortality. We have studied 155 patients, treated with IRC on OPD basis. Surgery was required in few patients in whom IRC failed or was contraindicated. Out of the total 155 patients, 127 came for follow up. After the 1st sitting of IRC therapy: out of 127; 43 patients got a total relief, mass shrinkage was of &gt; 75% in 57 cases and &lt; 50% in 14 cases. Twenty-eight cases did not come for follow-up. In the 2nd sitting, out of 84\/127; 58 patients got a total relief, &gt;75% relief in 15 cases and &gt;50 % relief in 11 patients. In the 3rd sitting out of 26\/84 cases: 13 cases got a total relief and 13 cases refused to take the third sitting; however, in 7 cases the hemorrhoidal mass shrank up to 50% after the two sittings. These 14 were operated as there was no relief from bleeding after giving two sittings of IRC. Our opinion is that, in the above 14 cases, the patient might have not followed the instructions properly for dietary habits. IRC is a safe, simple and effective procedure for early hemorrhoids without any complications. IRC is nowadays the world's leading office treatment for hemorrhoids. IRC is a better option than the surgical treatment as it is easy, well tolerated, and remarkably complication-free. In our study, we have not used any course of antibiotics. In the management of early hemorrhoids, IRC should be considered as a simple trouble-free and painless option.

In most patients, the source of bleeding is easily identified during conventional upper and\/or lower gastrointestinal endoscopies. A significant progress in the evaluation of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding was brought by the advent of capsule endoscopy. Since colonoscopy is not always technically feasible, colon VCE might be useful where the conventional procedure poses substantial risks to patients or it is refused by them. We present the case of a 58-year-old patient, with severe anemia caused by bleeding from a gastrointestinal source. The patient was diabetic, hypertensive and with impaired heart function, aggravated by anemia.

More over, the previously attempted and analyzed therapeutic modalities failed to achieve acknowledgement as standard treatment for this particular pathology. The bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) was introduced as a viable mean of removing the obstructing scar formation in a gradual fashion. Several \"tips and tricks\" were described as particularly useful in optimizing the plasma corona vaporization effect. The proper BPV technique is simple and safe while closely relying on certain surgical steps, the simultaneous vaporization and coagulation processes and a superior endoscopic vision. Recent technological advances created the premises for further improvements. The plasma-button vaporization is characterized by a satisfactory surgical speed, remote intraoperative bleeding risks, high-quality endoscopic visibility as well as the achievement of a complete sclerotic tissue removal. Within a short learning curve, a superior final aspect of the prostatic fossa and bladder neck is obtained at the end of surgery. The continuous plasma vaporization mode provides additional technical advantages. The previously described drawbacks of transurethral incision or resection seem to have been overcome by the practical features of the plasma vaporization process. The BPV technique outlines a promising modality of efficiently ablating the obstructing fibrous tissue in secondary BNS patients.

The aim of this paper is to present three new electrophoretic methods using Hyrys-Hydrasys SEBIA system that have been used for the first time in Electrophoresis Laboratory of our hospital in the analysis of joint fluid for the prevention of periprosthetic osteolysis in revision arthroplasty. Analytical aspects of agarose gel electrophoresis of joint fluid proteins and lipoproteins as well as SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis of joint fluid proteins, their performances and clinical value are presented. The decreased level of albumin and increased level of alpha1 and alpha2 globulins were frequent changes detected on SEBIA electropherograms and good indicator for the presence of an inflammatory reaction generated by particle debris. In addition, a slightly increase of LDL mobility could provide good information about a high oxidative stress. Moreover, the Ig G assessed by using SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis could be a potential biomarker for an immunological reaction towards orthopedic implants. Electrophoresis of joint fluid using Hyrys-Hydrasys SEBIA France system is a new analytical technique able to remove the most of current biomarkers disadvantages due to the determination of particular proteins (acute phase proteins, albumin, lipoproteins, and immunoglobulins) by using minimal amounts of joint fluid with minor interferences, minimal cost and rapid results.

All the social, psychological and physical disadvantages must be removed or at least mitigated, all within the society's limited resources. In Romania, this situation has led in the last couple of years to the selection of a number of extremely severe cases, which could not be solved by orthopedic and classic surgical treatment methods. These patients exhibit gracile long bones, which are distorted, often with cystic degeneration at the level of the extremities, pseudarthroses, limb length discrepancies, most of them being unable to walk, being condemned to sitting in a wheelchair. This paper deals with the experience of the Orthopedics Department of \"Maria Sklodowska Curie\" Clinical Emergency Hospital for Children, in Bucharest, in the field of surgical treatment for moderate and severe forms of OI, within the time frame of May 2002-May 2012. For the first time in Romania, on May 20, 2002, the team led by Professor Gh. Burnei, MD, has implanted telescopic rods in the femur and tibia of a patient with OI. One of the most important themes, of great interest in the orthopedic surgery, is the osteoarticular regularization and reconstruction in severe forms of OI, which should allow the patients to stand and walk. These cases are a challenge for the surgeon, who is in the position of applying new, complex procedures, or perfecting, modifying and adapting techniques that have already been established. The aim of the surgical treatment is the increase of the quality of life of these children and adolescents and of their social integration. In the above-mentioned period, from the OI patients who are in the evidence of our clinic, 32 were operated on, totaling 81 surgeries. Out of these, 28 patients, aged 2-27 years, have benefited from reconstructive surgery of the pelvic limbs. Sofield-Millar osteotomies were practiced and 69 Sheffield telescopic rods were implanted in 25 patients and 43 surgeries. The coxa vara \/ valga correction using the Sheffield rod was applied in 6 patients and 8 hips, respectively. Circular or monoplane external fixators were used in 7 patients for the correction of deformities, lengthening and arthrodiastasis. 9 patients have benefited from various forms of bone transplant: pedicled grafts, auto- and\/or allografts. An original bone reconstruction procedure is currently being studied and will be useful in the treatment of large bone defects and the thickening of the gracile diaphyses, which consists in practice of a massive contribution of free bone grafts, auto- and\/or allogenic, bone substitutes and, in selected cases, periosteal substitutes, in a composite stratified construction. Postoperatively, 15 patients are able to walk while being supported by crutches or walking frames, 5 patients walk independently and 8 are still wheelchair-bound. It is important to mention that 8 children who were preoperatively dependant on the wheelchair are now walking! The surgical treatment in severe forms of OI must be adapted to each case. No matter the surgical technique used, well known or innovative, it is convenient if it restores the ability to walk of a youngster who has been forced to use a wheelchair for almost 20 years and who has suffered dozens of unsuccessful surgeries. The current paper mainly describes the difficulties the surgeon has to deal with while treating the severe, neglected cases of OI, sometimes incorrectly cared for and labeled as inoperable.

Group A achieved a higher rate of regular cycles, ovulation success, and conception than group B (71.4% vs. 38.1%; p=0.03), (76.2% vs. 38.1%; p=0.021) and (66.6% vs. 28.6%, p=0.01), respectively. Management with metformin + CC increased the ovulation and conception rates. ","1079":"Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon disease that results in gross morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated in its early stages. At onset, however, it is difficult to differentiate from other superficial skin conditions such as cellulitis. Family physicians must have a high level of suspicion and low threshold for surgical referral when confronted with cases of pain, fever, and erythema. We present ten cases of necrotizing fasciitis managed in a provincial secondary hospital in Oman over 3 years ago. A review of recent literature is also presented. ","1080":"Chagas disease is a complex disorder caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Most patients remain asymptomatic for several years and 30% of them progress quietly to developing cardiomyopathy. The factors that lead to chronic myocardial lesions are not fully understood. To investigate the association between clinical symptoms and single nucleotide polymorphisms in chagasic and non-chagasic women younger and older than 55 years of age. we analyzed Ala-9Val and Ile58Thr polymorphisms of the SOD-Mn gene, 138ex1ins\/del A of the endothelin-1 gene (ET-1) and H323H (T\/C) of the endothelin receptor A gene (ETA), by PCR-RFLP using genomic DNA from leukocyte of 85 women. We also evaluated serum lipid profile, renal and liver function, chest X-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiography (EchoCG). Biochemical profiling did not show differences between chagasic and non-chagasic patients. The polymorphisms analyses showed a significant association in the distribution of frequencies of the Mn-SOD Ile58Thr gene between both groups. Young chagasic patients had a significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities in X-rays, in ECGs and they showed grade II and III of NYHA functional classes. The chance of having an abnormal EchoCG was 5.87 higher in young chagasic patients (OR=5.87, 95% CI 1.47-23.4). We concluded that the parasite affects young females by accelerating the deterioration of cardiac function, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors and the cardioprotective action of estrogens present in the premenopausal stage. ","1081":"Most head and neck cancer patients are first referred to an E.N.T. specialist thus the need for that surgeon to be the leader of the multidisciplinary team. Oncological surgical interventions need to ensure clear resection margins; this means that whatever anatomic structures are involved in the tumor spread, need to be resected. The carotid artery is a vascular vessel system that provides blood supply for the head and neck region, the most important structure being the brain and its organs. The ligation or the resection of the common carotid artery leads to an abrupt decrease of blood flow towards the brain, which can cause single sided paralysis, decreased cognitive functions, shock and even death. Common or internal carotid arteries ligatures or resections can be performed in patients with malignant tumors of the head and neck. This is a synopsis of 2 successful cases of patients who underwent common and external carotid artery resection. ","1082":"The urinary abnormalities are an important health problem. If they are not recognized in due time, they usually lead to the loss of the renal unit function. In many cases, the diagnosis is late and incidental. We present the case of M.I., a 74-year-old male admitted in our surgical unit with diffuse left lumbar pain, low urinary tract symptoms and slow increase in abdomen volume in the past 4 years. Computer tomography scan and ecography showed a large left lumbar cyst like mass with a dilated supernumerary ureter with ectopic ureteral orifice in the prostatic urethra and apparently normal anatomic inferior renal unit. The goal was the excision of the \"cyst like\" mass (superior left renal unit) but because of the anatomical particularities (extensive fibrosis and local topographical changes) total nephrectomy was performed. Given a normal contralateral kidney, the discovery of a urinary abnormality can be a real challenge, their evolution being a silent one. This type of disease can be suspected only with the development of clinical symptoms. The anatomic particularities (duplex kidney) together with the long evolution of the disease changed the local topography making the preservation of the inferior left renal unit a difficult, almost impossible task for the surgeon. ","1083":"Over the years, the effects of the third molars eruption on the dental arches have been studied extensively. Still, literature provides less data regarding the effects of the orthodontic treatment on the third molars position. The aim of our study was to assess the positional changes of the third molars relative to the occlusal plane and to the second molar long axis, changes occurred during orthodontic treatment performed with or without premolar extractions. This study included 20 orthodontic treated patients: 10 of them with premolar extractions and 10 without premolar extractions. The pretreatment and post treatment panoramic radiographs were analyzed, and the angles between the third molar long axis and the occlusal plane and between the long axis of the third molar and the long axis of the second molar were measured. Changes in third molar position, from pretreatment to post treatment, for the two groups of patients were evaluated by using the Student's t-test. The results of the statistical analysis revealed an improvement in third molars position, the best results were seen in the lower third molars, in the group of patients treated with premolar extractions. ","1084":"The infertility defined as the incapacity of the people to conceive a child in a given period, usually of 1-2 years of sexually unprotected relations, represents a major dysfunction of the genital apparatus. Its frequency is estimated at 10-15% of the couples at the reproductive age. The incidence of sterility is high, a couple out of 10 being sterile. The conjugal sterility is a phenomenon representative for the couple; the woman is responsible for it only in 35-40% of the cases, in 40% of the cases, the male factor is involved. In 20% of the cases, mixed factors are met, both feminine and masculine, and in 5-10% of the cases, the causes cannot be detected. From the multitude of causes of infertility, the infectious factor plays an important role, the Chlamydia infections being lately blamed in the etiology of sterility. The infections due to Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT) represent the most frequent sexually transmitted diseases, which, most of the times lead to sterility. Taking into account the widespread of this bacterium in the sexually active population, the effective treatment of the CT infection is very important. We have selected 200 cases with PID genital infection in the study. All the selected patients had at least 2, 3 and more than 3 inflammation recurrence episodes, this way being considered cases with medium and severe forms of disease. All these selected patients had at least 2, 3 and more than 3 episodes of inflammation recurrence, this way being considered medium and severe disease cases. In conclusion, there is a high clinical efficiency of the azithromycin treatment in PID case. ","1085":"Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by jaundice and liver failure that generally occurs after decades of harmful alcohol consumption. Less severe forms of acute AH (AAH) frequently respond to alcoholic abstinence; whereas severe AAHs are characterized by a poor prognosis: up to 40-60% of these patients die within six months. Glucocorticoids currently remain the mainstay for treating severe AAH in patients with Maddrey's Discriminant Function score &gt; 32. Standard contraindications include recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, renal insufficiency and uncontrolled infections. The evaluation of concomitant viral infections (hepatitis C and B viruses) is mandatory. Liver transplantation (LT), in non-responders patients, is a possible therapeutic option for severe AAH, but it is rarely used because a 6-month abstinence period is required before listing for LT. Unfortunately, most of these patients die before the end of this sober period. In our opinion, in case of severe AAH and in case of patients with a good social support and without severe psychotic or personality disorders, the lack of pre-LT abstinence period alone should not be considered a hindrance to LT.

In addition, there are no particular recommendations in performing the serum serotonin assessment in order to evaluate the skeletal status. Aim. We aimed to correlate the bone turnover markers and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) with serotonin. There is a cross-sectional study in Caucasian postmenopausal women. They were not diagnosed with carcinoid syndrome, or bone anomalies, and received no treatment (including antiresorptives). We performed the bone formation markers: serum alkaline phosphatase (AP), serum osteocalcin (OC), and the bone resorption marker: serum CrossLaps (CL). Serum serotonin (high-pressure liquid chromatography), as well as central DXA (GE Prodigy) were assessed. 191 women of 57.1 years mean age were grouped according to DXA (WHO criteria). The linear regression analysis between serum serotonin and CL was not statistically significant (SS), between serotonin and OC was SS in the newly diagnosed osteoporosis group (N=40, r=0.4, p=0.03), between serotonin and AP we found SS in osteopenia group (N=88, r=0.24, p=0.03), with no changes when adjusting for age and BMI. The partial correlation between serotonin and BMD was not SS. The study raises the question of serotonin as a bone metabolism marker seeing that the results were not consistent. The main limit of our study is that we did not analyze the possible use of antidepressants by these women. Overall, this is a pilot study in clinical practice in which few reports have been published yet, but still necessary because the use of serum serotonin in current skeletal evaluation is still unclear.

Monopolar transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) is marked by a substantial morbidity rate requiring further amelioration. Small size tumors (under 1 cm) are feasible for \"en bloc\" resection. Bipolar TURBT was defined as being able to challenge the gold-standard status of monopolar resection due to the reduced complication rates. Plasma-button vaporization was introduced as a promising large bladder tumors' ablation modality. Narrow band imaging (NBI) cystoscopy became an increasingly popular method of enhancing tumor detection. The \"en bloc\" resection of small size or thin pedicle tumors provides the conditions for avoiding tumoral tissue scattering. Bipolar resection is characterized by decreased perioperative bleeding risks and faster patient recovery. Plasma-button vaporization gained confirmation as an innovative approach, able to dispose large tumor bulks under complete control while minimizing the associated morbidity. NBI cystoscopy is a useful tool in identifying CIS lesions, small papillary tumors or extended margins of large tumor formations. As a cost-free technique, it may be extensively used both during the NMIBC initial diagnostic as well as during follow-up evaluation protocol. Having in mind the various modalities of ameliorating the bladder cancer diagnostic and treatment, NMIBC management should be tailored in accordance with the particularities of each case.

For example, the focal infection theory, popular at the outset of the 1900s, suggested that systemic ailments could be traced to dental infections, which, in those days, were common, chronic, and often untreated. With the advent of modern dental and medical treatment, particularly antibiotics, this relationship was largely forgotten. Until recently, the discovery of relationships between periodontal disease and heart ailments, maternal oral health and prematurity of offspring, bidirectional interrelationships between diabetes and periodontal diseases, relationship of oral infections and chronic respiratory diseases and relationship between skeletal and oral bone mineral density, has brought a shift in the perspective. Research is now focused on the potential impact of periodontal diseases on systemic health. Thus, the impact of oral infection in systemic health defined a novel branch in Periodontology termed Periodontal medicine.

Two important areas are becoming the central research interest of subarachnoid hemorrhage: cerebral vasospasm and early brain injury. The authors have reviewed the major contributions in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage documented in the medical literature in the past 5 years. Treatments interfering with nitric oxide - or endothelin-pathways continue to show antispasmotic effects in experimental models of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Inflammation and oxidative stress play a vital role in the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm. Apoptosis, a relevant cause of early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage, also underline the etiology of cerebral vasospasm. Future research studies will continue to elucidate the pathophysiological pathways and treatment modalities targeting cerebral vasospasm and early brain injury, enabling an improvement in outcome for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. ","1093":"Gastrointestinal bleeding remains one of the most important emergencies in gastroenterology. It has been widely accepted that the first-line treatment for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, especially peptic ulcer bleeding, is endoscopic hemostasis. Several techniques are available to achieve hemostasis during endoscopy. However, some 5%-10% of the patients still experience recurrence of bleeding after initial hemostasis with combined endoscopic therapy including injection, thermal coagulation, or mechanical hemostasis. Endotherapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be challenging. A simple and effective method of endoscopic hemostasis would have a significant impact on the treatment of active gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemospray (Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA) is a novel hemostatic agent for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Its efficacy has been shown in peptic ulcer bleeding, as well as in cancer-related gastrointestinal bleeding and in patients taking antithrombotic therapy. These initial reports are very promising, but they are limited by the small number of patients. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of Hemospray in the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

In the semiotic approach, the message is a construction of signs, which, by interacting with the receiver, produces the meaning. The transmitter (the message transmitter) becomes less important. The focus is centered to the \"text\" and the way this is \"read\", the sense being born when the \"reader\" negotiates the \"text\". The negotiation takes place when the \"reader\" filtrates the message through the sieve of his cultural loading. A \"target public\" is a group which is specific to a certain Cultural Loading, a loading which deals with linguistic, logical, psychological and symbolic structures, which get out to meet the message and \"negotiates\" with the structures similar to it.

This article is meant to present the technique of proximal radial-ulnar ligament plasty using the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) tendon, as well as other techniques for the stabilization of a dislocated radial head. The ECRL tendon technique, quadrate and annular ligament reconstruction variant was first used by Gh. Burnei in 1985, at Mangalia Municipal Hospital, Romania. This study contains two clinical cases, a 6-year-old girl with congenital dislocation of the radial head, and a 10-year-old boy with traumatic dislocation of the radial head, both of whom were treated by open reduction and stabilization of the dislocation with the ECRL tendon, using the Burnei procedure. In both cases, the operation was successful in the reduction and stabilization of the dislocated radial head, whose position was maintained in flexion-extension and pronation-supination, and in the reconstruction of the annular ligament using Burnei's procedure, variant 2. Postoperatively, the clinical evolution was good, the patients having regained elbow mobility. The child with congenital dislocation exhibits normal flexion and pronation-supination within normal range, and the traumatic dislocation also exhibits normal flexion and pronation-supination limited with 20 degrees. Radiologically, in both cases the radial head is anatomically placed relatively to the humeral capitellum, in both flexion and extension. Stabilization of the radial head in traumatic or congenital dislocation can only be surgically achieved. Congenital dislocation of the radial head requires the reconstruction of the proximal radial-ulnar joint, preferably at a young age, in order to avoid subsequent complications, culminating in ulnar or radial nerve paralysis. Traumatic dislocation of the radial head is usually accompanied by the fracture of the ulna, but may be encountered in isolation. The Burnei procedure is an alternative for the treatment of radial head dislocation and is advantageous because of the use of a study, well vascularized tendon, which allows, when needed, the complete reconstruction of the proximal radial-ulnar ligaments, or just the annular ligament, in order to stabilize the head of the radius within the elbow joint. Also, the technique doesn't require osteotomies or an osteosynthesis requiring another surgery to remove the synthesis materials. ","1097":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a complex endoscopic technique that evolved from a diagnostic to a mainly therapeutic procedure. This was due to the identification of post-procedural complications that can follow both simple ERCP and that associated with the instrumentation of the biliary and pancreatic ductals. The identification of post ERCP complications in a proportion of 5 to 10% of cases, with a mortality rate of 0.33%, imposed their analysis and study of risk factors involved in their occurrence. The significance of post ERCP complications reveals the necessity of their avoidance by adopting additional measures if risk factors are identified. We have retrospectively analyzed 900 cases that underwent ERCP in the Surgery Department of \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Hospital in a period of 17 years. The complications of the procedure were studied. Among them, a special attention was given to post-ERCP acute pancreatitis (pERCP-AP), the most common complication that occurred in the study group. We also tried to find out and highlight the risk factors for this complication. ERCP is a relatively safe invasive procedure, yet it has complications (8% of cases), some of them potentially fatal (mortality 0.43%). The most common complications after ERCP are acute pancreatitis (3.7%), papillary bleeding (1.04%), retroperitoneal duodenal perforation (0.69%) and biliary septic complications like acute cholecystitis and cholangitis (1.21%). Acute pancreatitis is by far the most common complication. Risk factors for its occurrence are difficult sphincterotomy with precut use, failure of CBD desobstruction, pancreatic sphincterotomy, repeated injection of contrast in the pancreatic ductal system, dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi and the absence of changes of chronic pancreatitis. When risk factors are identified, the patients' selection must be very strict and diagnostic ERCP should be avoided in favor of non-invasive diagnostic methods (MRI-cholangiography, echo-endoscopy).

The aggressive surgical approach of umbilical hernia for patients with cirrhotic background remains a controversial problem, accompanied by anesthetic and surgical risk. Its indication remains fully justified in case of severe symptoms or life threatening complications: strangulation, incarceration, evisceration. This article evaluates results obtained by using dual-mesh alloplastic materials for surgical treatment of umbilical hernias affecting cirrhotic patients with incipient liver injury. Our lot consists of twelve patients with ages between 45 and 65 years, diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis, without other associated comorbidities. All patients were admitted for strangulated umbilical hernia. Among the analyzed lot, no decease was encountered, the morbidity being limited to two cases of parietal suppuration, solved conservatively, without the mesh removal. There were no ascitic fistulas. No recurrences were registered for a 12 months tracking period. The presence of cirrhosis implies a high anesthetic and surgical risk, the intervention being grafted by a substantial increase of mortality and morbidity in an emergency setting. The development of new alloplastic materials, together with the modern anesthetic techniques, allows superior results for patients with incipient hepatic injury.

The JLS is a rare heterogeneous entity characterized by facial dysmorphism, short-neck, short-trunk, normal sizes limbs, with multiple vertebral anomalies at all levels of the vertebral column and costal defects. The JLS has been classified into 2 major clinical phenotypes, based on the extent and distribution of skeletal anomalies, the pattern of inheritance and the prognosis. We report the case of a non-consanguineous 35-year-old female patient, with a history of multiple large leiomyomas gravida 1, para 1. A three-dimensional ultrasound at 18 weeks of gestation revealed: thoracic and lumbar hemivertebrae with abnormal alignment of the vertebral bodies and kypho-scoliosis, also the absence of two right ribs and abnormal shaped ribs. The biometric measurement was appropriate for gestational age and no other malformations were found. Although there was no previous history, based on the three-dimensional ultrasound findings a mild subtype of JLS was suspected. At term, the patient gave birth, by Cesarean section, to a male fetus, with a weight of 2700g, a length of 50cm and a calculated Apgar score of 9. The postpartum examination of the fetus confirmed the diagnose of SCD. The evolution of the newborn was good - he had no respiratory difficulty; he will benefit from an experimental surgery involving expandable titanium ribs. Our case illustrates the importance of an accurate ultrasound examination, which can be hindered by multiple large leyomiomas, in order to diagnose and to differentiate the two subtypes of JLS. The SCD can have a favorable evolution with the appropriate perinatal and postpartum care.","1101":"The imaging methods are more and more used in the clinical process of modern dentistry. Once the implant based treatment alternatives are nowadays seen as being the standard of care in edentulous patients, these techniques must be integrated in the complete denture treatment. The study presents some evaluation techniques for the edentulous patient treated by conventional dentures or mini dental implants (mini SKY Bredent) overdentures, using the profile teleradiography. These offer data useful for an optimal positioning of the artificial teeth and the mini dental implants, favoring to obtain an esthetic and functional treatment outcome. We proposed also a method to conceive a simple surgical guide that allows the prosthetically driven implants placement. Clinical case reports were made, highlighting the importance of cephalometric evaluation on lateral teleradiographs in complete edentulous patients. A clinical case that gradually reports the surgical guide preparation (Bredent silicon radio opaque), in order to place the mini dental implants in the best prosthetic and anatomic conditions, was presented. The profile teleradiograph is a useful tool for the practitioner. It allows establishing the optimal site for implant placement, in a good relation with the overdenture. The conventional denture can be easily and relatively costless transformed in a surgical guide used during implant placement.

The endometrial tissue implants itself outside the uterus and can be usually found in the pelvis or, in rare cases, it can be found nearly anywhere in the body. There are no pathognomonic symptoms of this disease, therefore, in some cases the tumors are incidentally discovered during surgery. Deep infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) is a rare form of this condition, which mostly affects the uterosacral ligaments, the rectovaginal space, and the upper third of the posterior vaginal wall, the bowel, and the urinary tract. We present the case of a 29-year-old pregnant female who was diagnosed with infiltrative endometriosis during the cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation. The tumors involving the vesicouterine peritoneum had a tendency of infiltrating the urinary bladder, but the patient had been completely asymptomatic prior to this incidental discovery. As cited by literature, the discovery and management of urinary endometriosis, as well as that of other localizations of DIE, is not based on high-level evidence data, but rather on case-series reported by surgical teams working in different centers worldwide.","1107":"A foreign body at the cricopharynx level is a common problem to any otolaryngologist worldwide. Coins, pencil tips, screws are usually found in children but are rarely seen in adults in the cricopharynx. We present an unusual case in a 30-year-old female who swallowed an Ayurvedic tablet. She complained of dysphagia and was unable to swallow even liquids. To our surprise, on the X-ray of the neck, a radiopaque shadow was noted in the cricopharynx. We removed it by hypopharyngoscopy and in the follow up period, the patient had no squeals. Any foreign bodies in the cricopharynx should be removed quickly to avoid complications like erosion. To our knowledge, the radiopaque shadow of a tablet observed on the X-ray of the neck is the first case being reported in the world literature.","1108":"Burkitt lymphoma has many forms of clinical presentations and, in children, it is usually discovered due to the presence of an abdominal mass. This rapidly growing tumor is highly malignant, aggressive, and may cause either indirect symptoms, due to pressure phenomena or direct involvement of the bowel lumen, leading to either intestinal obstruction or intussusception.

The energy captured by the molecules of these substances pervaded in the tumor cells is subsequently discharged in the surrounding tissue, triggering certain photodynamic reactions that result in the destruction of the tumor. The procedure is applicable in numerous medical fields. Skin basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most frequent type of cancer of the human species, is a cutaneous tumor that responds very well to this innovative treatment method. By reviewing numerous recent studies in the field, this article aims to present the role and the indications of photodynamic therapy in the management of basal cell carcinoma, as well as the most important results achieved so far by this therapy in the field of dermato-oncology.","1111":"Depression is the most frequent mental disorder encountered in all medical services. Multiple studies have shown that depression may predict the onset of different conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, stroke and many other. The relation between depression and diabetes is still unclear. In this study we evaluated patients with both major depressive disorder and type 1 or 2 diabetes, and observed the evolution of depressive and diabetes symptoms under adequate treatment. This observational, naturalistic study included 43 patients admitted in a psychiatric ward of \"Alexandru Obregia\" Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1 or 2. All patients received antidepressant and antidiabetic treatment. The majority of patients were women (60.5%), and the mean age was 49.7 years. Average hospitalization period was 23 days, with longer period of hospitalization of patients with DM type 1. Patients had severe depression. Mean value of fasting glycemia at admission was of 174 mg \/ dl, but it decreased at discharge, in paralel with the amelioration of depression. The depression associated with DM type 1 is more severe. These patients require higher doses of antidepressants and longer hospitalization period. Amelioration of depression seems to have a positive impact on the blood sugar level of depressed patients with diabetes.

It is generally accepted that androgens determine the characteristic features of PCOS; in this context, a hyperactive androgen receptor (AR) at the levels of the GnRH pulse generator in the hypothalamus and at the granulosa cells in the ovary, skeletal muscle or adipocytes senses initially normal testosterone and dihydrotestosterone as biochemical hyperandrogenism and might be a crucial connection between the vicious circles of the PCOS pathogenesis. Polymorphism of the AR gene has been associated with different androgen pattern diseases. Several studies have demonstrated an association between AR with increased activity encoded by shorter CAG repeat polymorphism in the exon 1 of the AR gene and PCOS, although there are conflicting results in this field. The phenomenon is more complex because the AR activity is determined by the epigenetic effect of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). Moreover, we must evaluate the AR as a dynamic heterocomplex, with a large number of coactivators and corepressors that are essential to its function, thus mediating tissue-specific effects. In theory, any of these factors could modify the activity of AR, which likely explains the inconsistent results obtained when this activity was quantified by only the CAG polymorphism in PCOS.","1116":"Breast carcinomas represent an important health problem. Understanding the development of breast cancer from precursor is critical for clinical treatment and prevention, however little is known about the molecular events involved in the progression to cancer. The advent of gene expression microarray technology provides a new powerful tool to assist in the determination of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. In this paper, we present the recent DNA microarray studies that describe how gene expression profiling is being used to classify specimens of breast carcinomas based on molecular properties of the tumor and to identify gene expression patterns related to clinical outcome. In present, data are available that show that gene expression profiles can be used to distinguish cell type-specific gene clusters (stromal, epithelial, mesenchymal and proliferation status) and to classify breast tumors as basal-like, luminal-like, ERBB2 overexpressing and normal breast-like. Profiles associated with good prognosis and poor prognosis of young axillary node negative patients have been identified. The microarray technology will become in the near future a molecular complement to histopathology and immnuhistochemistry.","1117":"There has been a steady growing trend during the last few decades to develop tools to monitor periodontitis, in the field of oral disease diagnosis. Since GCF has the chance of being closely approximated to the periodontal tissues where periodontal disease begins, it seems to provide more information than markers in saliva. In response to bacterial infection, host production of inflammatory mediators, may be the trigger for periodontal disease progression. Existing paradigms in the biology of periodontitis have supported the detection of elevated levels of these mediators in GCF. This article is the Part II of the review that deals with inflammatory mediators and host-response modifiers as the potential biomarkers present in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and the chair side point-of-care diagnostic aids applicable to monitor periodontal inflammation.","1118":"We report the case of an 11-year-old female with acute pancreatitis, and review the literature highlighting the presenting symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, and investigational tools that helped in the establishment of a correct diagnosis. First, the patient presented to a regional hospital reporting abdominal pain, vomiting and liquid stool. She was admitted with the diagnosis of acute surgical abdomen and underwent surgery. Upon admission in our department, laboratory findings showed high values for total lipids = 2600 mg\/dL and triglycerides 1200 mg\/dL. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a pancreas with a small enlargement of the head (19 mm), and with a heterogeneous structure of the parenchyma. Abdominal computed tomography showed small left pleural collection and a high-dimensioned pancreas, particularly at the head, with heterogeneous structure, and peripancreatic collections. The patient was treated by fasting, gastric decompression by nasogastric tube, and intravenous antibiotherapy followed by antialgic and antispasticity treatment. Time of the patient's first feeding was after the 7th day of hospitalization. The patient was discharged in a very good condition after 22 days of hospitalization.","1119":"","1120":"Estimated number of the Roma people in central-eastern Europe cannot be precisely appreciated, but official data suggest that in the 2004 they were approximately 4.2 million. At this time, there are few available data about the health status of the Roma people, mostly assessing genetic and infectious diseases, which reflect poverty, overcrowding, and lack of education. There is even less data regarding non-communicable and chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases. We searched the published literature on the cardiovascular risk factors in Roma people using PubMed from January 2000 to July 2011. The searching criteria were: (1) randomized, prospective observational, retrospective and meta-analysis; (2) adult patients with cardiac diseases or cardiovascular risk factors (3) data available for cardiovascular patients. Search terms included dyslipidemia, obesity, tobacco, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Twenty-five studies were identified. Approximately 75% of them were related to just four countries: Slovakia, Croatia, Czech Republic, and Serbia. This paper is a review based on existing literature concerning classical risk factors in Roma people with emphasis on their ethnical features. Despite limited data, the results showed that this ethnicity has the incriminated risk factors more frequently than the majority and consequently a higher cardiovascular morbidity rate. Quantification of the cardiovascular risk factor and their implication in the shortening of life expectancy in Roma population was a provocation due to a paucity of reliable data. At this time, we should pay more attention on the Roma health issues and the cultural concerns that might affect them in the context of borderless Europe. ","1121":null,"1122":"Patients with extensive burns (TBSA over 45%) can benefit from treatment with split thickness skin allotransplants (skin bank or honorific donors). In this study, we present our protocols for the surgical treatment by using allografts. We emphasize the criteria for the staging of the procedures, the prioritisation of the areas that need to be grafted and the postoperative management. The treatment includes a serial excision grafting with simple grafts or the sandwich method, which implies the covering of the wound with a widely meshed autograft (6:1). This layer is covered by a 1,5:1 or 3:1 expanded mesh allograft.","1123":"The cholinergic and nitrergic phenotypes in human fetal ganglia (inferior) of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves were overlooked in basic research. Lack of a positive neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) phenotype in the inferior vagal fetal ganglion was recently suggested to be an individually variable phenotype. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was not evaluated previously in ontogenesis. We aimed to evaluate these phenotypes in human midterm fetuses. Samples from five specimens with gestational ages varying from 4 to 6 months were used. Immunohistochemistry for nNOS, ChAT, neurofilaments, and S100 protein was performed. Neuronal somata were positively stained for nNOS, ChAT and neurofilaments in the inferior glossopharyngeal and vagal ganglia. S100 protein distinctively labelled the satellite glial cells ensheating the respective neurons. In human midterm fetuses vagal and glossopharyngeal inferior ganglia are nitrergic and cholinergic. To evaluate a functional role of these phenotypes in ontogenesis, the specific anatomic circuits should be further checked. Differences in immune labelling should be evaluated by use of similar antibodies from different manufacturers.","1124":"The authors present their experience over a period of 13 years (1998-2011) regarding a cohort of 54 patients. In an extensive loss of tissues resulted from congenital malformations (maxillary and mandibular malformations, micro stoma), collagenosis (scleroderma, Romberg Syndrome), traffic and work accidents, post surgical (cancer and facial nerve paralyze), when usual surgical procedures fail to establish the normal look of the patient medical grade long-term implantable silicone endoprosthetic reconstruction (rehabilitation) intervenes.  Using a specific technique and materials like long-term implantable silicone grade, the resulted endoprostheses replace and create the aesthetic and a normal anatomy of the specified region, very well tolerated, elastic and non-allergic and with a perfect acceptation from the body all the life.","1125":"This study was performed between 2007-2012 and encompasses 94 patients. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group included the patients who have benefited from surgical treatment (42 cases) and the second one included patients who benefited from conservative treatment. Out of the total number of cases, 63 cases showed an intact simple bone cyst that was most of the time an accidental discovery. 31 patients presented with fracture sustained on a simple bone cyst. There were 63 boys and 31 girls. Their mean age was 9.9 +\/- 2.34 years. Single injection was performed for 49 patients; the rest had double or triple injections. The mean follow-up was 34.5 +\/- 6.6 months. The procedure succeeded in obtaining healing in 77 cysts (82%). Cyst index of more than five and cortical index of less than 1 mm were significantly prone to pathological fractures and had significant poor results after treatment. Our results suggested that an autogenous bone marrow injection is a safe and effective treatment method for simple bone cysts, when compared with the surgical management, but sometimes-repeated injections are necessary. Cyst index and cortical width are good indicators for treatment outcome.","1126":"According to the world Health organization, approximately one third of the world` population older than 15 years are smokers. Evidences indicate that both in men and in women, cigarette smoking affects reproductive health more than the consumption of caffeine or alcohol in comparable doses. The mechanisms according to which tobacco affects spermatozoa are poorly understood. Some of the studies focused on the relation between cigarette smoking and the principal semen analysis, variable such as concentration, Morphology and Motility. In this study, we compared the sperm parameters between smokers and non-smokers. This case control study was done on men from infertile couples who were referred to Yazd research and clinical center for infertility but the cause of infertility was not the male factor. The semen analysis was compared between the smokers and non-smokers. 151 infertile men were enrolled in the present study. 98 non-smokers and 53 smokers the mean age of patients was not significantly different between groups. There were no significant differences among groups according to sperm concentration (P-Value 0.108), Morphology (P-Value 0.138) and Motility (P-Value 0.082). Also there were no significant relationship between sperm parameters and the amount of cigarettes people had used (based on Pack\/year scale). Semen parameters (Morphology, Motility and concentration) were lower in smokers but there were no significant differences between groups. ","1127":null,"1128":"Tumour antigens are poorly expressed, heterogeneous and they modulate rapidly. As a result, their recognition and elimination by the immune system is very difficult. There are several mechanisms, by means of which, the host can neutralize oncogenesis and prevent it from occurring.  The sentinel lymph node concept has brought about a revolution in the surgical treatment of the regional lymphatic basin while preserving the prognostic value of the regional lymph node status in breast cancer.  This prospective study included 93 women with early breast cancer with initial indication for surgery in whom the sentinel lymph node technique was employed. Cell immune response was assessed prior to surgery by means of in vitro mononuclear cells blastic transformation assay (BLT), of immunoglobulin (Ig) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) measurements.  The results were correlated with tumour size, presence of positive sentinel lymph node, tumour proliferation and growth markers (Ki-67, c-erbB2, bcl-2).  Even in its less advanced stages, breast cancer is more aggressive and associates with an increased rate of sentinel lymph node metastases in patients below 50 years old, the tumour size exceeds 20 mm, with the presence of peritumoral lymphocytic infiltrate, positive Ki-67 and bcl-2, an alteration of T helper (Th) lymphocytes function, increased immune suppression through IL-2 decrease, signalled by blastic transformation indexes modifications and a drop in IL-2 production (p&lt;0.01).","1129":"Otitis media with effusion (OME) is one of the most frequently met pathologies in small children. Long-term persistence of the liquid in the middle ear cavity correlates with the impairment in speech acquisition and poor results in school. To evaluate the predictive value of impedancemetry in recovery of the normal middle ear status. 30 children (age 4 month-9 years) with OME were periodically monitored by means of tympanometry. The children were treated with the same treatment protocol for 7 days minimum and tympanometry was repeated after seven and fourteen days. After follow-up tympanometry at 7 days, children with abnormal middle ear condition were randomly allocated into two groups: one, which continued the same treatment for another 7 days and one group with no treatment for the next 7 days. After 7 days, 64% of the patients had an improvement in tympanometry (type C tympanogram) and 10% had a complete resolution of the middle ear effusion (type A tympanogram). After 14 days, tympanometry was normal in 74% of the patients (53.9% rate of success in the no-treatment group). Complete resolution of the middle ear effusion is obtained in various periods of time, depending on numerous factors, with an appropriate treatment. Tympanometry proved to be a good tool in predicting the length of the treatment.

Though the pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, it is well established that CHC plays an important role in several immune mediated conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. We focused on the clinical particularities of patients with CHC and associated RS and we specifically investigated the anti-inflammatory role of IFN-alpha concerning the rheumatic symptoms.","1132":"This retrospective analysis evaluated the efficiency, safety, and medium term postoperative results of bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) in prostate cancer (PCa) cases associating complete urinary retention. A series of 40 patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic PCa and complete urinary retention requiring a Foley catheter indwelling underwent BPV aiming to restore spontaneous voiding. A total of 35 patients completed the one year evaluation protocol consisting of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life score (QoL), maximum flow rate (Q(max)) and post-voiding residual urinary volume (PVR), measured at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. BPV was successfully performed in all cases with satisfactory efficiency, as confirmed by the mean operation time (42.8 minutes) and hemoglobin drop (0.7 g\/dl). A fast and safe postoperative recovery period was described in this series (hematuria rate--7.5%; mean catheterization period--36 hours; mean hospital stay--2.5 days; early-irritative symptoms' rate--15%). At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, satisfactory values were determined in terms of IPSS, Qmax, QoL and PVR. These parameters emphasized a stable evolution throughout the entire follow-up, as 88.6% of the patients maintained spontaneous voiding. The present trial confirmed the plasma-button vaporization as a promising therapeutic approach in PCa cases associating complete urinary retention. The technique displayed good efficacy, low perioperative morbidity, short convalescence, and satisfactory urodynamics and symptom score parameters during the one-year follow-up period.

Unfortunately, it is little known and reported on how advertising companies make more effective pharmaceutical drugs commercials. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how neuromarketing techniques may impact the consumer response to pharmaceutical advertising campaigns. The result shows that using neuromarketing methods a pharmaceutical company can better understand the conscious and unconscious consumer's thoughts and tailor specific marketing messages.","1134":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a non-invasive method, which can be performed following a routine Magnetic Resonance investigation within the same examination, and can provide very useful molecular information related to the metabolism and function of the normal and pathological structures of the brain. Its role is increasing in the establishment of a clear diagnosis, in both focal and diffuse central nervous system diseases, and the tendency is to replace the histopathology test, in certain cases, with similar or sometimes better diagnostic accuracy. This paper summarizes the principle, method, and main clinical applications, standing as a guide to procedure performing and results interpretation.","1135":"The presence of albuminuria has long been recognized as an adverse prognostic feature in patients with renal disease: the patients with appreciable albuminuria are much more likely to develop tubulointerstitial scarring and fibrosis and progress to end-stage renal failure. For many years, it was thought that excess albuminuria was simply a marker of a more severe renal disease, which was more likely to progress as a result of this severity rather than as a result of the albuminuria itself. This conviction was strengthened by the general assumption that albumin was a benign or inert molecule serving primarily to exert oncotic pressure and act as a carrier within the circulation. More recently, this view has been challenged with the accumulation of evidence suggesting that albumin is able to influence the function of cells with which it makes contact in the manner of a signalling molecule.","1136":"Depression is a debilitating disorder estimated to become the second cause of morbidity worldwide by the year 2020. The limited efficacy of antidepressant therapy, as well as the major negative consequences of this disorder, has stimulated additional research in order to determine possible adjunctive treatments. There is mounting evidence linking dietary patterns to major depression development.  This article presents some of the most significant findings concerning the role of nutrition in major depressive disorder. Although more focused and clear results are needed, the correlation between nutrition and mental health is gaining attention. Now, there is evidence supporting the importance of nutrition in maintaining good mental health. We emphasize multiple findings that support adherence to healthy dietary patterns, taking into account that the production of neurotransmitters need, among others, right amounts of nutrients, a lot of which can only be supplied through diet. Not only certain nutrients are needed for proper brain functioning, but also others can be harmful, promoting depression. The Mediterranean diet has been linked to a low prevalence of depression while fast-food consumption has been found to increase the risk of developing and aggravating this disorder, hence the need for nutritional interventions.  From the perspective of discovering modifiable risk factors, the role of nutrition in psychiatry could be more important than it was initially considered.","1137":"Radical neck dissection is a concept that was presented in 1906 by GW Crile and suffered constant improvement ever since. The surgical oncology procedure included the resection of the internal jugular vein, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the submandibular gland and the spinal accessory nerve. Deformities and impairment in the functionality of different regions of the neck and scapular regions have great implications on the quality of life of the patients who undergo such a procedure. Modifications to the radical neck dissection were made in the attempt to maintain the efficacy of the surgical oncology therapy. The authors try to assess the functional implications of radical neck dissection and the impact on the quality of life for patients with head and neck neoplasia.","1138":"To delineate the psychological profile of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A triple questionnaire of 614 items (including psychological and medical ones) was given to 10192 respondents and the results were analyzed by means of Cronbach alpha and Chi square test, together with an ad-hoc designed method that implied ranking and outliers detecting. Anxiety and depression are general psychological tendencies unspecifcally linked with IBS. Among the features with a relatively more specific correlation with IBS, tension has the strongest association, followed by the inclination to endure unacceptable situations, preoccupation for health, and susceptibility, and then by fear of failure and sense of demanding profession. IBS individuals readily accept a subordinate position, which may be connected to their history of tyrannical parents, and also to their preoccupation for authority factors. The sense of being treated unfairly by the authority persons during the school years nuances this last feature. Some features that bring some nuances to this psychological portrait are: contemplative nature and analyzing tendency, preoccupation with health issues, a reserved, unsociable, and precautious nature, clinging to known circumstances. ","1139":"Researchers involved in the delivery of periodontal therapy are currently investigating the possible use of oral fluids in the diagnosis of oral diseases and drug development. Substantial improvements have been made in the understanding of the mediators implicated on the initiation, pathogenesis, and progression of periodontitis. This review will analyze the mechanisms involved in the breakdown of periodontal supporting tissues during chronic periodontitis and highlights the potential array of biomarkers present in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), which may relate to existing or predicted tissue regions undergoing metabolic change.","1140":"In this review report, current possibilities of evaluation of quality of life in Parkinson's disease have been critically presented. Health Related Quality of Life (-HRQoL) comprises a wide spectrum of consequences of the disease. Measurement of quality of life has become increasingly relevant as an outcome parameter, especially in long-term trials. Most of the available QoL instruments depend on patient self-reports. The data can be collected by written questionnaires. There are universal questionnaires of QoL--for many diseases and the specific ones--specially created for one disease. Among universal questionnaires, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Short-Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) are the most popular in Parkinson's disease. As for specific questionnaires: the Parkinson`s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL) have been described.","1141":"Most patients with colon cancer are surgically treated, with postoperative association of chemotherapy and possibly immunotherapy in advanced cases. Surgical treatment is chosen depending on the evolution stage, tumor topography and the existence of complications, colonic surgery being dictated by colonic vascularization. The radical character of the surgical intervention can be assured only in the early stages of the tumor. Colostomy is rarely necessary in patients with colon cancer. In the period of the last 5 years (2007-2011), 307 patients with colon cancer were operated in \"Colentina\" Surgical Clinic, radical intervention being possible only in 219 cases. 48 cases were emergency interventions for occlusion or perforation with peritonitis. Every time the mechanical preparation of the bowel was not possible, the intraoperative washout technique was used. Postoperative complications were met in 27 cases, being represented by bleeding (3 cases), peritoneal abscess (5 cases), anastomotic fistula (7 cases), abdominal wound infection (12 cases). In 5 cases the operation was done laparoscopically. Preoperative mortality was of 13 cases. Postoperative chemotherapy was done in the great majority of cases.","1142":"To delineate the psychological profile of individuals prone to FD-like symptoms (FDLS). A triple questionnaire of 614 items (including psychological and medical ones) was given to 10192 respondents, the results were analyzed by means of Cronbach alpha, and Chi square test, together with an ad-hoc designed method that implied ranking and outliers detecting. FDLS appears to be an accompanying feature of many (if not most) human emotions and are more frequent in anxious, timid, pessimistic, discontent, irascible, tense, success-doubting, unexpected-dreading individuals, bothered by persistent thoughts and tormented by the professional requirements and the lack of time. A higher degree of specificity might have: chiefly fear of failure, susceptibility, and tension, secondarily emotivity, fear of unpredictable events, sense of insufficient time, preoccupation with authority factors, and tendency to endure unacceptable situations, and also faulty patience and lack of punctuality. Rumination appears to be the psychological tendency most strongly associated with FD. Nocturnal epigastric pain seems to indicate a submissive nature but a rather responsibilities-free childhood, while early satiety is associated with inclination to work and responsibility and preoccupation with self-image. The superposition of FD symptoms with biliary and esophageal symptoms cast a doubt over the distinctness and even the materiality of the various functional digestive disorders. ","1143":"LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE BINDING PROTEIN (LBP) is an important mediator of the inflammatory reaction. A multitude of factors can determine the genic transcription activation and the increase of the LBP in the blood and the human body humours: Il1, Il 6, lipopolysaccharides, Gram-negative bacteria, as well as non-infectious agents. This paper is a prospective study performed on 147 patients admitted for acute appendicitis in 2010-2012 and evaluates the dynamics of LBP in acute appendicitis, by identifying the correlations between the pre- and post-operatory levels of LBP (up to 72 hours after surgery) and the anatomopathological type (i.e. catarrhal, phlegmonous and gangrenous). The mean pre-op LBP values are significantly different as to the histopathological result (p&lt;0,005). Among the biological inflammatory markers measured in this present study, LBP has a dynamics of its own in the catarrhal and phlegmonous appendicitis. Thus, if after the surgical removal of the infectious source, the leukocites and neutrophiles decrease 72 hrs after surgery, LBP continues an ascending curve. The importance of this study consists in the introduction of last generation LBP-type inflammatory markers' dosage in the cecal appendix pathology. This implementation is brand new in the Romanian surgical practice. The good correlation between the LBP pre-op values and the histopathological diagnosis of the appendicits form that we discovered during the present study opens the way to large-scale use of the biochemical dosage of LBP in the management of acute appendicitis.","1144":"The incidence of ureteral lesions varies between 0.1% and 30% depending on the type of the surgical intervention. However, the surgical interventions in Obstetrics and Gynecology are responsible for 50% of the total iatrogenic ureteral lesions. Sadly, only 1\/3 of the iatrogenic ureteral lesions are recognized during surgeries and 25% of the unrecognized cases of ureteral lesions lead towards the loss of the damaged kidney, while a delayed diagnostic may also lead to a progressive deterioration of the renal function. On this matter, of decreasing the rate of morbidity and the following forensic risks, the gynecologist surgeon must be able to anticipate the potential apparition of a specific ureteral lesion, based on the known risk factors of the patient, so that he can then prevent the iatrogenic ureteral lesion.","1145":"Thalassemias are inherited blood disorders. In 2011, there was no clear situation regarding the number of thalassemia or other hemoglobinopathy patients in Romania. The luck of information has led to an increased number of patients registered by Fundeni Hospital, Bucharest in the last years. The main goal of this article is to underline the importance of implementing a screening program in Romania for thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies, parallel with an awareness program. The importance of this objective is strongly supported by the following example: in Sardinia, thalassemia major was present in one out of 250 births, and has declined to one out of 4000 births after they implemented the screening program. The article is written by Monica Rosu, a participant to the World Wide Opportunities for Woman course, held in Canada, in 1999 and states one of the first results of thalassemia awareness in Romania with a positive impact on the patient's life, registering the following results: 2000: A website in Romanian language regarding thalassemias and addressed to patients was created. 2005: The Association of People with thalassemia major was founded and become member of Thalassemia International Federation. 2011: Thalassemia major patients from Romania have access to free treatment and the latest medical oral chelator, Exjade. The association participated in various meetings addressed to patients and doctors as well, created their own website, held workshops, fought together for an improved quality of life for themselves, for healthy people (possible thalassemia carriers) and for all Romanian children.","1146":"Since May 2005, we have started to treat the intracranial aneurysms endovascular way as an alternative minimally invasive technique to the classic neurosurgery treatment. Studying the patients' demographics, clinical presentation, aneurysm size and configuration, type of coils used for embolization, the percentage of compaction and recanalization (especially in patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage), and immediate complications. An all-inclusive retrospective review of every patient who underwent coils embolization (stent or balloon assisted included) of saccular aneurysms from May 2005 to September 2011 was performed. A total of 116 patients (46 men and 60 women) and 124 aneurysms were treated. A total of 96 patients (41 men and 55 women) underwent follow-up femoral cerebral angiograms (mean follow-up was 25 months and the longest was at 37 months). Five patients required intra-arterial abciximab due to thrombus formation. Four patients had aneurysm rupture while the coil was being advanced. Eleven patients were treated during vasospasm peak. Seven patients had recanalization at 12 months follow-up. The average hospitalization period was of 4 days. There is a close relation between Hunt and Hess scale score before treatment and post interventional neurological status. Due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, the vasospasm remains a threat to the patient's neurological status. The treatment of cerebral aneurysms with endosacular embolization by coils is a safe and durable option. The risk of recanalization or re-rupture in our cohort is small compared to series published elsewhere. Larger series of patients are needed to support our evidence. ","1147":"Primary aldosteronism is the leading cause of secondary hypertension, the management of this disease requiring an interdisciplinary approach. Evaluation of evolutionary features of patients with secondary hypertension and primary aldosteronism. We have followed 26 patients diagnosed with secondary hypertension and primary aldosteronism, who were admitted consecutively to \"C. I. Parhon\" Endocrinology Institute between 2004-2009. Of the 26 patients, 17 had adenoma producer of aldosterone (APA), 8 had bilateral adrenal hyperplasia idiopathic (HIA) and one patient had adrenal carcinoma (with hypersecretion of aldosterone). The mean age of the cohort was of 49.3 years (44.9 years for adenomas and 52.6 years for bilateral hyperplasia). The evaluation of the patients included clinical examination, electrocardiogram, Holter BP, echocardiography and determination of plasma aldosterone and renin. The evolution of the patients with primary aldosteronism was different depending on the anatomoclinic type. In patients with idiopathic bilateral hyperplasia, medical treatment has improved control of hypertension and cardiac and cerebrovascular complications rate was moderate. In patients with unilateral adenoma producing aldosterone, blood pressure had higher values and more frequent complications, but surgical cure of adenomas significantly changed the prognosis of patients. In both cases, the presence of hypokalemia was an additional element of severity. Regardless of the primary aldosteronism, hypertension was directly involved in cardiac and cerebrovascular complications. Individualization of treatment according to the anatomoclinic type determined a significant improvement of the patients' prognosis. ","1148":"Gallstone ileus represents a rare complication (0,3-0,5%) of a serious, but common disease-gallstones, which affect around 10% of the population in the USA and Western Europe. Associated diseases (usually severe), elderly patients, delayed diagnosis and therapy due to late presentation to the hospital, account for the morbidity and mortality rates described in literature. We present the case of a patient with partial colon obstruction due to a large gallstone that was \"lost\" during an emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The calculus eroded the intestinal wall, partially occluding the lumen, triggering recurrent Kerwsky-like, subocclusive episodes. The intraperitoneal abscess has spontaneously drained through the subhepatic drain and once the tube has been removed, a persistent intermittent fistula became obvious.","1149":"Methanol poisoning is a relatively rare but potentially serious medical emergency. Toxicity results when methanol is successively oxidized to the active metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid. We report a case of a 23-year-old male, a high daily alcohol consumer, who attended the local primary health care centre complaining of sudden visual loss. A presumed diagnosis of methanol intoxication was suggested based on the patient's visual impairment and the history of alcohol ingestion. Specific therapy was initiated before a definitive diagnosis. Gas chromatographic determination of methanol levels confirmed the initial diagnostic suspicion. In this case, prompt recognition of methanol intoxication and treatment conditioned a favorable clinical outcome. Given that timely diagnosis and antidote administration are crucial issues in terms of prognosis, we underline the necessity for physicians to be alert for entities provoked by rare environmental factors.","1150":"Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men 15 to 35 years old. Histological subtypes are seminoma, non-seminoma and mixed tumours (partly seminoma and partly non-seminoma). Seminomas are more sensitive to radiation therapy and are easier to cure than non-seminomas. The surgical treatment is either orchiectomy, either orchiectomy plus lymph node dissection of the involved ganglia. We present the case of a 42-year-old man with scrotal pain, important swelling and erythema admitted into our surgical unit. Clinical exam and ultrasound revealed a testicular augmentation of 6\/15 cm. Radical orchiectomy was performed and the patient was further referred to the oncology department. Even though the common causes of scrotal erythema with local swelling and pain are orchiepididimitis and testicular torsion, a careful examination followed by a precise ultrasound can reveal a developing testicular tumor, which was complicated by inflammation. Moreover, a careful anamnesis hints to the development of a tumor as the patient was operated on for cryptorchidism in childhood. Orchiectomy followed by radiotherapy in seminomas, has a cure rate of 70 to 100%. ","1151":"The carcinoid tumor of the appendix is one of the most common tumors of the appendix, but one of the rarest anatomic locations of carcinoids. The prognosis is very good, as most tumors are incidentally discovered during surgery for acute or sub-acute appendicitis. The diagnosis is exceptional when combined with pregnancy. We present such a case of a 27-year-old female patient. An emergency appendectomy was performed, and soon after, pregnancy was confirmed. The patient had a tumor smaller than 1 cm in diameter, at the tip of the appendix. The immunochemistry revealed the neuroendocrine profile by positive reaction for chromogranin A and synaptophysin, with a ki-67 profile at an undetectable level. After surgery, the neuroendocrine markers and the octreoscan were negative, consequently indicating a favorable prognosis. Further follow-up is necessary, even though not all the authors recommend it (considering the low index to the associated metastases, especially for small appendiceal tumors). A short review of the literature is presented, starting with this case report.","1152":"The incidence of malrotation has been estimated at 1 in 600 live births. An increased incidence of 0,2% has been found in barium swallow studies, whereas autopsy studies estimate that the true incidence may be high as 1% of the total population. The clinical manifestations are elusive; therefore, the diagnosis must be based on the presence or absence of the acute obstruction. Radiologic investigations, especially those using contrast substances, are the ones used most often in the diagnosis of malrotation. Laparoscopy may give the clinician a valuable tool that will help him diagnose the rotational anomalies and correct the potentially obstructing lesions with minimal surgical trauma to the patient. The role of the surgical treatment is to prevent volvulus and to treat any kind of obstruction. Ladd's procedure provides all the elements for reaching this goal. The following report describes a particular case of one female patient, 8 years old, admitted in our clinic with signs of intestinal obstruction. She had similar episodes in the last three months, but the symptoms had resolved spontaneously. Upper gastrointestinal series showed an anomaly of rotation and barium enema discovered a tight stenosis on the transverse colon. Emergency surgery using laparotomy enabled diagnosis. Intraoperatively, a right mesocolic hernia and a transverse colon extrinsic stenosis due to abnormal peritoneal attachments were noted. Colon obstruction due to peritoneal bands is extremely rare. The clinical manifestations are not specific and we need radiologic procedures to help diagnose the disease. The cause of the obstruction is not always evident despite the availability of modern imaging techniques. Since preoperative diagnosis is difficult, morbidity and mortality can be decreased by an early surgical intervention. ","1153":"Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and may constitute a treatable cause of secondary hypertension. Fibromuscular dysplasia is frequently affecting children as the main cause of RAS, but is very rare in adults. We present the case of a 19-year-old overweight patient, with no known pathological conditions in her medical history or family background, admitted for severe, pulsing headaches during the past 3 months and increased blood pressure (BP) values for about a month (maximum BP 220\/140 mmHg). The initial clinical exam and first-line imagistic methods did not provide a high suspicion for RAS. However, the invasive methods established the diagnosis of right renal artery medial dysplasia. Balloon angioplasty was the treatment of choice.","1154":"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a relatively rare lung disorder, probably under diagnosed, characterized by the accumulation of lipoproteinaceosus material in the lung alveoli. The primary (acquired or idiopathic) form occurs in more than 90% of all cases. Whole lung lavage is considered the golden standard of treatment. In this report, we describe a rare case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with severe and incapacitating respiratory, in which whole lung lavage followed the thoracotomy for spontaneous pneumothorax. A 34-year-old white male patient presented at the respiratory intensive care with severe respiratory failure, aggravated in the last two months, cough, night sweats and important weight loss and left spontaneous pneumothorax. The initial diagnosis of diffuse interstitial pneumopathy was revised to Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis after bronchoalveolar lavage. Active pleural drainage of the pneumothorax was unsuccessful and after two months, surgical suture of the lung was performed under general anaesthesia. One month later a whole left lung lavage was performed. The same procedure was also performed on the right lung. Eight months later the patient had a good exercise tolerance, normal arterial blood gas (ABG) values, and persistent ground-glass opacities in some of the pulmonary segments on CT scan. The most severe forms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, in which hypoxemia and cyanosis occur, have a high mortality risk during anaesthesia and whole lung lavage. When a rare complication like spontaneous pneumothorax occurs, the suturing of the pulmonary apical blebs seems to be the only viable solution, despite the high risk of dehiscence of the sutures due to the poor pulmonary tissue integrity at the time of the whole lung lavage and during postoperative care. ","1155":"Jejunal diverticula are an uncommon acquired disease that is usually silent and asymptomatic. When symptomatic, they present with chronic nonspecific symptoms like pain, nausea, malnutrition and sometimes with acute presentation like gastrointestinal hemorrhage, peritonitis and obstruction. The majority of complications seen as an acute abdomen similar to appendicitis, cholecystitis or colonic diverticulitis but they also may appear with atypical symptoms. We are presenting a 63-year-old male reported in emergency with painful abdomen and diagnosed as having peritonitis. On laparotomy, we incidentally found giant and multiple jejunal diverticula along with ileal perforation. Nothing was done to the jejunal diverticula, as these were multiple and non-obstructive. In the follow-up of 16 months, the patient was doing well. Jejuno-ileal diverticulosis is a rare condition that continues to present formidable challenges in diagnosis and treatment.","1156":"A correlation between urothelial bladder tumor incidence and exposure to various occupational toxic factors was established for more than a century. The aim of our study was to establish the relationship between these two features. We analyzed one hundred consecutive bladder tumor patients treated in \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Hospital, Department of Urology. These cases were studied concerning their occupation and pathological findings. We identified 58 patients having potential urothelial bladder tumors inducing occupations: dye industry, motor vehicle drivers and miners. Among these patients, the incidence of muscle invasive tumors was of 33%, of the high-grade tumors was of 69%, of the multiple tumors was of 60% and of the associated CIS lesions was of 38%. All these rates were significantly lower in the non-occupational hazard group: 12%, 26%, 29% and 14% respectively. Exposure to occupational toxic factors seems to influence the evolution of urothelial bladder tumor into more aggressive patterns. Further studies in this regard are necessary. ","1157":"HIV infection is continuously raising, and different treatments did not manage to extend the patient's life. Clinical and morphopathological features of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hematological and nervous system are well characterized in HIV infection, but cardiac involvement is not so well known. Cardiac involvement is extremely rare in HIV disease, but demonstrated by echocardiography and anatomo-pathologic methods, it is more frequently met than the clinical features are supposed to be, and it can be demonstrated by positive serologic tests.The main reason of this research is the necessity to obtain data from HIV infection concerning heart involvement.","1158":"Complications within laparoscopic surgery, similar to classic surgery are inevitable and require immediate actions both to diminish intraoperative risks and to choose the appropriate therapeutic attitude. Peritonitis and hemorrhagic incidents are both part of the complications aspect of laparoscopic surgery. Fortunately, the incidence is limited, thus excluding the rejection of celioscopic methods. Patient's risks and benefits are to be analyzed carefully prior recommending laparoscopic surgery. This study presents a statistical analysis of peritonitis consecutive to laparoscopic surgery, experience of \"Sf. Ioan\" Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, and Department of Surgery (2000-2010). There were 180 (0,96%) complicated situations requiring reinterventions, from a total of 18676 laparoscopic procedures. 106 cases (0,56%) represented different grades of postoperative peritonitis. Most frequently, there were consecutive laparoscopic appendicectomia and colecistectomia. During the last decade, few severe cases of peritonitis followed laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures. This study reflects the possibility of unfavorable evolution of postoperative peritonitis comparing with hemorrhagic incidents within laparoscopic surgery. ","1159":"Cancer disease is continuously rising worldwide as far as its incidence is concerned. Efforts were made in order to identify the etiologic factors. A good example for exogenous factors is Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which is largely spread worldwide, over 90% of the adult general population being infected by it. EBV is believed to be implicated in Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, etc. In this paper, we will try to present the experience of two centers in Cluj County involved in the treatment of pediatric cancer, focusing on the influence of the presence of Epstein Barr virus in the outcome of the neoplasia. we took into account the clinical data regarding histology, stage of the disease, titer of specific antibodies for EBV, serological and imagistic evaluations of the patients treated in a retrospective consecutive manner for 5 years--2005-2010. Regarding our cohort of 120 patients, we analyzed the items in the paper in detail together with the statistical analysis and searched for a link between the intensity of the infection of EBV and response, disease, free survival, toxicities of the treatment. there are few data concerning the influence of EBV regarding the outcome of pediatric neoplasia. The published studies suggest a positive influence of EBV especially in Hodgkin disease mixed cellular subtype. In this study, EBV negative patients do better than the EBV positive, but the infection with EBV protects the patients against hematological toxicities. ","1160":"Peyronie's disease appears to be a condition of middle-aged men. In many of them, the disease is accompanied by erectile dysfunction, which, until recently, was attributed to penile deformity. Later, it turned out that the erectile dysfunction has the same causes as in men without Peyronie's disease with vascular and psychological components. In all cases, the pathology of the disease is characterized by the formation of a fibrous plaque, which will lead to penile curvature at different degrees and directions during erection and pain. These symptoms will have a major impact on the sexual life of the patients. The most common, the plaque, is located on the dorsal side of the penis, leading to dorsal deviation. The use of penile prostheses can ensure the development of a normal sex life by correcting the penile deviation and by providing the necessary rigidity for penetration.","1161":"","1162":"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a worldwide high prevalence disease, is associated with a large variety of rheumatic manifestations. For most of these affections, pathophysiologic correlations are not well established. Some of them, such as diabetic cheiroarthropathy, neuropathic arthritis, diabetic amyotrophy, diabetic muscle infraction, are considered intrinsic complications of DM. For others, like diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis or reflex sympathetic dystrophy, DM is considered a predisposing condition. In most cases, these affections cause pain and disability, affecting the quality of life of diabetic patients, but once correctly diagnosed, they often respond to the treatment, that generally requires a multidisciplinary team. This article reviews some epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of these conditions.","1163":"This review presents the pharmacotherapeutic approaches available in the treatment of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although its etiology is multi-factorial, currently, the main therapy is to decrease intraocular pressure. New therapies are being developed; the current trend is a retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection. Neuroprotection is achieved by combining antihypertensive agents with drugs that directly protect the optic nerve by promoting cell survival and inhibition of neuronal signals that initiate apoptosis. The treatment should also preserve the ocular hemodynamics, ensure proper patient compliance and be free of side effects.","1164":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease preventable in up to 50% of the patients by lifestyle modifications. The preventive strategy for the decrease in the incidence and mortality of CRC is based on understanding the relations between the environmental and genetic factors. The most important identified risk factors for CRC are aging, personal and familial history of CRC or adenomas, hereditary colon cancer syndromes, dietary patterns, and inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to update data referring to environmental and genetic documented factors and CRC risk. Using data from the Medline database, we analyzed reports on CRC risk published between 2000 and 2010. We realized a classification taking into consideration the relative risk (RR) reported for each analyzed factor (RR ranged between 1 and 6.87). The highest RR were represented by the patients with distal advanced cancer (RR = 6.7) and those with high dysplasia adenomas (RR = 6.87). In the future, evaluation and optimisation of screening options will stay at the base of new prevention strategies that will be implemented based on the influence of risk factors identified in each population.","1165":"Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common congenital heart malformation that produces cyanosis. It consists of four different defects of the heart: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary artery stenosis (blockage of blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs), right ventricle hypertrophy and dextroposition of aorta. Echocardiography is essential in establishing the diagnosis of patients with cardiac malformation. Patients with Fallot tetralogy present a higher frequency of major non-cardiac congenital disorders. The association with congenital scoliosis influences vital and functional overcomes, restricting physical activity and lowering life expectancy. The author presents therapeutic management on the clinical case of a 13-year-old child with Fallot tetralogy and congenital scoliosis. Therapeutic management of both illnesses consisted in serial surgical interventions as it follows: first time at the age of six years, cardiac malformation was solved, and later, at the age of 13 years the correction of spinal deformity was performed.","1166":"Thymic epithelial tumors have been traditionally classified into two main types: noninvasive and invasive thymoma. Several classifications have been proposed for thymic tumors, but according to these classifications, the prognosis of patients with thymomas varies considerably. Our purpose is to present different CT aspects according to various subtypes of thymic epithelial neoplasms based on the simplified World Health Organization classification. In this article, we will discuss and illustrate histologic and functional features of the thymus and a spectrum of thymic tumors associated with Myasthenia Gravis. Smooth contours and a round shape are the most suggestive of type A thymic epithelial tumors, whereas irregular contours and heterogeneous enhancement are the most suggestive of type C tumors. Calcifications are suggestive of type B tumors. CT findings may serve as predictors of postoperative recurrence or metastasis for the thymic epithelial tumors.","1167":"Zinc (Zn) is an important element in human body and in the last period of time there were a lot of studies regarding its importance. It is significant for the good working of many organs. A special attention was given to the importance of the serum Zn in patients with renal failure. Among the micronutrients, zinc may rank with iron with regard to its importance for public health. This article reviews some epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of these conditions.","1168":"Background - hypothesis and objective: In the past decades, extensive burn care has improved to the extent that burn victims can now frequently survive. Current treatment of a severe burned patient extends beyond the preservation of life and function; the ultimate goal is the return of survivors, as full participants, back to their families, work field and communities. Methods: This paper is based on our experience in treating patients with extensive burns. We had two panels as follows: 148 subjects with extensive burns in one original retrospective study (2002-2009) and other 47 new patients with extensive burns enrolled in other original prospective study (2010-2011). We selected the subjects with extensive burns who received allotransplant (n = 59). Our study aimed to identify and quantify the main psychosocial difficulties in patients with extensive burns who received allotransplant, also taking into account the surgical procedures applied in each case. Results: One of the major problems a surgeon faces is the nature of the decision he has to make regarding a treatment (conservative versus operative), based on the exact determination of burn wound depth. In case of early excision, deep lesions and suitable grafting represent the chosen surgical treatment in our center. The benefits of skin allografts are well known due to their contribution to burn management. Conclusions &amp; discussion: This paper is designed as a guideline and instruction manual to help those with less experience through particular situations in surgical burn care. Early excision and immediate coverage of the burn wounds represent nowadays the standard care for extensive burned patients. For patients with massive thermal injury, temporary coverage with allografts is essential. The use of allograft has multiple benefits because it plays both as physiologic and mechanical barriers.","1169":null,"1170":"The authors present their personal experience regarding the reconstruction of the nasal pyramid on 150 cases, encompassing both children and adults during the period 2000-2011. Reconstruction of the nasal pyramid, regardless of age, was performed in cases of dysmorphias due to congenital malformations, accidents and surgical treatments with great loss of substance (benign or malignant tumors). There were used the classical methods of reconstruction meaning rhino correction and rhinoplasty. However we mainly focused on the use of heterografts (implantable silicone implants - endoprostheses), or on the reconstruction of the nasal pyramid entirely with elastomeric silicone (epitheses), fixed with adhesive, implants and titanium magnets. Silicone, as a synthetic material, is very well tolerated by the body, having been demonstrated that it is a good oxygen carrier. Moreover, both nasal silicone and titanium implants are well tolerated as well and, in addition, they have good aesthetic, functional and psychological results. Patients regain an almost normal appearance, having good family and social integration and improved quality life.","1171":"","1172":"The pancreas is a bulky gland, with mixed secretion, exocrine and endocrine, attached to the duodenum, participating through its secretions in carbohydrates digestion and metabolism. For a long time, it was considered a mysterious organ, with an inaccessible, examining and exploring due to its deep retroperitoneal position. We intend to make a comparative analysis of pancreatic microanatomy, between the examination of the necroptic-collected pieces and the ex vivo pieces, intraoperatively, with the patient's prior consent. We aimed to deepen the qualitative micro anatomic study on the pancreas parts of dissection, and quantitative study of the vessels micro anatomic normal pancreatic body. The methods and techniques used were the anatomical study through dissection and intraoperative and qualitative micro anatomic study by making blades of pathological sample products taken from patients: extemporaneous and microscope examination.","1173":"Background: One major objective in medical units specialized in caring for patients with severe neurological lesions is to reduce the incidence of pressure sores. Objective: A purpose of this article is to give solutions regarding the way to decrease the incidence or progression of pressure ulcer development and offer recommendations for appropriate treatment of pressure sore(s). Material and methods: A systematic literature search was performed based on a practical perspective, a comparative study with two components was conducted: a retrospective and a prospective one regarding the efficiency of a set of prophylactic and therapeutic measures, concomitantly with an enlarged treatment options panel and accessibility to the patient referred. Discussion: It should be pointed out that one characteristic of pressure sores - supplementary enhancing their poor prognostic - is their tendency to recurrence, often meaning augmentation of their severity no matter the therapeutic endeavors approached. Therefore, prevention remains the key point in medicine and in particular for pressure sores: saves the patient from unnecessary suffering, requires less time and expenses allocated from the budget department. Conclusion: Patients needing neurorehabilitation associate immobility at high risk for the development of decubitus ulcers. The most efficient way to prevent and treat pressure sores, is to early asses and identify their general and respectively specific risk factors in each patient and consequently to promptly initiate prevention or curative appropriate measures.","1174":"Rationale: Recovery of autonomy, in paralyzed\/with severe disabilities patients, is one of the most difficult challenges for rehabilitation. Thus, an appropriate wheelchair is essential for this kind of people, both in daily lives, including work and social participation, and for quality of life (QoL). Objective: The purpose of the study is to achieve a consistent improvement to the actual models of wheelchairs followed by validation through clinical trial of the optimized prototype, in order to enhance the users' autonomy and QoL. Material and Results: In the research activities and for establishing constructive and optimized functional solutions will be used, simulation of system operation techniques, based on software packages and Computer-Aided Design\/ Engineering (CAD\/ CAE) systems. Validation, of the optimized wheelchair prototype, through clinical trial, requires a prospective study. The study will include a group of 30 patients, who will be investigated for a one-month period. The patients will complete, at the end of the study, a standardized questionnaire containing generic data and many items referring to the optimized wheelchair functions and to the autonomy of the users including in relation to their own expectations. We will also use the quantified evaluation scale of QoL, Wheelchair Outcome Measure (WhOM) and a Falls Concern Scale for people with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI-FCS). Discussion: The wheelchair particularities that we pursue, and which are distinguished from the other models, is the fact that the wheelchair is powered, pliable and allows verticalization, hopefully at a price comparable or even lower than the current state of the art models (but none of them succeeded by now to fulfil all this three basic functions on a single \"all in one\" such device). Hence, if our optimized prototype will achieve technical and clinical validation, this will result in a significant enhancement of autonomy and QoL for the users.","1175":"","1176":"To correlate computed tomographic (CT) appearance of the thymus with results from histologic examination of thymic tissue in myasthenic patients who underwent thymectomy. A retrospective study, based on case series report, between January 2000 and December 2010 on 247 patients with generalized myasthenia gravis or myasthenic syndrome explored by CT using a specific protocol, in the Radiology and Medical Imaging Department of Fundeni Clinical Institute. All subjects in the study were operated and had a histologic evaluation. CT examinations of these 247 subjects showed remaining thymic mass, remnant of thymic tissue, fatty infiltration of the thymus and tumoral thymus or focal thymic mass. The results of histologic examination showed normal thymus, thymic lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, thymic atrophy, fatty infiltration and thymoma. It was a 100% correlation between CT examinations and intra-operative findings regarding the presents of focal thymic masses in our study. In the diagnostic of focal thymic mass, the only inter-disciplinary correlation is between radiological and macroscopic aspects. CT examination has a limited value in differential diagnosis between thymic lymphoid follicular hyperplasia and thymoma. ","1177":"Background: Violent behavior is often met in patients with mental health disorders. An important area of research studied different factors that can influence aggressive behavior in psychiatric patients. Objectives: The paper's aim was to compare different characteristics between two groups of patients, who presented with psychiatric disorders and aggressive behavior. Demographic characteristics, diagnosis, use of alcohol, history of brain injury, physical and verbal aggression were analyzed in both groups. Methods: The first group was formed of 23 mentally ill patients framed into the Article 114 Criminal Code who presented aggressive behavior and committed various offences. In the second group, 45 patients admitted at psychiatry without their consent were included, after having committed different acts of aggression. Results: The patients from the first group had significantly more psychiatric admissions in their history than the patients from the second group. A higher percentage of alcohol users was registered in the first group, compared to the second one. More patients with personality disorders and concomitant use of alcohol were present in the first group, compared to the second group. In both groups, aggressive behavior was more frequent in patients having psychotic disorders, compared to other diagnosis. Even if overall aggression was more frequent in the second group, when alcohol use (with or without brain injury) was present, aggressive behavior became more frequent in the first group. Conclusions: Results of the study suggest that when certain conditions are met, they can significantly influence the behavior of psychiatric patients, with notable differences in each group.","1178":"Background: The diagnosis and management of the patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases have become dependent on immunological criteria. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping is used for rapid and specific diagnosis but there are cases when we are not facing a typical immunophenotype, so there is a constant need to find new markers and new combinations of markers that would allow the improvement and the development of our diagnosis. Aim: Our aim was to evaluate CD 200 expression in different B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. CD200 is a membrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and the over-expression of CD200 has been reported in a number of malignancies, including CLL, as well as on cancer stem cells. Methods: We analyzed the CD200 expression in 122 patients diagnosed with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (100 patients with CLL, 10 patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 10 patients with MCL and 2 patients with hairy cell leukemia), in the Department of Hematology of the University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest. We performed immunophenotypical analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration on BD FACS Calibur flowcytometer. Results: CD200 was brightly expressed in all 100 CLL patients (100%). In SMZL patients, CD200 was dim positive (40%-60%), in patients with HCL. CD200 was also bright positive (96% and 97%) and in patients with MCL CD200 was negative (1-10%); CD 200 was significantly higher in CLL patients compared with other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. We found 14 patients with CD19, CD5 positive population and CD23- , but with high expression of CD 200. Cyclin D1 was negative on bone marrow biopsy in 13\/14 of these patients. (1\/14 patients were without bone marrow involvement); Conclusions: CD200 has a great impact in diagnosing B- chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, especially when we want to determine the origin of a CD19, CD5 positive population and distinguish between CLL and MCL. CD 23 is a reliable marker in those cases, but, as we showed, CD23 might have a lower specificity than CD200 for CLL. We added CD200 in our panels in order to diagnose chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, not to replace CD 23, but to improve and save time in our diagnostic process. The high expression of CD200 in CLL and HCL could open the option for new- targeted therapy (anti-CD200).","1179":"Adrenal surgery has been radically changed by laparoscopic approach and we wonder whether the increase in the number of adrenalectomies is entirely justified by better understanding of the pathology and a developed diagnosis methods. The type of approach (transabdominal\/retroperitoneal) remains a matter of the surgeon's experience. Method: In the past 8 years, we have performed more than 200 laparoscopic adrenalectomies by transperitoneal approach, 24 of them having previously significant abdominal surgery (cholecistectomy, gastric surgery, colectomy, bowel obstruction, exploratory laparoscopy, and adrenalectomy). The patients had a variety of adrenal pathologies such as Cushing disease, Cushing syndrome, Conn syndrome, incidentaloma, pheochromocytoma and even carcinoma. Results: 3 cases were converted to open approach, only one because of the adhesions. Reasons for conversion were also: spleen intarctisation and a difficulty in mobilizing the tumor. Operating time was not significantly prolonged because of the adhesions (40-360 min, median time 127 min). Postoperative evolution was simple with no morbidity or mortality and a fast recovery was recorded. Conclusions: Choosing the type of approach is related to surgeon experience, although 79-94% of the surgeons prefer the transabdominal lateral approach. We believe that with an experienced surgical team, there is no difficulty in performing adrenalectomy by transabdominal approach, with no significantly prolonged operating time, even though the patient has previously had abdominal surgery.","1180":"The infertility of the couple represents a constant preoccupation of the modern society; the supervision of the fertility of the population has become a necessity today, as a result of the behaviour and habitat modifications, which the modern life has generated.

However, beyond the attempt of practically solving infertility, at the world level, the specialists in the field of reproduction have projected evaluation and supervising couple fertility programs, trying to delineate the responsible factors of this reality.","1181":"Ischemic colitis occurs as a result of the decrease of arterial blood supply at the level of the colon and may have consequences which vary from completely reversible lesions to ischemic necrosis. It is a condition that affects both sexes, predominantly people over the age of 50, having multiple etiologies in which the main role is played by atherosclerosis. The symptomatology varies from mild symptoms, which are reversible, to severe ones, with a vital risk. The colonoscopy does not show pathognomonic signs, but it has high sensitivity due to the involvement of the mucosa. There are different treatments according to the clinical form. In general, it goes into remission spontaneously. Emergency surgical treatment is required in acute pancolitis, toxic megacolon, massive hemorrhages, when a subtotal colectomy is performed.","1182":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is still one of the most common hematologic malignancies. Finding a curative solution is the objective of numerous followed cases and clinical trials. Diagnosis is based on the interlocking of classic elements and newly identified prognostic factors but time to first treatment is still an open issue. CD38, ZAP 70, IgHV gene mutational status and cytogenetic changes are proven negatively influence the evolution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Whether through aggressive rapid evolution or by the difficulty of obtaining a complete remission or risk of early relapse, CLL is still important. Adapted to these prognostic factors, combined therapeutic regimens have proved to be effective in achieving a durable complete remission, new agents, with encouraging partial results, being studied. Requiring initial screening, for comparative purposes, a current and growing importance has minimal residual disease; its absence at the end of treatment represents a strong positive prognostic factor.","1183":"Biological complexity of mechanisms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHAI) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B (CLL) and the relation cause \/ effect between these two diseases has been extensively researched, but currently is still far from being completely understood. It is known that the immune system has an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases but also in the chronic lymphoproliferative malignancies. In this process of autoimmunity associated with immunodeficiency, the CLL neoplastic cells, the non-malignant B cells, T cells, and the cellular microenvironment cells are also involved. CLL pathological lymphocytes change peripheral immune tolerance acting as an antigen presenting cells and \/ or cells expressing inhibitory cytokines. The two subpopulations of T cells also have an important place: self-reactive T helper cells (TH) and regulatory T cells (Treg). The Fas \/ Fas ligand - cell death mechanism has a significant role both in maintaining cellular homeostasis, malignant hematopoietic cell expansion and the development of autoimmune disorders, including AIHA. The article reviews the etiopathogenesis of the autoimmune mechanism of AIHA in CLL, and its impact on the prognosis and long - term survival of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia B.","1184":null,"1185":"","1186":"Introduction:We present the case of a 36-year-old patient who was treated in the National Institute of Neurology and Cerebrovascular Diseases in Bucharest - in the neurology and the imagistic departments - for bilateral carotid dissection. Goals: The main goal of this article was to discover the cause that lead to the symptoms of the patient using MRI and angio-MRI.In the process,we tried to dilate the stenosis (due to dissection) on 2 internal carotid arteries by using stents in order to keep the true lumen open. Methods:In order to make a diagnosis we used the Magnetic resonance imaging machine (MRI) (1,5 T from GE), the multislice Computer Tomography (CT) scan (16 detectors from Siemens) and the digital substraction angiography (Siemens Axiom Artis). In addition, we used the same angiography machine for the endovascular procedure. The stents that we used were Wallstents from Boston Scientific Company. Results: The patient left the hospital having a NIHSS=10, with dysarthria and left hemiplegia that were 80% recovered after 2 months. Discussion: The particularity of this case study is the spontaneous bilateral internal carotid dissection. The second dissection might have resulted in being also iatrogenic, due to several attempts of stenting the first one. Conclusions: The successful treatment of this patient was the result of the collaboration between the neurology and neuroradiology departments.The first therapeutic option in carotid dissection has to be stenting, under certain conditions.","1187":null,"1188":"","1189":"CLL patients are more exposed to develop a second neoplasm, but the association. CLL-MDS is an unusual one.

At diagnosis, the blood tests showed leucocytosis, with lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Due to the negative prognostic factors, the patient received treatment with an alkylating agent (FC protocol) and then with alemtuzumab. Three years after being diagnosed with CLL, the patient presented with malaise, recent faintness and fever, with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. The results from the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy established a new diagnosis: myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient's general condition was rapidly deteriorating and just two months later, he evolved into acute myeloid leukemia, subtype 6, a very rare type of AML. Soon after, neurological alterations led to cerebral hemorrhage and death.

The ability to guide the growth of neural extensions was proven by laser. Synapses produced with laser have the instability as main disadvantage, in the absence of high densities of neurons. The main mechanism of synapse formation is the synaptic plasticity. In this case, dendritic learning spines increase in size and are transformed in dendritic memory spines. The goal of this study was to evaluate if the creation of synapses using laser, without cell disruptions, is feasible. We have stimulated neuronal guiding growth using a laser system called multipoint optical tweezers. Approaches were made between dendrites and neuronal bodies. Normal mechanism of synapses formation was stimulated by using electrical stimuli, applied by using a patch-clamp set-up. This approach revealed the transmission of electrical stimuli on both sides of the synapse, but also its unidirectional transmission, which is correlated with cell integrity. The feasibility of achieving laser synapses was proven, and this method can be useful for the development of neural circuits, and for the modulation of the existing ones. We suggest that light is the best tool to guide neural growth and synapse formation. This method is cost efficient and very easy to perform. Our model is very good for understanding molecular mechanisms in pathological neurons that are relocated in key positions from pathological tissues or from transfected cell lines.

A close connection between the etiology and the clinical features needs to be outlined, in order to have a more appropriate treatment approach. This study aims to find common clinical features for two groups of Class II division 1 etiological factors (heredity and the vicious habit of sucking the finger), outlining a characteristic dento-facial pattern for each etiological factor. 160 orthodontic cases were studied, taken randomly from the Department of Orthodontics in \"Carol Davila\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, between 2005 and 2011. From a total of 46 diagnosed with Class II\/1, the following data were noted for each subject in a table: age, sex, etiology, facial symmetry, profile, size of the lower face, stage lip, labiomentonier ditch, menton, form of arches, palate, occlusion in the three plans, Spee curve, other dental anomalies. The facial asymmetry was found in a greater proportion within the finger-sucking group. Subjects in the finger sucking group have 100% pronounced convex profile, with pronounced lip stage and sharp curve of Spee, being known that the thumb-sucking stops the mandible growth and stimulates the upper jaw protrusion. The predominant etiological factor is heredity and the clinical features obvious for II\/1 Angle anomaly are present in the highest proportion in the thumb-sucking group, but no significant differences were observed between the groups studied according to etiology. ","1194":"The robotic surgery has come through the development of telemedicine and minimally invasive surgery concepts, being developed in the military medicine by NASA during the years 1970-1980. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present our experience in the new field of the robotic surgery, by analyzing the results obtained over a lot of 20 patients operated with the \"da Vinci\" robot within the last 5 years in the Clinical Emergency Hospital Bucharest for various abdominal defects.","1195":"We report our experience with bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease. Between November 2009 and November 2010, 3 patients with adult polycystic kidney disease underwent bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in our institution. Indications for bilateral nephrectomy included recurrent cyst hemorrhage, impaired gastrointestinal function and early satiety due to direct intestinal compression by large polycystic kidneys, and anatomical lack of space for future renal transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the records of these patients and we are reporting our experience. All three patients successfully underwent bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy with a mean operating time of 208 minutes (range 195 to 220). There were no conversions to open procedure. Blood loss was less than 100 ml in all cases. Mean renal unit size was of 2037 g (range 1798 to 2214). Hospital stay ranged from 10 to 12 days. One patient developed a chest infection postoperatively and suffered from a prolonged ileus. Another patient developed a retroperitoneal hematoma, which was treated conservatively. Bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy is a feasible and safe procedure in adult polycystic kidney disease patients, which has potential benefits of a shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and mortality in comparison to open procedure. ","1196":"High-grade obesity raises some specific problems regarding the endourological approach. The aim of our study was to determine if this pathology might influence the outcome of retrograde ureteroscopy. We evaluated the outcome of 88 ureteroscopies performed in highly obese patients during the last 5 years. The data were compared with the results of 88 consecutive ureteroscopies performed in normal weight patients. The success rate in the study group was of 91% by comparison with 95% in the normal weight group. The use of flexible ureteroscopes was imposed in 17% of the obese group vs. 11% in the control group. The complications rate (all mild) was of 6.8% in the obese group vs. 4.5% in the normal weight patients. The differences between the two groups, although present, were not statistically significant. However, in two cases with obesity, the weight of the patients was too high for the operating table, imposing supplementary sustaining measures. Ureteroscopic treatment of stones in obese patients is an acceptable treatment modality, with success rates similar to non-obese patients. Sometimes it may require some logistic measures in the operating theatre. ","1197":"given the recalcitrant behaviour of pseudarthrosis in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT), there is no ideal solution to treat such challenging deformities. The reconsideration of the already known principles, by using the modern technology, may generate new treatment methods. the present paper presents the preliminary results of an original reconstruction procedure used to treat large bone defects in paediatric orthopaedics. A case series study, the surgical technique, complications and illustrative cases are presented. 3 cases of pseudarthrosis in OI and 2 cases of CPT were operated by using this technique. The principles of the method are to create an optimal osteoconductive and osteoinductive environment by using a bone autograft, bone allograft and bone graft substitutes and to provide a good stabilisation of the bones. We operated 3 patients with OI and 2 patients with CPT. Four patients had multiple previous surgeries. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 28 months. Four of the five patients are able to ambulate independently at the moment this paper was written. we believe that the present technique could be a reliable alternative to other procedures, especially in cases of repeated failures. ","1198":"Glomus tumor (glomus cell tumor) is a rare, hamartomatous, usually benign neoplasm, whose cells resemble the modified smooth muscle cells of the normal glomus body. The diagnosis of a lower extremity is often delayed, due to the lack of awareness and low level of suspicion, by the treating physician. The glomus tumor (GT) often involves the nail beds. The unusual location of the lower extremity often leads to missed or delayed diagnosis and management. There is a paucy of information about GT in general, especially among orthopedic surgeons. The aim of this article is to make the surgical community more aware of this disease.","1199":null,"1200":"Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis (AAH) is a syndrome of progressive inflammatory liver injury associated with long-term heavy intake of ethanol. Mild to moderate forms of AAH frequently respond to alcoholic abstinence, whereas severe AAH is characterized by a poor prognosis. Up to 40% of these patients die within 6 months upon symptoms onset. This high rate of mortality is due to different factors: liver failure, severe infections, and portal hypertension with variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). In AAH, HRS is a common complication that leads to the death of more than 90% of the patients within 3 months, unless they had been liver transplanted. Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Stent Shunt (TIPS) has been increasingly used in the management of portal hypertension and its complications, and, it might become a valuable option in patients with HRS awaiting LT. This study has taken into consideration 9 consecutive patients affected by severe AHH with HRS suitable for TIPS. We have determined serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, sodium urinary excretion and urine volume in all patients, before the intervention, 7 days and 30 days after TIPS. Seven patients were transplanted within 6 months. After TIPS, the renal function improved with significant reduction in serum creatinine and increase in urine volume. We can conclude that TIPS is a valuable option in patients with severe AAH complicated by HRS and are waiting for liver transplantation.","1201":null,"1202":"Hydatid disease is a parasitic disease that is endemic in many parts of the world, especially in South America, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the Mediterranean region, including Turkey.

This site of localization is very rarely diagnosed on ultrasonography.","1203":"Peyronie's disease is still a therapeutic dilemma for the urologist. Although medical treatment includes multiple versions, few therapeutic agents had significant effects. The combination between oral therapy and intralesional agents can improve the quality of life of the patients with Peyronie's disease.","1204":"Highly active antiretroviral therapy for AIDS sometimes engenders inflammatory manifestations resulting from an inappropriate and unbalanced immune-system restoration, called Immune Reconstitution inflammatory Syndrome, which, in turn, can unmask a subclinical infection\/pathology. Despite our patient's evident syndrome, the atypical clinical, microbiologic and radiologic feature of Pneumocystis pneumonia made its diagnosis difficult.","1205":"Enucleation implants are covered with a material that allows the fixation of the extraocular rectus muscles. Usually, the implants are covered in donor sclera, which implies the risk of infection transmission, inflammation and implant rejection, being also an expensive procedure. The new materials used for implant meshing should be tested and a safer and cost effective solution should be researched. This study presents the results obtained after a 15-year use of an original prosthesis for the reconstruction of the orbital cavity after enucleation surgery. 42 eyes of 42 patients who underwent enucleation surgery for choroidal malignant melanoma were included in the study. The surgical technique was very similar to the classic enucleation, the major difference being the implant of a prosthesis made out of a Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) ball covered by a Polyethylene terephthalate (dacron) shell used in cardiovascular surgery. All the patients had a very good technical result, without the inflammation of the orbital cavity, conjunctiva or eyelids, which demonstrates a very high material tolerability and an excellent cosmetic result. Late implant expulsion appeared in 7.14% of the patients (3 cases). The particularly good results obtained by using this technique, the absence of an inflammatory reaction after surgery, and the long lasting stability of the implant, recommend the method as being safe, with no major complications and a good esthetic result. ","1206":"In the era of mini invasive surgery, the surgical approach of the esogastric junction occupies an important role, which regards both the results and the complete, long-term patient satisfaction.The main benign pathology of the esogastric pole includes hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cardiospasm, oesophageal diverticula. The present study is based on the experience of our clinic in the laparoscopic treatment of esogastric pathology that contains 85 patients in 10 years. Out of these, 15 were operated on for cardiospasm, 29 for hiatal hernia and 41 for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The investigation protocol consisted in barium swallows and endoscopy, both pre and postoperatively. The results obtained allowed us to underline the superiority of the surgical treatment over the medical one. Likewise, medical literature reports rates of success of 90% in antireflux surgery. The latter is conditioned by correct determination of the reflux causes and by the choice of the adequate time to perform the surgery, in concordance with the local anatomical conditions. As far as the two techniques used (complete or partial fundoplication) are concerned, there were no significant differences in the postoperative evolution of the patients, but we have to mention, nevertheless, the increased incidence of dysphagia after Nissen. The data presented confirm the superiority of laparoscopic surgery over the classic one, due to the superior aesthetic result, the shortened admission time -with reduced costs and rapid social reinsertion.","1207":"Hyponatremia is a frequent complication of the advanced liver disease, being, as the hepatorenal syndrome, a consequence of the important circulatory dysfunction of cirrhosis. Hyponatremia is determined by the impaired capacity of the kidney to excrete free water, which leads to water retention disproportionate to sodium retention, thus causing low plasma osmolarity. Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, its presence suggesting a very advanced liver disease. Current evidence suggests that hyponatremia affects the brain function and predisposes to hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, hyponatremia is a risk factor for liver transplantation, being associated with a high frequency of complication and affecting short and long-term post-transplant survival.","1208":"The medical and biological long-term research led to the discovery of some general laws that govern the stimulation of the tissue growth and the regeneration, and this is called: the \"tension stress\" law.It was found that a gradual tension of a living tissue creates a stress what can stimulate and maintain the regeneration of the active growth of that specific tissue. A slow traction, the constant of a tissue, will make it become metabolically active, resulting in an increase of the proliferative and biosynthetic functions. These processes are so dependent on an adequate blood flow at the tissue that it is elongated, but they are also dependant on the stimulatory and functional effect of the carrying weight.The clinical application of this biological law allowed, for the first time, the control of the healing process and the remodeling of the bone and the soft tissue, which allows the development of some new methods of treatment of the diseases caused by the inequalities of legs.","1209":"The ability to tailor biologic therapy based on the status of tumor biomarkers and monoclonal antibodies has become very important in the last years. The role of tumor biomarkers in treating colorectal cancer, specifically the K-RAS gene, was identified. K-RAS had a higher interest after Lievre and colleagues reported at the 2008 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, their analysis of K-RAS mutations in tumors from patients who did not appear to benefit from cetuximab therapy, providing additional data involving K-RAS mutant tumors and their lack of response to cetuximab, as part of first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Furthermore, other trials evaluated the K-RAS status and the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, the treatment of refractory metastatic cancer and dual-antibody therapy in the first-line treatment of colorectal cancer. Patients with mutant K-RAS colorectal tumors have no benefit from cetuximab, no matter the type of chemotherapy regimen.","1210":"Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a significant burden on caregivers, which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. The disease decreases patients' capacity for activities of daily living and quality of life.

In this paper the most commonly used scales evaluating activities of daily living and quality of life in Alzheimer's disease, either generic or specific, is presented.","1211":"Due to the improvement of prognosis through adjuvant therapy, the life expectancy of neoplasia patients is continuously increasing, which, in conjunction with the progressive occurrence of parastomal hernias during the disease evolution, explains the growing number of reported parastomal hernias affecting patients with permanent colostomy. Conventional techniques of local repair are inappropriate considering the high recurrence rate, and the decision of stoma relocation depends on the associated pathology, which may counter-indicate general anesthesia, and on previous surgical interventions that are usually followed by a dense peritoneal adhesion syndrome. The purpose of this article is to make known a variant of alloplastic technique, without translocation, with a low degree of invasiveness, which can be performed successfully under spinal anesthesia, followed by a reduced period of hospitalization. The study group consisted of 6 patients with permanent left iliac anus who underwent these interventions one to three years prior to the occurrence of parastomal hernia. Patients were followed at 1 year and 2 years postoperatively and the results were favorable, with no recurrence and improved quality of life through proper prosthesis of the stoma. We suggest that this technique variation is applied to small and medium parastomal hernias, in case of patients with permanent left iliac anus, with the declared intent of minimal invasiveness. ","1212":"Nephroureterectomy with perimeatal cystectomy is still the gold standard in the treatment of urothelial upper urinary-tract carcinoma (UUTC). Ureteral endoscopic surgery was proposed as a complementary first step in nephroureterectomy, in order to obviate the low abdominal incision. Our goal was to establish the value of a novel method of endoscopic distal ureteral management in on step nephroureterectomy for UUTC: pluck technique by using bipolar plasma vaporization. During the last two years, we performed nephroureterectomy with pluck transurethral detachment of the intramural ureter by using bipolar plasma vaporization in 42 cases with UUTC (pTa in 16 cases, pT1 in 10 cases, pT2 in 9 cases, pT3 in 7 cases). The tumor was pyelocaliceal in 34 cases, ureteral in 7 cases, and both ureteral and pyelocaliceal in 1 case. The follow-up was performed by cystoscopy with urinary cytology, ultrasonography, intravenous urography and CT. The mean follow-up was of 14 months (range 8 to 26 months). All procedures were completed successfully. The complications rate was of 4.8%: 2 cases of hematuria, one imposing an endoscopic approach and another one treated conservatively. During follow-up, 6 patients had bladder recurrences, 1 had renal fossa tumors and 1 had secondary lymph-node invasion. The disease-specific mortality rate was of 4.8%. The endoscopic approach of the terminal ureter with bipolar plasma vaporization as part of one-step nephroureterectomy is a safe, facile and effective method offering good oncological results. ","1213":"External radicular resorption is a pathological process that generates the loss of cementum, dentin and bone, almost irreversibly, involving vital and pulpless teeth. The early stage is asymptomatic and might be diagnosed by a routine radiograph or a clinical examination. Radicular resorption appears because of cementoclastic, dentinoclastic or\/and osteoclastic activity. The process of resorption is associated with a damage of the periodontal ligament as a result of injury and necrosis, macrophages are the first cells that are detected, followed by multinucleated cells, odontoclasts, which affect the cementum and dentin.","1214":"There is little knowledge regarding mullerian adenosarcoma and its metastasizing pattern. Our objective was to evaluate the impact on the prognostic of the patient brought by tumor metastasizing to the retroperitoneum, to analyze the particularities of the treatment in such cases and to bring a significant change in the early therapeutic attitude to mullerian adenosarcomas. We present a first case report of a hypervascularized retroperitoneal metastasis from an initial low-grade uterine adenosarcoma. The presence of such a metastasis brought the worst prognostic factor to the patient. We consider that in front of a macroscopic polypoid mass there should be an active change in the diagnosis and in the therapeutic attitude. The frequent confusion between similar histopathological entities with different aggressiveness states and specific treatment responses, the poor outcome at advanced tumor stages, frequently in young patients, should trigger a universal remodeling in approaching these tumors. ","1215":"One of the most important factors is the technical and scientifically rapid development that is continually modifying the world we live in and polluting it with electromagnetic radiations. A functional and structural influence of magnetic and electromagnetic field on living organisms is presented in the literature by many performed experiments. The notion of bio-field represents the electromagnetic field generated by the bio-structures, not only in their normal physiological activities but also in their pathological states. There is a tight interdependency between the bio-field and the bio-structure, which respects the primary notion of an electromagnetic field given by the Maxwell-Faraday laws, in which, the electromagnetic phenomena are simplified to the field variations. These variations can be expressed in a coherent differential equation system that bounds the field vectors to different space points at different time moments. The living organisms cannot contain electrostatic and magneto-static fields due to the intense activity of the bio-structures. The biochemical reactions that have high rhythms and speeds always impose the electrodynamics character of the biologic field that also corresponds to the stability of the protein molecule that can be explained only through a dynamic way. The existent energy is not considered an exciting agent, and it does not lead to any effects. The parameters of these elementary bio-fields cannot yet be fully known due to technical reasons. The biological structures are very complex ones and undergo continuous dynamical activity. That is why the calculus model should be related to the constant dynamics, nowadays being very difficult to express.

In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate our initial experience concerning the bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) performed in patients with secondary BNS and to assess the efficiency, safety and short-term postoperative results of this approach. Between May 2009 and May 2010, a total of 30 male patients with BNS underwent BPV and were followed for a period of 6 months. BNS was secondary to monopolar transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) in 19 cases, to open surgery for BPH (open prostatectomy) in 8 cases and to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in 3 cases. The follow-up protocol included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life score (QoL), maximum flow rate (Qmax) and post-voiding residual urinary volume (RV) evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. BPV was successfully performed in all cases. All patients were able to void spontaneously and were continent after catheter removal. The mean operating time was 9 minutes, the mean catheterization period was 18 hours and the mean hospital stay was 24 hours. Preoperatively and at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery, the mean values for Qmax and RV were 7.2 ml\/s and 110 ml, 23.9 ml\/s and 20 ml, 23.8 ml\/s and 28 ml, and 23.4 ml\/s and 26 ml, respectively. Before surgery and at 1, 3 and 6 months, the IPSS and QoL scores were 22.6 and 4.1, 3.4 and 1.2, 3.6 and 1.4, and 3.7 and 1.4, respectively. BPV represents a valuable endoscopic treatment alternative for secondary BNS with good efficacy, reduced morbidity, fast postoperative recovery and satisfactory follow-up parameters. ","1220":"Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is a form of partial idiopathic epilepsy according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) syndromes classification (1989). Recent studies have identified cases of BRE that do not meet the initial definition of 'benign'; these included reports of cases with specific cognitive deficits. It is still a matter of debate, whether these deficits are due to epilepsy per se, to treatment or other associated factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate if BRE children have cognitive deficits at the onset of their seizures, prior to their participation in any anti-epileptic drug therapy (AED). We performed a neuropsychological assessment of 18 BRE children compared with a corresponding age-matched control group. We used the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Subjects were at their first neurological evaluation, before any AED therapy. We assessed: visual memory, induction and executive functions. In our group, the BRE children performed comparably with the control children for the induction and executive functions. Substantial differences were identified for the visual memory subtests: PRM percent correct (t = -2.58, p = 0.01) and SRM percent correct (t = -2.73, p = 0.01). Age of seizure onset had a negative impact on the visual memory subtest performances (PRM mean correct latency). We found significant correlations between the different CANTAB subtests results and characteristics of the centrotemporal spikes (CTS). Our results are consistent with the findings of other similar studies. This form of epilepsy is associated with subtle neuropsychological deficits, present at seizure onset. Neuropsychological deficits identified, suggest a more diffuse brain involvement in the epileptiform process. ","1221":"Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle (LV) is a rare disorder, classified as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association. The European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases classified LV noncompaction as an unclassified cardiomyopathy. LV noncompaction cardiomyopathy characterized by the following features: 1) an altered myocardial wall with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers, consisting of compacted and noncompacted myocardium and 2) continuity between the left ventricular cavity and the deep intertrabecular recesses, which are filled with blood from the ventricular cavity, without evidence of communication with the epicardial coronary artery system. Features of LV noncompaction can overlap with dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (especially the apical variant), and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The phenotypic expression can vary considerably within the same family. The LV noncompaction can rarely occur as a transient phenomenon during myocarditis. We present the case of a 23-year-old patient, admitted to our Department for cardiac evaluation because of ECG changes and cardiac enlargement revealed at thoracic radiography. She had a history of chronic toxoplasmosis. An echocardiography was performed revealing left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, diffuse hypokinesia and signs of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Under these circumstances, we have considered the presence of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. A cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed and it sustained the diagnosis. The alternative cause of isolated left ventricular noncompaction (prominent trabeculation due to myocardial toxoplasmosis) was considered improbable.","1222":"The major objective of treatment in glaucomatous disease is the decrease of intraocular pressure while maintaining the patient's vision and quality of life. Despite therapeutic possibilities, some cases of glaucoma remain refractory to treatment with the maintenance of elevated intraocular pressure and further progression of the disease.Artificial drainage systems, Ahmed valve, is a treatment alternative for refractory glaucoma when medical therapy, laser or conventional surgery have shown no results. We present the case of a patient presenting with refractive to medical treatment secondary glaucoma, following cataract surgery and vitrectomy for retinal detachment. One of the complications of vitreoretinal surgery is secondary glaucoma. Some of the patients with this type of glaucoma are unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. In such situations, a DPS implantation is needed such as an Ahmed valve in our case. There are situations in which classical surgery-trabeculectomy--has no theoretical chance of success (in cases of neovascular glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and inflammatory glaucoma post vitreoretinal surgery), [5,6]. Even though ASD are only used for refractory glaucoma, in this type of glaucoma, ADS can be used successfully as first line surgery. ","1223":"Trigger digit in children is rare. Triggering predominantly occurs in thumbs presenting a flexion deformity of interphalangeal joint of finger. In children, the disease usually presents with a remained finger in locked flexion, unlike the adults in whom triggering is more prevalent. The pathology of the disease includes locking of the tendon over A1 pulley. Some treatment modalities have been suggested to cure the trigger thumb, such as conservative therapy without any invasive approach, and surgery. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report about casting as a treatment method for trigger finger in children. Herein, we report three cases of patients with trigger finger, who were treated by using long arm casting.","1224":"About 95% of prostate cancers are adenocarcinoamas. Depending on the detection method used, neuroendocrine cells are found in 10% to 100% of prostate cancer specimens. A 64-year-old patient was diagnosed in 2006 with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, PSA 4.1 ng\/ml, Gleason 6, T3b, positive PSA immunohistochemistry. The patient was started on hormone therapy: orchidectomy followed by flutamide 750 mg\/day for three years, and underwent radiotherapy 6400 R. The patient was asymptomatic for three years. In 2009, the patient complained of perineal and rectal pain, but the PSA remained normal. In 2010, the patient underwent TUR of the prostate for acute urinary retention. Pathological exam revealed Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate (different pathologist suggested Gleason 9) and foci of neuroendocrine cells. Immunohistochemistry detected 15-20% positivity for Cromogranin A and 10% for synaptophysin. The patient developed multiple liver metastases in October 2010 and underwent five cycles of etoposide, carboplatin. The patient died of liver failure in March 2011. Regarding prevalence, neuroendocrine differentiation is the second phenotype after prostate adenocarcinoma, but still remains undiagnosed. It is resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Detection of the neuroendocrine differentiation is recommended during the clinical, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical follow up of prostate cancer patients treated by EBRT and \/ or androgen deprivation.

The etiology remains controversial, although most of the theories are linked to structural or functional abnormalities of the crico-pharyngeal muscle. With the therapeutic attitude varying from conservative to surgical (with associated morbidity and mortality), the importance of knowing the etiopathology and clinical implications of the disease for establishing the management of the case is mandatory. The aim of the study is the reevaluation of the methods and therapeutic principles in pharyngo-esophageal diverticular disease, starting from the etio pathogeny. Our study group is made up of 11 patients with surgical indication for Zenker diverticulum, operated between 2001 and 2011. During that period, more patients were diagnosed with this pathology, but the surgical indication was carefully established, in conformity with the actual practice guides, which involve the evaluation of the clinical manifestations determined by the diverticulum, as well as the identification and interception of the pathological mechanisms by the therapeutic gesture. Although it has a \"benign\" pathology, the esophageal diverticulum requires complex surgical procedure that implies significant morbidity.

The patients of Groups 2,3 and 4 were submitted to abdominal radiography during the pain episode. The sign of faecal loading in the cecum, characterized by hypo transparency interspersed with multiple small foci of hyper transparent images, was present in 97 patients of Subgroup 1A, in 68 patients of Subgroup 1B, in 19 patients of Group 2, in 12 patients of Group 3 and in 13 patients of Group 4. During the postoperative period the radiographic sign disappeared in 66 of the 68 cases that had presented with the sign. The sensitivity of the radiographic sign for acute appendicitis was 97.05% and its specificity was 85.33%. The positive predictive value for acute appendicitis was 78.94% and its negative predictive value was 98. 08%. The radiographic image of faecal loading in the cecum is associated with acute appendicitis and disappears after appendectomy.

Few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to this new phenomenon in the drug field, but methodological difficulties to detect them are considerable. Nonetheless, the importance of identifying potential new threats is widely recognized. The European Union's Early-Warning System (EWS) provides a quick-response mechanism to the emergence of new psychoactive substances on the drug scene. The European Council's decision on new psychoactive substances establishes a mechanism for the rapid exchange of information on new drugs. It also provides the possibility to trigger a formal risk assessment process, the findings of which may lead to a political decision to place new substances under control across the European Union.","1230":null,"1231":"Oxidative stress in utero-placental tissues plays an important role in the development of placental-related diseases. Maternal hiperhomocysteinemia is associated with placental mediated diseases, such as preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion and placental abruption. The aim of our study is to appreciate the clinical usefulness of the dosage serum homocysteine and malondialdehyde, as an oxidative stress marker, in the pregnancies complicated with risk of abortion or preterm birth. The study was performed at the Obstetric Gynecology Clinical Hospital Oradea from December 2009 until April 2010. It included 18 patients with risk of abortion (group 1), 22 with preterm birth (group 2). The results were compared with a control group composed by 14 healthy pregnant women. Serum homocysteine level was measured by an enzymatic method, on the instrument Hitachi 912, Roche, reagent: Axis-Shield Enzymatic. For proving the oxidative stress we established the level of malondialdehyde using a method with thiobarbituric acid TBA (Kei Satoh 1978) and the level of ceruloplasmin with the Ravin method .Also AST, ALT,CRP, iron, uric acid, urea were assessed.High level of homocysteine in both groups of study in comparison with the control group was found. The concentration of MDA was significantly higher in pregnancies complicated with risk of abortion and preterm birth compared to the control group (p=0.040, p=0.031). Considerable differences of ceruloplasmin concentration between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.045), and between group 2 and control group (p=0.034), was noticed but not any important differences between group 1 and control group (p=0.683).

The majority of the contributing factors and causes in the etiology of these diseases are reduced or treated with ozone in all its application forms (gas, water, oil). The beneficial biological effects of ozone, its anti-microbial activity, oxidation of bio-molecules precursors and microbial toxins implicated in periodontal diseases and its healing and tissue regeneration properties, make the use of ozone well indicated in all stages of gingival and periodontal diseases. The primary objective of this article is to provide a general review about the clinical applications of ozone in periodontics. The secondary objective is to summarize the available in vitro and in vivo studies in Periodontics in which ozone has been used. This objective would be of importance to future researchers in terms of what has been tried and what the potentials are for the clinical application of ozone in Periodontics.","1233":"The risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) prompted the evolution toward preservation of the injured spleen. Nonoperative management (NOM) of blunt injury to the spleen in adults has become the standard of care in hemodynamically stable patients. This modality of treatment began in the 1970's in paediatric patients. It is highly successful with overall failures rates from 2% to 31% (average 10.8%)--with the majority of failures occurring in the first 24 hours. Current, NOM of splenic trauma includes splenic artery embolization.However, the criteria for NOM are controversial. In this study we present the current criteria, the evolution and failure rates of this type of management viewed through the general knowledge and, particularly, our experience.","1234":"Continuous murmur is a peculiarity of cardiovascular auscultation, relatively rare, which often hides complex cardiovascular diseases.

The endoscopic treatment was introduced with promising results in selected cases. The purpose of this study was the retrospective analysis of the factors that can influence the prognosis of the patients with UUT-UCCs who underwent endoscopic treatment. We identified 187 patients who where diagnosed and treated for UUT-UCCs, between 1998 - 2011, in the Urology Department of \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Hospital, Bucharest. The endoscopic treatment was used in 65 cases. The indications for endoscopic treatment were imperative (41 cases) or elective (24 cases). The retrograde approach (rigid or flexible) was used in 47 cases, while the anterograde approach was preferred in 18 cases. Tumor ablation was performed using electroresection or Nd:YAG laser. The mean follow-up period was 60 months (range between 6 and 120 months). The follow-up protocol included computed tomography or intravenous urography, urinary cytology (selected cases), cystoscopy and ureteroscopy. The recurrence rates were reviewed by retrospective analysis. During follow-up 31 patients (47.6%) presented upper urinary tract recurrence. In 20 cases (30.7%) bladder recurrence was present. The median time from diagnosis to first recurrence was of 12.6 months. 18 patients (27.69%) underwent subsequent nephroureterectomy. The survival rates without recurrence at 1, 3 and 5 years were 61% (40 patients), 55.3% (36 patients) and 52.3% (34 patients). The most significant prognostic factors were: history of bladder tumour, tumour location and size, tumour stage and grade. The recurrence rate for pyelocaliceal tumours was 53.84% (21 out of 39 cases) and only 45.45% (10 out of 26 cases) for ureteral tumours. The recurrence rate for low-grade tumours was 36,36% (16 out of 44 cases) and 71.42% (15 out of 21 cases) for high-grade tumours. The tumours over 1.5 cm were associated with a higher recurrence rate compared with tumours below 1.5 cm (64.2 versus 43.13%). Endoscopic management of UUT-UCCs offers the advantage of preserving of renal function. Laser treatment of malignant urothelial lesions in the upper urinary tract should be reserved for a selected patient. The most important prognostic factors for UUT-UCCs evolution are tumours location, size and mostly tumour grade. The patients' compliance is very important for detecting recurrences.

Assuring a preventive treatment of the mother might solve this problem. To demonstrate breast milk iron content from disadvantaged mothers and impact of personalized iron supplementation program. cross-sectional study. Breast milk samples were obtained for ferritin analysis. Health's services usually provides free folic acid and iron treatment however, treatment compliance is low. Patients were random in two groups: \"A: Controls\" that had free iron tablets available from Health Centre; and \"B: Intervention\" group where patients accepted to be periodically contacted at home by health's team for personalized iron dispensation. 360 patients were included. Profilaxis and treatment compliance were 100% and 97,6% for B group while for \"Control\" one was 63% and 34%(p0.0001). Higher breast milk iron levels were detected in Intervention's mothers compared with control's patients (p0.007). Personalized iron prophylaxis and treatment increased breast milk iron levels.

To objectively assess whether there are significant differences regarding some specific key biological and psychometric parameters related to the use of hydrophilic catheters vs. non-hydrophilic ones. We have evaluated the outcomes of long term IC using by comparatively using the afore-mentioned two different types of catheters, on two lots (totally 45 patients with mainly retention type of neurogenic bladder): 30 post SCI patients, using exclusively hydrophilic catheters and respectively, 10 same kinds of patients that used exclusively non-hydrophilic catheters. Additionally, there were 5 patients included in both lots as they have started IC with non-hydrophilic catheters and since 2008 they have switched on using hydrophilic ones. The methods used were primary data acquisition based on a unitary questionnaire and statistical analyses. Mainly: the patients that used exclusively hydrophilic type of catheters (median: \"None\") vs. those using exclusively non-hydrophilic type of catheters (median: \"One every 4 months\") presented: a significantly lower number of inflammatory episodes at scrotal level (p-value: 0.0001 WT), a significantly lower number of post\/intra\/inter catheterization bleeding episodes (p-value: 0.0001 WT), a very slightly lower number of UTI activations and expressed a significant higher satisfaction level (p-value &lt;0.0001 WT). However, speculating a conceptual relation with the lower number of inflammatory episodes at scrotal level, it is to be thought that bigger lots of patients could provide, in this respect, significant results too. This study is to be continued, in order to further validate these preliminary, quite promising results, on bigger lots through the complex\/ rigorous assessment methodology already used.

One of the most important reasons of an obvious gap between medical education and professional expectations (outcomes) encountered by recent medical graduates is due to applying conventional curricula, which rely on hypothetical-deductive reasoning model. The University of Calgary has implemented a new curriculum which is organized according to 125 ways in which patients may present to a physician. In this study we will present our first experience in scheme development based on CPC philosophy in Iran. In 2007, research and clinical center for infertility (Yazd University of medical sciences, IRAN), began developing a full module for infertility (lesson plan) with fourteen components based on the new curricular philosophy. We recruited a scheme of infertility according to a specific way. Thus, at the first step of the module creation, a scheme was made as the most important mainstay of presentation module, i.e. a structured scheme that includes all causative diseases of infertility. Any effort in the organization of knowledge around schemes including in the domain of infertility would be valuable to meet some of the standards of WFME. Also, development of modules, by the teams composed of experts and students, can improve the quality of medical education. ","1239":"In 2002, Bryan Jennett chose the caption \"A syndrome in search of a name\" for the first chapter of his book \"The vegetative state--medical facts, ethical and legal dilemmas\", which, in summary, can be taken as his legacy. Jennett coined the term \"VegetativeState\" (VS), which became the preferential name for the syndrome of wakeful unresponsiveness in the English literature, with the intention to specify the concern and dilemmas in connection with the naming \"vegetative\", \"persistent\" and \"permanent\". In Europe, Apallic Syndrome (AS) is still in use. The prevalence of VS\/AS in hospital settings in Europe is 0.5-2\/100.000 population year; one-third traumatic brain damage, 70% following intracranial haemorrhages, tumours, cerebral hypoxemia after cardiac arrest, and end stage of certain progressive neurological diseases. VS\/AS reflects brain pathology of (a) consciousness, self-awareness, (b) behaviour, and (c) certain brain structures, so that patients are awake but total unresponsive. The ambiguity of the naming \"vegetative\" (meant to refer to the preserved vegetative (autonomous nervous system) can suggest that the patient is no more a human but \"vegetable\" like. And \"apallic\" does not mean being definitively and completely anatomically disconnected from neocortical structures. In 2009, having joined the International Task Force on the Vegetative State, we proposed the new term \"Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome\" (UWS) to enable (neuro-)scientists, the medical community, and the public to assess and define all stages accurately in a human way. The Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) could replace the VS\/AS nomenclature in science and public with social competence.","1240":"","1241":"This work describes a series of patients with odontogenic orbital cellulitis (OOC), focusing on rate of abscess formation, need for surgical intervention, and imaging findings helpful for rapid diagnosis. Review of a current case and 22 patients with OOC from the scientific literature demonstrated periapical lucency as the most commonly (36.4%) reported finding on facial and orbital computerized tomography (CT) scan. Orbital abscess occurred in 72.7% of cases, and tooth extraction and\/or abscess drainage was required in 95.5% of cases reviewed for control of infection. The current case presented with periapical lucency on CT scan, developed orbital abscess despite broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, and required multiple surgical interventions for disease resolution. Though our patient regained excellent vision, OOC often can result in severe vision loss. Periapical lucency on CT can help identify this atypical origin of cellulitis that is strongly associated with abscess formation and need for surgical intervention.","1242":"Women with increased mammographic density (MD) have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

Acquired tumors appear more frequently as a late complication of lumbar punctures (40%). The authors present three cases of epidermoid cysts of the cauda equina which were surgically treated in their department during the past five years. All three had suffered lumbar punctures for rachianesthesia 6-9 years prior to their presentation. The patients' ages ranged between 19 and 31. Surgical treatment was deemed necessary because of the space-occupying nature of this slow-growing lesion, and this indication was supported by the MRI findings. Two-level laminectomy and microsurgical total tumor ablation were performed in all three cases. There were no postoperative complications.","1244":"We will present the case of a 52 year old patient, admitted to our Department for exertional angina, with 2 recent acute events--inferior myocardial infarction and stroke. The coronary angiography revealed patent coronary arteries, without atherosclerotic lesions. The transthoracic echocardiography established the presence of an interatrial septal aneurysm with interatrial shunt. Under these circumstances, we have considered the presence of paradoxical embolism as a potential pathophysiological mechanism of the acute ischemic events. The percutaneous closure of the interatrial shunt to prevent the recurrence of embolic events will be discussed.","1245":"Hybrid leukemia is a clinical entity that includes: biphenotypic leukemia, characterized by the presence of markers of more than two lineages of a single tumor cell, bilineage leukemia, a combination of more than two lineage markers on two distinct blast cells, and biclonal leukemia, the concomitancy of more than two types of leukemic cells, derived from different clonal expansions. We present a case of a 7-year-old female diagnosed with bilineage leukemia. We propose a treatment for biphenotypic\/bilineage leukemia in the cases with good prognostic factors.

She had right-sided paresia after an inguinal hernia operation when she was one and a half years old. On neurological examination she was speaking fluently, and cooperated on complicated comments. Motor examination revealed right-sided spastic hemiparesis predominant on distal parts and right sided visual field defect. But she was continuing her activity of daily livings without help. Her detailed neuropsycological examination revealed mild cognitive dysfunction. Cranial MRI showed total left hemisphere encephalomalasia. Right hemisphere function was noticed on task-related brain activation during voluntary movement of her right leg (she was not capable of performing right hand function tasks by herself ) on functional MRI. Cerebral lesions in the early life can be compensated with the unaffected hemisphere by the neuronal reorganisation and a patient with complete left hemisphere lesion such as our patient can speak, maintain her life without assistance but with mild cognitive decline, compared with elderly stroke patients.

There are novel insights regarding heart failure that provide a platform for personalized medicine. This is a review of the existent data about heart failure in women, a neglected topic that has gained considerable interest in the past years. Heart failure in women differs in many aspects from that of men. Part of the difference is attributable to age, ventricular function and cause of heart failure, with women being generally older at heart failure onset, more often without left ventricular systolic dysfunction and less often having heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease, in comparison with men. Elucidation of the genetic and pathophysiological basis of sex differences, together with clinical trials designed to study the impact of treatments in women, could lead to sex based heart failure management.","1250":"Treatment of stress urinary incontinence consists of a wide range of options, from conservative therapies like lifestyle changes, medication, pelvic floor muscles exercises, electro-stimulation, to minimally invasive procedures--injection of collagen, suburethral slings TVT\/TOT and last but not least, invasive surgical treatment reserved for recurrent and complex cases. Among the latest minimally invasive procedures reported in literature, the injection of intra-and perisphincterian of autologous stem cell (mioblasts and\/or mature fibroblasts grown and multiplied in the laboratory from biopsy samples taken from the pectoralis muscles).

Hepatitis viruses are hepatotrope viruses, potentially lymphotrope and also potentially oncogenic (hepatocellular carcinoma) viruses. HBV and HCV are involved in autoimmune disorders and in the ethiopathogeny of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. Detection of immunophenotype changes of malignant lymphocytes in CLD--especially CLL--associated with hepatitis viral infections. Bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood samples on EDTA were available for analysis from 58 patients from a follow-up schedule of the Department of Hematology SUUB from March 2008 until June 2009. The patients were diagnosed with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders associated with hepatitis virus B\/C\/D infections. A group of 28 consecutive unselected patients with CLL who met the diagnostic criteria of the National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI NCIWG), and associated hepatitis viral infection (v-CLL) were studied for the expression of several immunophenotypical markers, in comparison to CLL patients without viral infection (control group). Immunophenotyping analysis was performed on a FACS Calibur flowcytometer with a large panel according to EGIL\/WHO recommendations. The diagnosis was completed after the histological and immunochemical analysis from tumoral lesions. Demographics characteristics--male\/female ratio 1\/2, average age 64 years. Disease type: 90% B-CLD, 5% T-CLD, 5% Hodgkin's disease. The viral infections: 58.53% HCV, 34.41% HBV, 2.43% HBV+HDV, 2.43% HCV+HDV, 2.43% HBV+HCV+HDV. We found in CLL with viral coinfection (v-CLL) cases an elevated expression of B-cell markers--CD19 (Md95\/92), CD20 (Md 90\/39), CD79b (Md58\/31), CD23 (Md67\/37). Poor prognosis markers have a higher expression in v-CLL: CD38 (Md49\/24), Bcl2 (Md 46\/5), cyclin D19 (Md 11\/0.5). No change in ZAP-70 expression was observed: Md 59.5\/59.1. Hepatitis viruses could be involved in the pathogenesis of CLD, but as a trigger for a more aggressive outcome. Higher expression of B-cell markers CD19, CD20 in CLL with viral infection suggests a change to atypical CLL, sustained by elevated expression of known poor prognosis markers bcl-2, cyclin D1 and CD38. Lack of ZAP-70 expression could be explained by a strong correlation with a basic unmutated IgVH status, not related to the viral infection. We found a higher frequency of HCV infection in patients with CLD and especially in CLL patients, which were analyzed extensively for immunophenotypical changes. In the present study, we demonstrated that this CD5+ B cell population with clonal expansion, defining CLL patients, has a different immunophenotype, probably related to the hepatitis viral infection.

These tests targeted to determine the viability and morphology of cells (fibroblasts) that were in indirect contact with the studied polymers. Cell viability achieved for all the studied synthetic polymers allowed their frame in biocompatible material category. Cell morphology did not significantly change, thus accomplishing a new biocompatibility criterion. The degree of biocompatibility of the studied polymers varied. Polyvinyl alcohol presented the highest grade of biocompatibility and polyvinyl chloride placed itself at the lowest limit of biocompatibility. The results achieved allowed the selection of those polymers that (by enhancing their degrees of biocompatibility due to the association with various biopolymers) will be used in the development of new biocompatible materials, useful in nervous conduits manufacture.","1255":"Even if the reactive oxygen species were discovered, described and detailed a long time ago, there is still little data about the mechanisms of oxidative stress, their tissular effects and about an efficient antioxidant strategy, involving animal experimental models. It has been shown that the lung is one of the most exposed organs to the oxidative stress. The particular effects of different types of oxidative stress on lungs were investigated in this experimental study, in order to quantify the intensity and the extent of the pulmonary damage, featuring the antioxidant enzymatic protective role. The study of lung injury was performed on four distinct groups of Wistar rats: a control group versus a group exposed to continuous light deprivation versus a group exposed to nitrofurantoin versus a group exposed to continuous light deprivation, to nitrofurantoin and vitamin C. Pulmonary samples were taken and treated for microscopic analysis. A qualitative immunohistochemical estimation of pulmonary superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) was performed. Blood tests were used in order to reveal the presence and intensity of oxidative stress. Continuous light deprivation and the chronic administration of nitrofurantoin acted as oxidants with a certain involvement in lung damage--vascular and alveolar wall disturbances. Adding an antioxidant, such as vitamin C, considerably improved lung reactivity to oxidative stress. The chronic exposure to oxidants in the induced oxidative stress sustains the development of specific lung alterations. SOD 1 positive reaction underlines the complex enzymatic defense in oxidative stress. ","1256":"Children 0-3 years old present a completely different neurotraumatic pathology.

We found 72 children with diastatic skull fracture, 61 cases with depressed ('ping-pong') skull fracture, 22 cases with grow skull fracture, 11 children harboring intrusive skull fracture, 58 cephalhematomas, 26 extradural hematomas, and 7 children with severe brain injury and major posttraumatic diffuse ischemia ('black-brain'). Usually, infants and toddlers present with seizures, pallor, and rapid loss of consciousness. First choice examination, in all children was cerebral CT-scan, and for follow-up, we performed cerebral MRI. We emphasize on the importance of seizure prevention in this age group. Children presenting with extensive diffuse ischemia ('black-brain') had a poor outcome, death occurring in all 7 cases. Children 0-3 years old, present with a total distinctive pathology than adults. Children with head injury must be addressed to a pediatric department of neurosurgery and pediatric intensive care unit. Prophylaxis pays the most important role in improving the outcome.

The identification of new common risk factors (computer use and contact lens wear) extends the disease among the young people. The early diagnosis of dry eye is essential, but difficult, because the biochemical changes in tear film usually occur before any detectable signs. Due its advantages, electrophoresis of tear proteins could be an important tool for diagnosis of tear film impairment in high risk groups for dry eye. The role of tear proteins electrophoresis in early diagnosis of dry eye related to computer use and contact lens wear, as well as the biochemical changes in these high risk groups are presented. This review will summarize the actual data concerning the electrophoretic changes of tear proteins in computer users and contact lens wearers, two common high risk groups for dry eye. Electrophoresis of tear proteins using automated system Hyrys-Hydrasys SEBIA France is an important tool for early diagnosis of tear film alterations and monitoring of therapy. The quantification of many proteins in a single analysis using a small quantity of unconcentrated reflex tears is the main advantage of this technique.

","1258":"The central nervous system can act as a compartment in which HIV can replicate independently from plasma, and also as a sanctuary in which, under suboptimal drug pressure, HIV antiretroviral genetic variants can occur. Continuous replication of HIV in brain can contribute to neurocognitive impairment. Therefore, reaching adequate concentrations of antiretrovirals in the central nervous system might be essential in providing neuroprotection and improving neurocognition. Antiretrovirals have a restricted entry into the brain, due to several factors: the unique structure of the blood-brain barrier, and the existence of efficient efflux mechanisms. However, there is a high variability of antiretrovirals in reaching therapeutic drug concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid, that depend on the characteristics of the antiretrovirals (molecular weight, lipophilicity, protein binding) and on their capacity to be substrate for efflux transporters. The review aims to discuss the main mechanisms that interfere with antiretroviral penetration into central nervous system, and to summarize the current data concerning the penetrability of different antiretrovirals into the cerebrospinal fluid.","1259":"Craniosynostoses are recognized as a group of birth defects that impair the skull structures by early closure of one or more sutures, causing an abnormal cranial shape. Among the \"simple\" craniosynostoses, (a single closed suture) the most common is scaphocephaly. The 3D CT scan is the most relevant and rapid diagnostic test. The authors present the personal experience of 98 scaphocephaly cases diagnosed and surgically treated in the Neurosurgical Department of \"Bagdasar-Arseni\" Emergency Hospital during a period of 10 years (2000 - 2009). The procedure of choice was the Stein &amp; Schut (1977) extensive craniotomy that removes the early closed suture. There were no post-operatory death cases and no abnormally closed sutures. The routine use of the craniotome facilitates the lateral osteotomy that allows a normal brain growth and a normal symmetrical skull shape development.

Alcohol seems to inhibit the immune system. Despite the extensive literature related to alcoholism, data related to the immune system are still not conclusive. The purpose of this study was to verify the influence of acute alcohol intake on colloid distribution in the organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Thirteen male Swiss mice were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 5) - control, and Group 2 (n = 8) - animals that received 0.5 ml ethanol 50%, 30 minutes before the experiment. Colloidal sulphur labeled with 99mTc was used to evaluate colloid distribution in the liver, spleen and lungs. Colloid clearance was assessed as well. A gamma camera was used to measure the radioactivity of these organs and of a blood clot. No difference was found in the presence of colloid in the organs of both groups. The liver showed the highest phagocytic intake, followed by the spleen and lungs (p = 0.021 for Group 1 and p = 0.003 for Group 2). A minimum amount of radiation remained in the blood of both groups. According to the experiential conditions of this work, acute ingestion of alcohol did not interfere with the phagocytic function of the mononuclear phagocyte system in mice.

The differentiation between myxomas and thrombi is sometimes difficult, but is critical in making the right therapeutical decision. A 70-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with palpitations, dyspnea and anterior epistaxis. She had a 3 years history of atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure NYHA class III. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the thickening of the mitral valves with moderate mitral insufficiency and a mobile round mass in the left atrium, heterogeneous, inhomogeneous, 18 mm in size, attached with a narrow stalk to the interatrial septum, reaching mitral annular plane; tricuspid insufficiency with a maximum 30 mmHg gradient, intact interatrial septum, akinesia of two thirds of basal inferior wall, 42% ejection fraction. The two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the intraatrial mass. Epistaxis was considered to be due to heart failure and the increased venous pressure. The patient was referred to the cardiovascular surgery clinic, but refused surgery. Anticoagulation with fraxiparine 0,6 ml\/day was started and continued for 3 weeks, after cessation of epistaxis by nasal tamponament. Then echocardiography was repeated, with no remnant mass in the left atrium. The conclusion was that the mass must have been a thrombus that has melted away. In this particular case, the left intraatrial thrombus may have been due to the presence of atrial fibrillation.

There are many causes that lead to tinnitus in elderly population, including otology, metabolic, neurologic or cardiovascular conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the association of tinnitus with these chronic comorbidities among elderly community and its impact upon their quality of life. We performed a clinical retrospective study on 471 ENT patients hospitalized for various diseases, up to 60 years old, for a period of 24 months. All subjects were assessed for subjective tinnitus, neuro-vascular comorbidities and QoL by use of the brief version of the World Health Organization QoL instrument. Tinnitus was reported in 114 patients, giving a prevalence of 24,2%. Variables like gender, residence, economic status, alcohol or smoking were not significantly associated with tinnitus. On the other hand, otic and sinonasal pathology, dizziness, hypertension, arteriosclerosis or diabetes were significantly correlated. All patients with tinnitus presented a more negative perception of their overall health and a poorer QoL, compared to those without. Tinnitus is a common pathology among elderly community. Its association with chronic treatable health comorbidities reduces QoL and highlights the need of cooping strategies among this group population.

Although its prognosis has improved over the last several decades, it still carries substantial mortality. Although most portal hypertensive bleeds result from the ruptured distal esophageal varices, bleeding from other sources such gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and ectopic varices can lead to clinically significant bleeding. Variceal bleeding typically presents as massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with hematemesis, melena or hematochezia. In general, the terapeutic aims of management are to initially correct hypovolemia, to control bleeding, to prevent complications of bleeding, such as infection and renal failure and to prevent early rebleeding. The treatment of bleeding esophageal varices differs substantially foom the treatment of other lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, patients with esophageal varices typically have severe liver disease and thus are likely from poor nutrition, blood clotting disorders, and encephalopathy, all of which can adversaly affect morbidity and mortality.","1267":"Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. The etiology is clearly bacterial and a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythus and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Comparatively, little attention has been paid to the identification of health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the gingival sulcus. Probiotic technology represents a breakthrough approach to maintaining oral health by using natural beneficial bacteria, commonly found in healthy mouths, to provide a natural defense against those bacteria which are thought to be harmful to teeth and gums. This article endeavors to introduce the concepts of probiotics in periodontics.","1268":"The prevalence and impact of cardiovascular diseases in the world are growing. There are 2 million deaths due to cardiovascular disease each year in the European Union; the main cause of death being the coronary heart disease responsible for 16% of deaths in men and 15% in women. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Romania is estimated at 7 million people, of which 2.8 million have ischemic heart disease. In this epidemiological context, risk stratification is required for individualization of therapeutic strategies for each patient. The continuing evolution of the diagnosis and treatment techniques combines personalized medicine with the trend of therapeutic management leveling, based on guidelines and consensus, which are in constant update. The guidelines used in clinical practice have involved risk stratification and identification of patient groups in whom the risk-benefit ratio of using new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques has a positive value. Presence of several risk factors may indicate a more important total risk than the presence \/ significant increase from normal values of a single risk factor. Modern trends in risk stratification of patients with coronary heart disease are polarized between the use of simple data versus complex scores, traditional data versus new risk factors, generally valid scores versus personalized scores, depending on patient characteristics, type of coronary artery disease, with impact on the suggested therapy. All known information and techniques can be integrated in a complex system of risk assessment. The current trend in risk assessment is to identify coronary artery disease in early forms, before clinical manifestation, and to guide therapy, particularly in patients with intermediate risk, which can be classified in another class of risk based on new obtained information.","1269":null,"1270":"Perforation of the gall bladder with cholecystohepatic communication is a rare cause of liver abscess. We are reporting here six rare cases of gall bladder perforation with variable clinical presentations. Most patients presented with right hypochondrium pain and fever but two patients presented with only pain in the abdomen. Ultrasonography (USG) and Computed Tomography (CT) were used for diagnosis. The patients were also successfully treated. There was a gall bladder perforation with cholecystohepatic communication, leading to liver abscess formation in most cases on USG and CT. The final diagnosis was confirmed on surgery. The perforation of the gall bladder which leads to liver abscess is a rare complication of acute, chronic or empyema gall bladder. USG and CT scans are the most important diagnostic tool in diagnosing this rare complication. In the set up, where advanced options are not available, the only treatment of choice is the conservative one or surgery, according to the status of the patients. ","1271":"To further evaluate the adequacy of the items in our questionnaire aimed at unraveling the possible correlations between psychological features and internal disorders. This paper is dedicated to the items exploring the individual's interaction with other people. The items are divided into several subdomains. For each subdomain, we have calculated the correlations between the items of the respective subdomain (inner associations) and with the items in other subdomains (outer associations) by means of chi square test or Fisher exact test as dictated by statistical reasons. We examined the answers from our first 10192 respondents. Many inter-item correlations are the consequence of higher or lesser degrees of synonymy. Those within a given subdomain confirm the adequate allocation of items. Those bridging different subdomains may point either to incorrect assignments, or to semantic inclusion relations. Other results are not explicable by semantic similarity, and probably reveal psychological subtleties, such as: most individuals have a sense of undeservedness when badly treated by other people; those easily hurt by insults and humiliations have a propensity to timidity and\/or emotivity; the subjects who shun conflicts are more prone to persistent thoughts, brooding people are more sensitive and more prone to conflicts, injustice-indignant people frequently get into conflict although they declare to be bothered by dissent etc. But at the heart of all the PFs in the Interaction-with-other-people domain there seems to be the sense of being undervalued, which should probably be the key issue to be addressed by any therapeutic interventions for diseases psychoemotionally determined by disturbed interpersonal relationships.

Both dietary and pharmacological manipulations of redox metabolism have been associated with the extension of lifespan. Increasing new evidence s also suggests that the process of aging may derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged material. The accumulation of this molecular \"garbage\", relatively indigestible, further hinders cellular functions, induces progressive failure of maintenance and repair and increases the probability of death. One important trend in anti-aging strategy is, therefore, to prevent or even revert the accumulation of these oxidatively altered molecules by stimulating the maintenance and repair systems through hormesis. A promising approach for slowing down ageing and achieving a healthy senescence is represented by repeated exposure to various mild stresses (caloric restriction, moderate exercise, nutritional or pharmacological hormetins). This article reviews the potential therapeutic tools available to date for increasing longevity and obtaining and successful ageing from the redox and hormetic perspective.","1274":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a prime player in the clinical and preclinical detection of ischemic heart disease (IHD) as well in the prognosis assessment by offering a comprehensive approach for all spectrums of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The aim of this review is to provide the reader a state-of-the art on how the newest cardiac MRI techniques can be used to study IHD patients. In patients with suspected\/stable CAD, functional and perfusion imaging both at rest and during vasodilatatory stress (adenosine, dypiridamole)\/dobutamine stress can accurately depict ischemic myocardium secondary to significant coronary artery stenosis. In patients with acute MI, MRI is a robust tool for differentiating and sizing the jeopardized and the infarcted myocardium by using a combination of functional, edema, perfusion and Gd contrast imaging. Moreover, important prognostic factors like myocardial salvage, the presence of microvascular obstruction (MVO), post reperfusion myocardial hemorrhage, RV involvement and infarct related complications can be assessed in the same examination. In patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, the role of the MRI extends from diagnosis by means of Gadolinium contrast scar imaging to therapy and prognosis by functional assessment and viability testing with rest and dobutamine stress imaging. In all the circumstances mentioned, MRI derived information has been proven valuable in every day clinical decision making and prognosis assessment. Thus, MRI is becoming more and more an accepted alternative to other imaging modalities both in the acute and chronic setting.","1275":"Due to an ever-aging population and a growing prevalence of osteoporosis and motor vehicle accidents, the number of subtrochanteric fractures is increasing worldwide. The choice of the appropriate implant continues to be critical for fixation of unstable hip fractures. The subtrochanteric region has certain anatomical and biomechanical features that can make fractures in this region difficult to treat. The preferred type of device is a matter of debate. Increased understandings of biomechanical characteristics of the hip and improvement of the implant materials have reduced the incidence of complications. The surgeons choose between the two methods according to Seinsheimer's classification and also to their personal preferences. As a general principle, the open reduction and internal fixation were performed in stable fractures, and the closed reduction and internal fixation were performed in unstable fractures. The advantages of intramedullary nailing consist in a small skin incision, lower operating times, preservation of fracture hematoma and the possibility of early weight bearing. The disadvantages consist in a difficult closed reduction due to important muscular forces, although the nail can be used as a reduction instrument, and higher implant cost. In open reduction internal fixation techniques, the advantage is represented by anatomical reduction which, in our opinion, is not necessary. The disadvantages are represented by: higher operating time, demanding surgery, large devascularization, higher infection rates, late weight bearing, medial instability, refracture after plate removal and inesthetic approach.","1276":"Stress urinary incontinence is still a \"battlefield\" for many minimally invasive therapies, but, unfortunately, few can restore the anatomical and functional background of this disorder.

The first stem cell implantation (myoblasts and \/or mature fibroblasts grown and multiplied in the laboratory from biopsy samples taken from the pectoralis muscle) in the urethral sphincter was performed on October 18, 2010, in \"Fundeni\" Clinic of Urology and Renal Transplantation, in Romania. The follow-up at six weeks with the quality of life questionnaires, micturition diary and clinical examination revealed a decrease of urine loss from six pads\/ day at one per day, which significantly improved the patient's quality of life according to visual analogue scale. Clinical and urodynamic evaluations will continue and will be future scientific topics. ","1277":"Heart failure (HF) is a common, costly, disabling and deadly syndrome. Heart failure is a progressive disease characterized by high prevalence in society, significantly reducing physical and mental health, frequent hospitalization and high mortality (50% of the patients survive up to 4 years after the diagnosis, the annual mortality varying from 5% to 75%). The purpose of this study is to develop a prognostic model with easily obtainable variables for patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. Our lot included 101 non-consecutive hospitalized patients with heart failure diagnosis. It included 49.5% women having the average age of 71.23 years (starting from 40 up to 91 years old) and the roughly estimated period for monitoring was 35.1 months (5-65 months). Survival data were available for all patients and the median survival duration was of 44.0 months. A large number of variables (demographic, etiologic, co morbidity, clinical, echocardiograph, ECG, laboratory and medication) were evaluated. We performed a complex statistical analysis, studying: survival curve, cumulative hazard, hazard function, lifetime distribution and density function, meaning residual life time, Ln S (t) vs. t and Ln(H) t vs. Ln (t). The Cox multiple regression model was used in order to determine the major factors that allow the forecasting survival and their regression coefficients: age (0.0369), systolic blood pressure (-0.0219), potassium (0.0570), sex (-0.3124) and the acute myocardial infarction (0.2662). DISCUSSION. Our model easily incorporates obtainable variables that may be available in any hospital, accurately predicting survival of the heart failure patients and enables risk stratification in a few hours after the patients' presentation. Our model is derived from a sample of patients hospitalized in an emergency department of cardiology, some with major life-altering co morbidities. The benefit of being aware of the prognosis of these patients with high risk is extremely beneficial. The use of this model may ease the estimation of the vital prognosis, to improve the compliance and increase in the use of life-saving medical or surgical therapy (pacemakers, implantable defibrillators or transplantation).","1278":"Given the increasing life expectancy in the coming years, dental practitioners, as other specialists from different medical fields, will encounter an increasing number of complete edentulous patients. These patients, with a longer active life and higher standards of life quality, will have different expectations for their complete dentures, higher than the standard treatment that uses conventional complete dentures. Two-implant overdenture is considered the first alternative treatment in complete edentulous mandible, according to current medical standards established by a team of specialists in prosthodontics and implantology, and globally known as the McGill Consensus from McGill University, Montreal, Canada. The Consensus was established during a-day-and-a-half session of presentations done by experts who presented data, scientific information on the subject, and, not less significant, personal experiences of participants and patients. Overdenture on implants, as an alternative treatment for complete edentulous mandible, has multiple benefits in achieving better conditions of prosthesis: balance and effectiveness, with positive effects on oral structures, aesthetics, and quality of life. Mandibular two-implant overdenture, established as a standard treatment by the highest international forum, should gradually become the first choice of treatment in complete edentulous mandible.","1279":"The optimization of a diagnosis process and fluency in the Health Care sector in Romania. A key to discover this complex process was to determine a correlation between the physicians and the use of information technology, on one side and the patients' perspective on the other. Integrating information technology in a physician's activity will lead to lower costs and less time spent while diagnosing patients. Using the electronic medical records and introducing a unified database with the patients' medical histories will make the process of diagnosis easier. We studied the diagnosis from the point of view of 304 patients in a public hospital and 320 physicians working there. We believed that time and accessibility to different physicians makes the diagnosis process a burden for a patient and implicitly lead to dissatisfaction with health care services. We supposed that the burden of diagnosis for physicians comes from the lack of Internet connection and computer usage knowledge. We have found out that most physicians know how to use the computer at an intermediate level and have access to Internet, online journals and databases and do not use emails to a higher extent to communicate to other specialists, but do not rely entirely on the electronic medical records. Most physicians think that it is not technology, which stands in the way of proper and fast diagnosis but the financing and the paper work from the Romanian health system. Solutions that might be taken into account to entirely motivate physicians to use electronic medical records are: 1. Adjustments can be made to the computer software interface in order to make the design more consistent (to eliminate the paper forms) and user friendly. 2. Physicians can be provided with more training and knowledge. After some statistical tests have been applied to find a correlation between the chosen variables, we have reached the conclusion that the results are encouraging and there is no correlation between the degree of the impact of Preventive Medicine and the healthy behavior of the respondents.

We report the case of a 45 year-old women, diagnosed with severe coarctation of the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery, with poststenotic dilatation of the descending aorta and difficult control of blood pressure values. The patient was successfully treated interventionally, by balloon angioplasty with deployment of a covered stent.

We assessed the efficacy of the antiosteoporotic pharmacological therapy to improve bone quality and bone strength in postmenopausal women diagnosed with hip arthrosis and osteoporosis thus facilitating the hip surgical intervention. We evaluated 20 postmenopausal women aged between 53-60 years diagnosed with osteoporosis according to the WHO criteria, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for bone mineral density measurements. All these patients had low hip T score (osteopenia\/ osteoporosis) and also incipient hip arthrosis. The surgical approach was delayed for 12 months and all the patients received bisphosphonate therapy with calcium and vitamin D supplements. DXA scans were performed after 12 months of therapy in all the patients. A surgical intervention with resurfacing total hip replacement was performed in 12 of the 16 patients presenting with increasing BMD, 4 of them showing elements of rapidly advancing hip arthrosis to a stage that made this type of intervention impossible. We chose not to use this technique in the group with stable BMD (4 patients). All 12 women surgically treated had a favorable post-operative outcome without experiencing a femoral neck fracture during the surgical intervention or during the twelve-month follow-up. All 20 patients continued to receive bisphosphonate therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and associated hip arthrosis, improving bone mass and bone quality with bisphosphonate therapy is necessary and important in order to allow hip arthroplasty, by using the technique of resurfacing, avoiding the risk of intra-operative fractures and with a favorable post-operative long-term outcome. ","1285":"The aim of this study was to obtain four collagen based porous scaffolds and to assess their in vitro biocompatibility and biodegradability in order to use them for skin tissue engineering. We have prepared four variants of collagen-based biodegradable sponges by liophilization of type I collagen solution and three variants of collagen-agarose mixture in different ratios 2:1 (A), 1:1 (B) and 1:2 (C). These scaffolds had microporous structure with a higher than 98% porosity and a reduced biodegradation after their exposure to UV radiation. The incorporation of agarose into the collagen scaffolds has improved their structural stability. In vitro biocompatibility testing for the four types of sponges was performed on a stabilized fibroblast cell line and showed that both cell viability and morphology were not altered by collagen and collagen-agarose variants A and B sponges. These three porous sponges demonstrated potential for future application as cell scaffolds in skin tissue engineering.","1286":"Oral health is one of the fundamental steps to general health, well being and a determinant factor for the quality of life. Objective of this cross-sectional study is to assess the oral-systemic health and the treatment needs among the institutionalized people in a homeless center, with high prevalence of co-morbidities and barriers to care. After getting the informed consent, 51 adults from a community, which is disadvantaged from a socio-economic and medical point of view, were studied: frequently with multiple general diseases treated with medicines that produce oral side effects, a high need of treatment and the lack of a dental office. The subjects were orally examined from a clinical point of view and received a questionnaire with regard to the presence of the health risk factors. General health status and drug treatments of subjects were evaluated based on medical records. Results showed that oral health status of the subjects is precarious, oral hygiene is poor and the subjects are exposed to common risk factors for oral and systemic diseases: tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet, poor hygiene and history of cancer. If their needs are not met, the oral health will be persistently poor and will further deteriorate during their residency, because of increasing care dependency and subsequent lack of adequate oral health care. Despite great achievements in oral and general health of populations, problems still remain in many communities, particularly among underprivileged groups. ","1287":"The present study evaluated the effects on gestation, in terms of oxidative stress, of two antioxidant factors-vitamin E and coenzyme Q10-during pregnancy, with the purpose of applying the results in further human clinical practice. For each aspect we have studied, we used three types of female rats of Wistar race (un-pregnant, primiparous, multiparous), divided in 10 rats\/group. From the blood we have sampled, we have determined the oxidative stress (OS) markers: malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonylated proteins (CP), but also the markers of the antioxidant defense: the hydrogen donor capacity of the plasma (HD) and the sulfhydryl groups (SH). Vitamin E administration determines significant decreases of MDA and significant increases of CP and HD at primiparous, and also significant increases of SH groups at multiparous. In the case of pregnant animals that received CoQ10 in antioxidant complexes, we have observed an increase of oxidative stress (OS)-MDA in primiparous and CP in multiparous. In the case of Vitamin E, taking into account the benefits on redox homeostasis, the decrease of OS, the authors recommend vitamin E administration during pregnancy. However, because of the increase of the OS in the case of pregnant animals, the authors do not recommend the administration of CoQ(10) in antioxidant complexes during pregnancy. ","1288":"We performed this study with the purpose of revealing different aspects of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in peritonitis. The aim of the presentation was to make a research on some of the immune response mediators in secondary peritonitis and to observe their capacity to anticipate the evolution towards septic complications. We have undertaken a study on a group of 100 patients with acute diffuse peritonitis, between 2009 and 2011, in which we have accomplished the dosage of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha cytokines in the serum of patients, in dynamics, for 7 days by using the Elisa method. Subsequently, we have compared the results to the ones of a control group. The data obtained indicated high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the patients who subsequently suffered an unfavorable evolution towards septic complications. The study of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha blood dynamics, offers valuable information about the severity of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome in peritonitis. They can be valuable biomarkers in establishing the unfavorable evolution of patients, helping the physician to establish a sustained and specific treatment, even from the early phases of the illness. ","1289":"Drug resistance mutations are frequently detected in antiretroviral-naive HIV positive patients, however the data on transmitted resistance in non-B subtypes are limited. As HIV1 subtype F is prevalent in Romania, our goal is to analyze resistance mutations in the pol gene of HIV-1 isolates from drug-naive Romanian patients. HIV-1 pol gene from 12 untreated patients, newly diagnosed (n = 6) and chronically infected (n=6), with detectable HIV RNA viral load was genotyped and the viral subtype was determined by using the Stanford database algorithm. 8\/12 strains belonged to the F subtype, 1\/12 to the G subtype, and the rest of the studied strains appeared to be K\/F, A\/F and J\/F inter-subtype recombinant forms. The prevalence of HIV-1 strains with at least one major drug resistance mutation in the studied group was unexpectedly high. Major mutations associated with NRTI, NNRTI and PI resistance were detected in 6\/12 patients, 2\/12 patients and 3\/12 patients, respectively; in addition all viral strains had minor mutations in the protease gene. Newly diagnosed patients harbored resistant variants more often than chronically infected ones (4\/6 vs. 2\/6) did. These data support the use of genotypic resistance testing in treatment-naive HIV positive patients, in order to guide the selection of the first line of antiretrovirals, due to the fact that persons with transmitted drug resistance have a higher risk for both virologic failure and development of resistance at treatment initiation.","1290":"Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United States and it is the leading cause of disability. Early diagnosis and immediate therapeutic interventions are important factors to reduce the extent of brain tissue damage and the risk of stroke-related death. A rapid blood test that can confirm the clinical or imaging diagnosis or that can add to the stratification of the risk would be very useful. Such a test has to be validated in large studies and has to be based on a simple and low-cost technology. Many biological markers were tested for their ability to serve as 'would-be' stroke biological markers; some of them appear to have a place in the diagnostic work-up of stroke patients. These molecules include Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA), APO C-III, APO C-I, PARK7, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDKA), S100B, B-type neurotrophic growth factor, von Willebrand factor, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. There are obvious limitations to this study, among them the fact that disability does not necessarily correlate with the amount of cerebral tissue lost (the site of stroke may be more important) and the role of the blood-brain barrier in delaying the release of the neuronal proteins in the blood stream. Further studies are awaited to confirm the role of these molecules in the management of acute stroke patients.","1291":"The management of renal parenchymal tumors has known many changes over time, a trend that continues today, as a result of technological advances, clinical research and improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Unfortunately, conventional cancer treatments--chemotherapy and radiotherapy have proven ineffective and modern approaches such as immunotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, though they enjoyed an initial enthusiasm, subsequent studies have shown limited and controversial effects. Thus, surgery remains the gold standard therapy for this type of cancer. The options for the treatment of RCC are numerous, with options that have advantages and disadvantages, with oncological results, in most cases, positive at five years and with different impact on cancer specific survival. It is difficult to compare the results, as these are different techniques with various instruments and intraoperative steps, with more questionable inclusion criteria, selection biases and prosecution, with a tendency for preferential enrollment, different reasons to why randomized prospective studies have not been performed until today. This article is a review of the diagnosis and methods of treatment of small renal masses 2011. At the beginning of the new millennium, kidney cancer, with all the arsenal of techniques and methods of ablative surgery, remains a potentially fatal disease for a high percentage of patients, and the decision to choose a treatment or another should be taken with responsibility, depending on currently existing medical records, the degree of expertise and not based on subjective or other non-standard parameters. ","1292":"This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of neuronal T-type calcium channel regulation as well as their physiological and pathophysiological roles. Through their ability to conduct calcium across the cellular membrane at potentials close to the resting potential, T-type calcium channels are critically important for regulating neuronal excitability, both in the central and peripheral nervous system. T-type channels are also linked to an increasing number of neurological disorders such as the absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Although there is substantial literature dealing with regulation of native T-type channels, the underlying molecular mechanism has only recently been addressed. It is, therefore, critical to understand the cellular mechanisms that control T-type channel activity and expression, because this could provide important insight into designing novel therapeutic strategies targeting these channels.","1293":"In this case study we wanted to find out the impact of Preventive Medicine and implicitly social marketing upon young students with the average age of 19, belonging to the academic environment in Romania. The study lasted one month and consisted of a questionnaire that was conceived and applied to 304 adolescents. The questionnaire contained demographic and personal information, such as age, origin, gender, marital status and some questions related to the respondents' attitude towards several issues that are inserted in the preventive medicine discipline, such as the date of their last consultation, if the respondents were registered to a family physician, suffered from chronic diseases, what was the rate of doing physical exercises, if they ate salty and fat meals, if they were on a diet, their rate of alcohol, caffeine and tobacco consumption. The panel was made up of more female respondents than male, with the average age rate of 19, who had medical consultations in the last 3 months, are included in the evidence of a family physician, had no chronic diseases, usually do workout exercises moderately, are not on a diet and have 3 meals per day. The meals are medium salty and rarely rich in fats. They drink 2 cups of tea per day and are non-alcohol drinkers and non-smokers. After applying several statistical tests to find a correlation between our variables, we reached the conclusion that even if the results are encouraging; there is no correlation between the impact of Preventive Medicine and the respondents' health behavior. ","1294":"The case presented raised our scientific curiosity and it is worthy of being brought in front of the medical audience because of several reasons presented below. Presently, there are 3 hereditary syndromes that have a demonstrated etiological relationship with the colorectal cancer: Familiar Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP syndrome), HNPCC syndrome (Hereditary Nonpoliposis Colorectal Cancer) and MAP syndrome.Discovered only in 2002, the MAP syndrome (MYH associated polyposis) is the first hereditary syndrome that has autosomal recessive transmission. The APC gene can be mutated in several ways during the colonic oncogenesis: congenital in the FAP syndrome, somatic in sporadic colorectal cancers and secondary to the MYH gene inactivation in MAP syndrome. MAP phenotype is similar to the FAP phenotype because of the somatic mutations to the APC gene. Colonic polyposis is lower than FAP syndrome and appeared later, in the 40's and 50's. Colorectal cancers are frequent and discovered in the same moment as the colonic polyposis. Patients are diagnosed mostly in cancer stages. Colonoscopy shows polyps disseminated around the entire colic frame. Treatment in these cases is total rectocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. When working in a general emergency surgery clinic, physicians are often faced with colorectal cancers in different evolutive stages, and mostly they are faced with their complications.","1295":"Human toxocariasis is primarily a soil-transmitted zoonosis, so children with geophagia are at an increased risk of toxocariasis, especially those living in homes with puppies that have not been dewormed. A 17-months-old female presented to our department with fever, abdominal distention and marked eosinophilia. Iron deficiency anemia, marked leukocytosis (79,000 cells\/mm(3)) accompanied by marked eosinophilia (55,000 cells\/mm(3)), and hyper-gammaglobulinemia were noted. On the basis of the strong serological positivity for toxocariasis, marked eosinophilia, and low-density lesions in the liver at computed tomography, a diagnosis of visceral larva migrans syndrome was made. Visceral larva migrans is usually suspected in a young child with history of geophagia, pets exposure, hepatomegaly, whose complete blood count reveals leukocytosis and marked eosinophilia. ","1296":"Splenic cysts represent a pathology seldom encountered in practice, the most often etiology being, parasitic, congenital and pseudo-cysts, which usually appear post-traumatically or after a splenic infarction.Splenic cysts indicate a surgical treatment when they are large (and thus present a high risk for complications such as rupture, hemorrhaging, compression of the neighboring organs), when they are symptomatic or present complications. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with splenic cyst in our Clinic, its discovery being incidental, while conducting investigations for an abdominal pain syndrome. The clinical case presented completely abides to the literary description-the diagnostic has been incidental, the large size of the cyst has determined the need for surgery (splenectomy), its etiology has been established by means of anatomo-pathological report (the presence of the epithelial inner wall that indicates congenital cysts). ","1297":"Patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms-(MPN) have a high risk of thrombotic complications. Portal vein thrombosis is a severe complication, which in many cases, appears at the onset of the disease; the risk factors are related to the presence of qualitatively altered thrombocytes and leucocytes, leading to their activation and appearance of leukocytes-platelet-aggregates; anomalies of portal vein endothelial cells are also implicated. The presence of JAK2V617F mutation increases the risk for splahnic thrombosis. We present three patients with portal vein thrombosis and Budd Chiari syndrome, who were further diagnosed with MPN-the thrombosis was the onset event of the disease. Patients were diagnosed with thrombosis of the portal vein before being diagnosed with MPN. Splenectomy was not associated with risk of thrombosis for the two cases in which it was performed; for one case, splenectomy was a therapeutic method to resolve portal hypertension. All patients had homozygous JAK2 mutation, which is associated in recent studies with increased risk of portal, mesenteric thrombosis. The high number of platelet was difficult to control for all patients. Bone marrow biopsy and determination of JAK status are valuable investigations for patients who have splenoportal thrombosis, with no apparent identifiable cause.

The patient was diagnosed with carcinoma breast of left side on edge biopsy and of right side by ultrasonography, which was confirmed on fine needle aspiration cytology. At the time of admission, ultrasonography of the abdomen and right breast were normal. After 1 month, the patient was readmitted with redness over the inner quadrant of the right breast skin.","1299":null,"1300":"The paper discusses the connection between emergence, pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics, focusing on the similarity between discrete patterns and fractal structures, and then describes different solutions to model reaction-diffusion systems as representative processes in morphogenesis. A specific example is the diffusion limited aggregation growth process, illustrated by the simulation of the evolution of a bacterial colony that shows the roles of instability and sensitivity in non-equilibrium pattern formation. Based on this particular case, it is shown how self-organization could be achieved from non-organized agglomeration of separate entities, in a region of space. We conclude with some brief remarks about universality, predictability and long-term prospects for this field of research.","1301":"The prolapse of one or several pelvic organs is a condition that has been known by medicine since its early days, and different therapeutic approaches have been proposed and accepted. But one of the main problems concerning the prolapse of pelvic organs is the need for a universal, clear and reliable staging method.Because the prolapse has been known and recognized as a disease for more than one hundred years, so are different systems proposed for its staging. But none has proved itself to respond to all the requirements of the medical community, so the vast majority were seen coming and going, failing to become the single most useful system for staging in pelvic organ prolapse (POP).The latest addition to the group of staging systems is the POP-Q system, which is becoming increasingly popular with specialists all over the world, because, although is not very simple as a concept, it helps defining the features of a prolapse at a level of completeness not reached by any other system to date. In this vision, the POP-Q system may reach the importance and recognition of the TNM system use in oncology.This paper briefly describes the POP-Q system, by comparison with other staging systems, analyzing its main features and the concept behind it.","1302":null,"1303":"During the past decade idiopathic venous thromboembolism has become a separate entity, a chronic illness which has required prolonged anticoagulation and other prevention strategies to avoid recurrences. This article reviews recent developments regarding unprovoked venous thromboembolism and its relation with thrombophilia. In the beginning, the latest definition of idiopathic venous thromboembolism is presented. The article continues with statistics about thrombophilia, related venous thromboembolism, and a classification of major thrombophilic factors according to their intrinsic risk of thrombosis and of thrombotic recurrences. Great interest is given to the predictors of recurrence and the importance of prolonged anticoagulation is underlined. The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the most common acquired thrombophilia, is presented separately. The revised diagnosis criteria are discussed. Some characteristics of the antiphospholipid syndrome are worth presenting: the risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis, the high risk of thrombotic recurrence and the diversity of antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients experiencing idiopathic venous thromboembolic event have a great risk of recurrence, and highly benefit from long time anticoagulation. Natural coagulation inhibitors deficiencies, homozygous factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A and the antiphospholipid syndrome, increase the risk of first venous thrombosis and their recurrences and require adequate prevention.","1304":"The existing personality inventories are exploring too general psychological features so that the possible psychology\/disease associations might be leveled out. We attempt to build a tool to explore the possible correlation between certain psychological features and the most common internal disorders. We have used two questionnaires containing many pairs of synonymous items (necessary for assessing the consistency of the answers). The items are divided into four main domains: preoccupation for the basal conditions of existence (health\/ disease\/ death, fear, money, lodging); interaction with other people; action, will\/ volition, self-assertion; and preoccupation with the exterior. In this first article we are presenting the correlations between items of the first domain, based on the answers from our first 3138 respondents. The concern about health is best reflected by general formulations. The desire for security is best expressed by items combining the worry about money and dwelling, and worst by items reflecting the eagerness to gain, keep or judiciously spend money. Among the various fears, those of future, darkness, and loneliness are better indicators of security concern. In assessing the anxiety about safety\/ security, specific worries are more revelatory than the general ones. Precaution and inclination for order are the best indicators for the aspiration to stability. Poorer ones are the desire for cleanliness and the tendency to attachment. Health and security concerns seem to be consistently linked. The consistency evaluating system will be based upon pairs of synonymous items correlated with a10(-200) or less error probability. ","1305":"Laparoscopic nephrectomy tends to become the new gold standard surgical technique in a selected population (non-functioning kidney, localised renal cell carcinoma). Day surgery is a popular pathway of care and, procedures of ever-increasing complexity are being considered. The aim of the study was to report the postoperative complications of day case laparoscopic nephrectomy, according to the Clavien system, and, to assess the feasibility of the procedure performed as a day case. This study included all the patients considered for day case transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy between May 2008 and November 2009. Sixteen consecutive patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were ten procedures on the left hand-side and six on the right hand-side. Age ranges from 22 to 77 years old. Male to female ratio was 9:7. The preoperative diagnosis was non-functioning kidney in 9 cases and kidney tumour in the other 7 cases. All but two patients have been discharged in the same day (87.5%). The readmission rate was of 12.5%. One wheel-chair bonded patient was readmitted four days after the procedure, because of adynamic ileus, and another one three days later because of wound infection. There were two grade I and one grade IV complications (Clavien system). The patient readmitted with grade IV complication, wheel-chair bonded because of cerebral palsy, was not a typical day surgery patient. The vast majority of complications were minor and resulted in no residual disability. In our small series, the day case laparoscopic nephrectomy was feasible and safe. ","1306":"Hypertension is a chronic disease, which represents one of the most common public health problems in the world and afflicts about 28% of the North Americans, 44% of the Europeans and 26% of the East Mediterranean people aged 35 to 64 years. In Iran, about 11.5% of the people who are over 15 years old are afflicted. Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease; it is the leading cause of stroke, heart attack, kidney disease and aortic aneurysm. This is a cross-sectional study, carried out on 200 patients who were referred to the Health centers of Yazd city in center of Iran. We adapted tools from previous studies. All patients were asked to express their personal goals with respect to their hypertension values. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were determined and their Alfa cronbach was (a=0.83). The mean number of years with hypertension was 8.7[+\/-]7.6. Men and women showed moderately high means for attitudes, subjective norms, and positive anticipated emotions toward trying to reduce or maintain their blood pressure. The data indicated there is significantly different between the personnel and housewives, with p&lt;0.001. In addition, the personnel's mean grade scores for trying the self-regulation of their blood pressure was (15.9[+\/-]4.08) and, in the housewives was (12.49[+\/-]4.33). The results of this study showed that the Model of Goal Behavior can explain more than 52% of the self-regulation of hypertension, so, this Model can be a basic Model for intervention in education, in order to decrease and control hypertension in patients. ","1307":"Identification of potential shared primary psychoprophylaxis and crime prevention is measured by analyzing the rate of commitments for patients-subjects to forensic examination. The statistic trial is a retrospective, document-based study. The statistical lot consists of 770 initial examination reports performed and completed during the whole year 2007, primarily analyzed in order to summarize the data within the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, Bucharest, Romania (INML), with one of the group variables being 'particularities of the psychiatric patient history', containing the items 'forensic onset', 'commitments within the last year prior to the examination' and 'absence of commitments within the last year prior to the examination'. The method used was the Kendall bivariate correlation. For this study, the authors separately analyze only the two items regarding commitments by other correlation alternatives and by modern, elaborate statistical analyses, i.e. recording of the standard case study variables, Kendall bivariate correlation, cross tabulation, factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. The results are varied, from theoretically presumed clinical nosography (such as schizophrenia or manic depression), to non-presumed (conduct disorders) or unexpected behavioral acts, and therefore difficult to interpret. One took into consideration the features of the batch as well as the results of the previous standard correlation of the whole statistical lot. The authors emphasize the role of medical security measures that are actually applied in the therapeutic management in general and in risk and second offence management in particular, as well as the role of forensic psychiatric examinations in the detection of certain aspects related to the monitoring of mental patients. ","1308":"The cannabinoid system consists of a complex array of receptors, substances with agonist\/antagonist properties for those receptors, biosynthetic machineries and mechanisms for cellular uptake and degradation for endocannabinoids. This system is in interrelation with other systems that comprise lipid mediators like prostaglandins\/leukotrienes systems. A clear antagonist, additive or synergic effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-cannabinoid associations was not yet demonstrated. Aim. The present study tried to summarize the existent data on NSAIDS-cannabinoid system interactions. A bibliographic research in Medline, Scirus, Embase was made using as keywords cannabinoid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, acetaminophen, coxibs, antinociceptive, antinociception, analgesia A systematization of the results focusing on the NSAIDs drugs interaction with the cannabinoid system was presented. Out of all the substances analyzed in the present review, acetaminophen was studied the most regarding its interferences with the cannabinoid system, mainly due to contradictory results. Some NSAIDs have additional influences on the cannabinoid system either by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) or by inhibiting a possible intracellular transporter of endocannabinoids. All the NSAIDs that inhibit COX2 can influence the cannabinoid system because a possible important degradative pathway for anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol might involve COX 2. One of the causes for the variety of experimental results presented might be due to pharmacokinetic mechanisms, depending on the route of administration and the dose ","1309":"During the last decennium a more focused attention has been directed to the presence of chronic inflammation in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but mainly to the high impact that this one has in generating and fastening the atherosclerotic process. To highlight the causal relationship between periodontal diseases (PD) and CVD. One of the most important chronic inflammations, present in the modern societies in the vast majority of the population, is represented by the periodontal diseases (PD). Both types of diseases are characterized by a high and continuously increasing prevalence. It is now clear that they share some common risk factors, but it would be of great interest, not only for a scientific purpose, but also from a possible health benefit, as PD can be prevented and treated efficiently, to prove that there is a causal link between these two pathologies. We will present a review of the actual data concerning their relationship. The study of this causal relationship is made more difficult due to the increased utilization, due to the guides' recommendations of the calcium antagonists (CA) in treating CVD. ","1310":"Current studies show that there is a significant lack of knowledge regarding the typical signs and risk factors associated with serious medical conditions among medical students and laypersons. Basic life support consists of a number of medical procedures provided to patients with life threatening conditions of the body that cause pain or dysfunction to the person. In spite of the fact that this programme is not included in the curricula, students might receive this information from various persons, even though these persons are not specialized in the domain of giving first aid. Learning medicine without placing patients at an increased risk of complications is of utmost importance in the medical profession. High-fidelity patient simulators can potentially achieve this, and, therefore they are increasingly used in the training of medical students. Recent studies regarding simulation training show that the simulation-based intervention offers a positively evaluated possibility to enhance students' skills in recognizing and handling emergencies improving the ability to manage medical emergencies. Understanding BLS courses and more than that, practicing these techniques is by far the most challenging task confronting first aid. Taking everything into consideration, we believe that an adequate education in first aid and basic life support should be considered an essential aspect of the medical curriculum. ","1311":"Authors have analyzed the psychosocial peculiarities of the women from Romania who are affected by eating disorders and alcohol excessive consumption, and studied the manner of the link between these diseases and the psychosexual. 120 participants at the study (Oltenia district) were divided into 2 groups: 60 healthy women, 30 with eating disorders and 30 alcohol dependent women. In all subjects were applied the following tests: Scale for compulsive appetite (SCA) and Scale of interest for own weight, both for eating disorders, CAGE questionnaire for alcohol dependence and two scales for determining: the gender-role ambivalence (O'Neil and Caroll Scale) and the masculinity and feminity index (A. Chelcea). The results obtained in both lots of Romanian women with pathologic behavior (food and\/or alcohol consumption) have indicated a low psychosexual identity versus control group but no correlation with masculinity\/feminity index.","1312":"Recent reports linking Down syndrome (DS) to maternal polymorphism at the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) locus have generated a great interest among investigators in the field. In the current study, we examine one genetic polymorphism involved in homocysteine\/folate pathway as a risk factor for DS in a Romanian urban-area women cohort. Our results show that the frequencies of MTHFD1 alleles, as well as the frequencies of MTHFD11958 genotypes (GG, GA, AA, GA+AA) do not correlate with DS pregnancies, demonstrating no difference between the case and control groups, as opposed to the findings of Scala et al. (2006) on an Italian cohort.","1313":"The first stage of this nationwide study and analysis of the occupational burnout and psychological risk parameters showed a high consistency of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment for doctors working in Emergency Departments and Emergency and Resuscitation Services. These workers were then set in the highest risk group for burnout syndrome and depression. This stage II of our research will focus on those two groups analyzing causal factors, coping mechanisms and possible repercussions of these findings.  We have issued a total of 272 surveys from which we have received a total of 263 complete and valid ones (n = 263, response rate = 96, 69%). The Maslach Burnout Inventory--Human Services Survey MBI-HSS is an instrument designed to assess the three components of the burnout syndrome: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). The COPE questionnaire is a 52 item addressing different ways of coping with stress. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) has been shown to be a reliable measure in assessing the number, types, and duration of depressive symptoms across racial, gender, and age categories. Results were not correlated with gender, age or marital status, but an important correlation was found with professional experience in the Emergency Departments. We have shown that during the first 4 years of experience, the EE factor has been at a satisfying average of 2.4, this variable rising to an average of 2.85 after another 3 years of work. The same type of correlation was found with the CES-D results. Of the two surveyed groups, the EMD group showed higher values for all risk parameters and low personal accomplishment on the MBI-HSS survey. Also, emotional exhaustion and depression were found to have a powerful correlation with work experience. Coping mechanisms were found to be invariable to the general population, with a slight incline towards active coping and behavioral disengagement. ","1314":"We are often confronted with severe cases - patients with very aggressive tumours that suppose a complex and in the same time radical approach--in our medical practice. The correct approach and management of such cases ensure both the surgical success and the patient survival. In this paper, we present the case of a young woman, who has been admitted in our clinic with a giant, irradiated tumour involving left axilla, shoulder and scapula. Due to the vast size of the tumour and to the fact that surgical biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated sarcoma; other clinics considered that the case above belongs to surgical therapy. After the clinical examination, blood tests and diagnostic imaging, which allowed the correct evaluation of the case--tumour sizes and neighbouring tissue reports--we decided to perform tumour radical excision, respectively forequarter amputation, when the patient presented a satisfactory metabolic status. The presented case supports the idea that radical excision which might involve even mutilating amputations for extensive cancers can give patients a chance, even in desperate cases.","1315":"Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and resulting in accumulation of homogentisic acid in collagenous structures. This causes the classic clinical triad: (1) homogentisic aciduria (urine blackens on standing when oxidized or alkalinized); (2) eumelanin-like pigmentation of skin, sclera, cartilages, etc and (3) degenerative ochronic arthropathies usually in the fourth decade of life. Other important but more rare consequences of alkaptonuric ochronosis are cardiovascular and urinary tract involvement. We present a case of ochronosis with multiple visceral involvement: skin (fingers, ear sclera), severe spondylarthropaty with extensive calcifications of intervertebral discs and reduced mobility, osteoarthritis of both knees, right hip ostonecrosis, cardiovascular involvement (severe stenosis and insufficiency of aortic valve that) and urinary tract involvement (nephrolitiasis)","1316":"Gelastic seizure (GS) also known as \"gelastic epilepsy\" is a rare type of seizure associated with several different conditions such as tumors--hypothalamic hamartromas, tuberous sclerosis, hemangiomas, post infectious foci, cortical temporal dysplasia. We report one case of this rare condition generated by a right gyrus cinguli gr. II astrocytoma. A 27 year-old male, right handed, was admitted for a 2 years history of very frequent gelastic seizures accompanied sometimes by simple motor partial seizures in both arms, more often being involved his left arm, without impairment of his consciousness state. His neurological examination was normal. Diagnosis was made on native CT scan: minimal hypodense frontal right paramedian lesion, cerebral MRI showed a small well delimited right, parenchymal, homogeneous lesion (16\/22\/15 mm), involving gyrus cinguli, without perilesional edema and mass effect, hyperintense both on T1 and T2 MR sequences, non-enhancing after Gadolinium. The cerebral lesion was also documented on EEG and video-EEG recordings. Using an interhemispheric microsurgical approach, above the corpus callosum and the right pericallosal artery, at the level of gyrus cinguli, a yellow-gray, infiltrative tumor, having a moderate vascularisation, has been identified and totally removed. The anatomopathological analysis revealed a grade II astrocytoma. The patient recovered very well, without deficits, no gelastic seizures or epileptic manifestations; three months after operation he is still free of seizures. A case of gelastic seizures accompanied by simple motor partial seizures in both arms, without the impairment of his consciousness state induced by a grade II right gyrus cinguli astrocytoma is described and documented by radiological and electrophysiological studies. Using microsurgical resection, the tumor was totally removed, the patient clinical condition improved. Without an affective connotation as in temporal or hypothalamus topography, gelastic seizures are not patognomonic for hypothalamic hamartomas and in the case of frontal localization of the lesion; they can be associated with motor involvement of the limbs as in our case. ","1317":"The Commission's Green Paper on Bio-preparedness represents an important signal that the European Commission is actively involved in, working on issues related to bio-preparedness across all Member States and the international Community. In 2006, the Commission held two seminars on European Bio Preparedness and a workshop on Transport and Traceability of Bio materials. The results and recommendations emerging from these discussions have been inserted in this Green Paper. The document intends to stimulate a debate within and between the Member States and to launch a process of consultation on how to reduce biological risks and to enhance preparedness and response. All the national authorities responsible for risk prevention and response, human, animal and plant health, customs, civil protection, law enforcement authorities, the military, bio-industry, epidemiological and health communities, academic institutions and bioresearch institutes are therefore called to be involved, to contribute and to improve the ability of the EU to prevent, respond to and recover from a biological incident or deliberate criminal activity.","1318":"Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by high prevalence in society, frequent hospitalization, reduced quality of life and high mortality (overall, 50% of patients are dead at an interval of 4 years, annual mortality varying from 5% to 75%). Outcomes in heart failure are highly variable, prognosis of individual patients differs considerably and trial data, though valuable, does not often give an adequate direction. Taking into account the high prevalence of heart failure in society and its complexity physicians need a model to predict the risk of death, to estimate the survival of heart failure patients. A key element of interest in this area is the survival function, usually noted by S and defined as S(t) = exp(-H0(t)e(a)Tx) = e(-H)0(t)e(a)Tx.","1319":"Adipose tissue displays characteristics of an endocrine organ releasing a number of adipocyte-specific factors known as adipocytokines. It has been recently suggested that adipocytokines may play a role in pathogenesis and progression of certain cancers, in particular in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between several blood adipocytokine levels and clinicopathological characteristics of colon cancer patients undergoing surgery. The study group comprised of 29 patients who underwent surgical resection for colon cancer at Emergency University Hospital Bucharest and 27 healthy volunteers. The serum levels of adipocytokines were measured using multianalyte xMap profiling technology (Luminex). Resistin levels were significantly higher in colon cancer patients while leptin serum levels were significantly lower as compared to controls. Leptin levels decreased gradually with tumor stage and aggressiveness. Taken together, these results of this study suggest that adipokines, in particular resistin and leptin may be involved in development and progression of colon cancer.","1320":"Deficiencies of natural anticoagulants protein C, protein S, antithrombin and activated protein C resistance are components of inherited thrombophilia. Inherited thrombophilia was defined as a genetically determined tendency towards venous thromboembolism, which characteristically occurs in young patients (before 40 to 45 years old), without apparent causes, and tend to recur. There have been many debates about the implication of these defects in arterial thromboses (peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction) in the recent years. The screening for thrombophilia is recommended for young patients with spontaneous thromboses, arterial infarctions, family history of thromboses, personal history of recurrent abortions, with thrombosis of venous dural sinuses or strokes or myocardial infarctions, in patients with venous thrombosis in unusual sites, because the diagnosis of such a disease leads to a treatment that is lifesaving [1,2].","1321":"The aim of our study was to assess macro- and microscopically the knee cartilaginous lesions outcome treated by mosaicplasty. Our study included 32 patients who underwent mosaicplasty for nondegenerative cartilaginous lesions of the knee and a second look arthroscopy. In 21 patients, minibiopsies from the repaired lesion were performed under arthroscopic control (from the cartilaginous region of the transplanted osteocartilaginous grafts and from the spaces between grafts). All repaired lesions were carefully examined during arthroscopy and all harvested minifragments were studied by optical microscopy (staining method - hematoxylin eosin). Macroscopically, the articular surface of the repaired cartilaginous lesions was smooth and congruent to the adjacent surfaces. The aspect and resistance to compression of grafted area was similar to those of the normal surrounding cartilage. The transferred cartilage maintained its height, being at the level of the neighboring cartilage. One year postoperatively, the limits of the cartilaginous autografts were still visible. Two years postoperatively, these limits were no longer visible. Microscopically, the region of the former lesion was constituted mainly by viable hyaline cartilage. Fibrous cartilaginous tissue was visualized in the spaces between the grafts. The second look arthroscopy showed that after mosaicplasty the repaired articular surface was smooth, leveled, homogenous and congruent to adjacent cartilage. The spaces between grafts are progressively covered by fibrous cartilaginous tissue with a more textured and uneven surface. Mosaicplasty is a biological surgical technique, which restores the normal osteocartilaginous architecture of the most part of the grafted area. The transplanted osteocartilaginous cylindrical grafts maintain its viability and mechanical properties. ","1322":"The use of laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of rectal cancer was until recently regarded with skepticism, because it did not seem to fulfill the oncologic principles of open surgery. The first report of a rectal cancer case treated by using laparoscopy has been made approximately two decades ago. From that moment on, the laparoscopic technique, progressed thanks to the development of the optical devices that allowed the improvement of the laparoscopic image, as well as the progressive increase of experience of the surgical teams specialized in colorectal laparoscopic surgery. These advantages (the faster recovery of the bowel function, less postoperative pain, lower blood loss, decreased hospitalization period) make the laparoscopic surgery a viable option for the treatment of rectal cancer. Recently published studies prove the similar results between open surgery and laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, in terms of mortality and postoperative morbidity, local recurrence, long-term survival or postoperative complications (anastomotic fistulas, bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction), some studies even revealing the superiority of the laparoscopic surgery in preserving the function of the pelvic nerves.","1323":"At the beginning of the 21st century the hypopharynx and the cervical esophagus cancer represents a major issue for all countries of the world. The epidemiology of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus cancer deals with the spread of the disease in the human population with regard to sex, age, profession, time and space, as well as risk factors that contribute to these phenomena. The main goal is to investigate the causes and the factors involved in the development of the tumors at the pharyngoesophageal junction, knowledge that contributes to the latest therapeutic assessment through interdisciplinary collaboration (E.N.T. surgeon, general surgeon, radiation oncologist, chemotherapist, and nutritionist). The epidemiology of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus cancer includes three major areas of interest: descriptive (the study of the spread in mass population), analytical (the study of causal risk factors on the disease) and experimental (that verifies by experiments on animals the prior identified hypothesis).","1324":"Since the first attempts of kidney transplant, the inflammation mediated by T lymphocytes was considered one of the most important processes implicated in graft rejection but, multiple acute and chronic graft rejects revealed that the inflammation process is not singular and humoral mechanisms may play a role in the development of chronic vascular rejection. We evaluated 500 Romanian patients registered on the kidney transplant waiting list. We performed anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies screening and identification. Laboratory tests were performed at Centre for Immunogenetics and Virology, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania. The methods used are represented by ELISA (GTI Diagnosis, USA) and Luminex (Tepnel, USA) RESULTS: pretransplant evaluation of the subjects illustrates that 145 patients (29%) have been sensitized and 355 patients (71%) have not been sensitized. The most frequent types of anti-HLA antibodies were A2 (13%), B42 (10%), DR7 and DR11 (13%). Post transplant, the most cases with de novo antibodies were observed in the first 6 months post transplantation. High serum levels of Il-2 Receptor, TNF-alpha and neopterin in post transplant sensitized patients were observed following de novo cytotoxic antibodies occurrence. post renal transplantation, patients present high risk in developing de novo cytotoxic antibodies, especially those who had HLA mismatch with the donor. These antibodies are predictors for acute graft rejection and for graft failure. ","1325":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emergent imaging technique, based on the interference of infrared radiation and living tissues, that allows the in vivo visualization of the skin structures, at high resolution and up to 1.6 mm depth. As such, there is mounting evidence that OCT may be an interesting technique for the diagnosis of skin diseases, including the noninvasive early detection of cutaneous tumors. We aimed to investigate the utility of OCT for the diagnosis of non-melanocytic, non-pigmented cutaneous tumors. Preliminary results are presented from an initiated study. Fifteen consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of epithelial cancers and precancers registered over one week in a university dermatologic department were included. As control were selected 7 patients with inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, lichen planus, cutaneous lupus erythematosus). In all study and control patients, the lesions and samples of normal, perilesional skin were documented by clinical digital photography, contact dermoscopy with digital image capture and OCT with central wavelength of 930 nm. Final diagnosis was certified by histopathological analysis. We could identify morphological features in OCT examination that distinguished between normal and lesional skin, and between neoplastic vs. inflammatory lesions. In the same time, combining OCT and dermatoscopical evaluation of a lesion improved the performance of diagnosis when compared to clinical diagnosis alone and with either OCT or dermoscopy imaging used alone. OCT appears as a promising method of in vivo diagnosis of early neoplastic cutaneous lesions with equivocal clinical and\/or dermoscopic aspect. Continuation of our study as well as other larger investigation will be able to contribute with new insights in the role of OCT in the non-invasive diagnosis of skin disease. ","1326":"BPH remains one of the most common diseases that the urologist has to manage. The last decade brought numerous new techniques, aiming to improve the minimally invasive approach to BPH, but, for the moment, none had changed the place of TURP as the gold standard treatment for medium sized prostates. Based on a large personal experience, the authors present a study in which TURP is used for prostates over 80 ml, the cutoff point set by the guidelines of the European Association of Urology. The rationale for this study is that many situations require minimally invasive treatment, based on the express request of the patient, other conditions that makes open surgery very difficult or impossible, or the need for a quick discharge in an overcrowded service. The aim of the study was to prove that TURP is safe and effective even in larger prostates. The technique used is basically the classic one, with minor tactical alterations in some cases. Some cases required a two-stage approach, but offered good functional results after the first stage. The results proved that, with a good technique, a skilled urologist might achieve the same results by using TURP or open surgery for large sized prostates.","1327":"The present paper makes a research about negative effects of anger and hostile conduct on peoples' health status. We have studied scientific articles published between 2000 and 2010, which did not contradict our initial assumption. The literature demonstrates that anger, wheatear suppressed or expressed, can determine various diseases, it can influence the conduct of people suffering from bulimia nervosa or it can be the cause for the growing number of car accidents. In order to avoid these risks, the intervention should not be limited to medication, but it should also involve a psychological help that should insist on ways of dealing with anger without exposing the person to any kind of risk for his health or wellbeing.","1328":"Gallstone ileus represents a rare (0.3-0.5%), but serious complication of a common illness--the gallbladder lithiasis and the incidence of this fascinating disease has remained the same over the years. The main actual characteristics of this pathology are the age over 65, the female gender (men\/women ratio 1\/5:1:10--due to the high rate of vesicular lithiasis) and the under 50% diagnostic established preoperatively. The frequency of gallstone ileus recurrence is of 4,7-5%. In this article, we discuss the pathogenesis of this illness presenting all the mechanisms described in the medical literature. The Rigler triad found at the abdominal CT-scan generally established the diagnosis. Still, in 25% of the cases we have a misdiagnosis because of the underestimation of the size of the gallstone. Finally, the treatment of gallstone ileus has had major changes from the past. We described the endoscopic and laparoscopic approach, which represents the modern treatment of this disease. Despite these diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, the mortality remains high and the common causes are associated comorbidities and late presentation to the physician.","1329":"Due to its objectivity, reproducibility and predictive value confirmed by many large-scale statistical clinical studies, Heidelberg Retina Tomography has become one of the most used computerized image analysis of the optic disc in glaucoma. It has been signaled, though, that the diagnostic value of Moorfieds Regression Analyses and Glaucoma Probability Score decreases when analyzing optic discs with extreme sizes. The number of false positive results increases in cases of megalopapillae and the number of false negative results increases in cases of small size optic discs. The present paper is a review of the aspects one should take into account when analyzing a HRT result of an optic disc with anatomic particularities.","1330":"An overall aim of treatment in multiple sclerosis is to lower the negative impact of the disease on functioning and quality of life of patients. Therefore, a measurement of functioning and quality of life should be included in the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment. The most commonly used quality of life questionnaires, either generic or specific, were presented in this paper,. Information about clinical and functional status is useful in the interpretation of the quality of life assessment results. Because of that, instruments for the assessment of depression, cognitive functions, functional ability and fatigue in multiple sclerosis were also described.","1331":"Since there have been a number of empirical observations that may lead to the conclusion of an increasing rate of risk behaviors in Romanian students, such as aggression, over-competitive conduct and lack of collaboration, immorality, peer pressure and even an increasing rate of suicide, and suicide attempts, we have undergone a study to indentify if there is a high rate of risk type personality patterns that may lead to these deportments. We have selected a total number of 500 students from the three largest universities in Bucharest, Romania--\"Carol Davila\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy (UMF), Bucharest Polytechnics University (UPB), and the Bucharest Academy of Economical Studies (ASE). All subjects received a questionnaire containing four diagnostic tools and several demographics questions. We have chosen the Twenty Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS20), the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS-13) and the Anger-In Questionnaire for type C personality pattern. We have also added the Columbia stress analysis questionnaire for the evaluation of stress levels and coping capacity at the moment the subjects were interviewed. Columbia stress survey results confirm that there is a high stress level among students of all universities, but a more detailed stratification by university, gender and analyzed factor shows a very high F factor and T factor positive responses. Alexithymia, Type A and Type C personality patterns show a much higher prevalence than the general population, especially in medical students. We have found higher frequencies in men for all of the three studied parameters Approaching alexithymia and type A behavior both by cognitive methods and by assessing and addressing consequential risk factors should become an issue among universities. ","1332":"In recent years, urology has seen a real explosion in the development of new technologies. Modern treatment techniques replaced classic therapeutic methods, among which open surgery had an important role. Endourologic therapies led to effective and safe interventions, increased patient comfort and reduced costs. The \"Saint John\" Emergency Clinical Hospital Department of Urology always intended to align to the new standards of urological treatment including, primarily, minimally invasive techniques, some of them being performed as national premieres. Ureteroscopy is one of them, thus introducing the rigid and semi rigid endoscopes as part of the therapeutic arsenal of our clinic in 1994 and flexible ureteroscopy in 2002. If the targeted pathology was initially limited to stone disease, ureteroscopy currently covers a wide range of affections, being used both for therapeutic but also for diagnostic purposes. Thus, the ureteroscopic approach can diagnose and treat a wide range of upper urinary tract pathologies (lithiasis, tumors, malformations, iatrogenic injuries, etc.). The new technology acquisitions made by our clinic, increased performance, resulting in a complete and fast resolution in many cases, previously implying additional effort from the surgeons. If at first the ureteroscopies' share of daily practice was modest, in recent years it has achieved an extraordinary growth, thus becoming available to both experienced surgeons and young urologists. We believe that our extensive experience in endourological approach is significant and will have a say in the technological developments, which will help both the patients and the practicing urologists.","1333":"We present the case of a 21-year-old man with advanced refractory Parkinson's disease treated with Duodopa continuous infusion. With this therapy, the patient had a spectacular recovery but after six months, he experienced an aggravation of his symptoms. A failure of his pumping system was suspected but we discovered that the jejunal tube was blocked due to a knot around a bezoar. This is the first complication of this kind described with the Duodopa infusion technique.","1334":"Usually, insulinomas are small sized, insulin secreting, benign tumors of the pancreas, and require surgical treatment. We report the case of a female patient, of 61 years old, with pancreatic insulinoma localized in the junction between the head and the istm of the pancreas, of 1,4 cm in size, which induced hypoglycemia due to endogenous insulin hypersecretion. The tumor was removed by laparoscopic enucleation in March 2009. In the postoperative period, the blood glucose level came back to normal.","1335":"Many patients with chronic illnesses suffer from clinical depression (with percentages reported by clinical studies ranging from 15 to 60); even depression is more common in people with chronic medical illnesses, (e.g. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) than in the general population. However, not every patient with a chronic illness suffers from depression. It is well known that some people think the persons who suffer from a chronic illness have a reason to be depressed, so, there is no need to go to a psychiatrist for treatment. The fact is that not only the medical condition can be the cause for depression and, not always, the treatment for a medical illness can supply the treatment for depression. The condition of clinical depression, associated with a chronic illness, needs to be early diagnosed and early treated because it can worsen the medical state. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease, which affects many organs and systems. The link between lupus and depression is controversial but it is known that negative life events, lupus activity and the treatment for disease may be capable of contributing to clinical depression. We present the case of a young woman who was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and who initially presented in the psychiatric department for depressive symptoms. The case raised problems in terms of diagnosis, treatment, etiology and prognosis.","1336":"Primary tumors of the heart, pericardium and inferior vena cava are extremely rare. Three cases of surgically\/biopsy proven angiosarcoma of the right atrium, pericardial lipoma and leiomyosarcoma of inferior vena cava--demonstrated by ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)--are presented here.","1337":"Ascites, dilutional hyponatremia and hepatorenal syndrome are three clinical manifestations of the same physiopathological disorder: cirrhotic portal hypertension, hyperproduction of nitric oxide, arterial vasodilation with reduction of efficient arterial volume, which have as consequences renal vasoconstriction, sympathetic stimulation, the stimulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system and of vasopressin secretion. In dilutional hyponatremia, the selective receptor V2 (vasopressin 1) antagonists may be efficient according to Spanish and American specialists and also according to personal experience.","1338":"There are still many things to be found out about interstitial cystitis\/painful bladder syndrome (IC\/PBS) because the pathological processes underlying the condition are not yet elucidated, biological markers of the condition are not yet available, and the type and severity of symptoms can vary, so, clearly defining the condition is not yet possible. For example, it is not clearly understood whether IC\/PBS represents a systemic disease, if it is localized in the bladder, or if it was initially localized in the bladder and it later evolved into a systemic disease. This condition is best managed by using a multidisciplinary approach. Management requires a good integration and knowledge of all pelvic organ systems and other systems including musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric systems.","1339":"Chronic Myeloid Leukemia is the first malignant disorder with a specific genetic abnormality in the background. Known as a disease with an inexorable progression to acute leukemia for many years, its natural history has been dramatically improved by the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). They represent the first molecular targeted therapy addressed to a neoplastic disorder. From these new classes of drugs, Imatinib was the first drug ever used, and it remains the standard therapy for patients in chronic phase with CML, having a global survival of 86%, for 7 years. The 2nd generation of TKI (Dasatinib, Nilotinib) is indicated for the patients who are refractory or intolerant to Imatinib. The other TKI have good promises to be efficient on the mutations of BCR-ABL transcript, especially to non-responsive T315I mutation.","1340":"The goal of the study is to show the histological and biochemical changes that indicate the angiogenesis of the intervertebral disc in lumbar intervertebral disc hernia and the existence of epidemiological correlations between these changes and the risk factors of lumbar intervertebral disc hernia, as well as the patient's quality of life (QOL). We have studied 50 patients aged between 18 and 73 years old, who have undergone lumbar intervertebral disc hernia surgery, making fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor level measurements, as elements in the process of appreciating the disc angiogenesis. Also, pre-surgery and post-surgery QOL has been measured, as well as the intensity of the pain syndrome. We have identified factors capable of stimulating vascular endothelial growth (VEGF, FGF-2) for the examined disc material, but histological examination did not show angiogenesis. The process of angiogenesis at the degenerated intervertebral disc level affects the patient's quality of life both pre and postoperatively, and may be a predictive factor for the post-operative results. Patients can prevent the appearance of angiogenesis type degenerative processes of the intervertebral disc by avoiding angiogenesis correlated factors (weight control, physical effort, and smoking).","1341":"Pressure sores can be defined as lesions caused by unrelieved pressure resulting in damage of the underlying tissue. They represent a common problem in the pathology of plegic patients and, plastic surgery has a significant role in their treatment. Pressure sores occur over bony prominences and so, they are most commonly seen at the sacrum and trochanters in paralyzed patients and at ischium for the patients who sit in a wheelchair for a long time. For these patients, surgical treatment is very important because on one hand, it stops the loss of nutrients and proteins at the site of the pressure sore, and on the other hand, it permits the initiation of neuromuscular recuperation treatment much faster.","1342":"Arterial hypertension (HT), being the main factor of negative evolution for chronic nephropathies, has imposed a careful adjustment of pharmacological treatment. The widespread use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) has brought into attention the side effects of this class of antihypertensive drugs. The study focuses on the clinical and paraclinical evaluation of these elements, by means of detecting variations in serum creatinine, natriuresis and diuresis levels factors. In addition, cardiac cavity measurements have been made and the results have lead to the conclusion that the decision to administer ACE inhibitors has to be well founded, and patients should be closely monitored in order to prevent complications of the primary disease.","1343":"The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cerebrolysin in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a 10-days course of therapy with a daily administration of Cerebrolysin (50 mL i.v. per day). The trial had to demonstrate that Cerebrolysin treatment is safe in hemorrhagic stroke. The study was performed as a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with 2 treatment groups. Efficacy measures were the Unified Neurological Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and Syndrome Short Test. The duration of the trial was of 21 days for each patient. Out of 100 randomized patients, a total of 96 (96%) completed the study. Overall, no statistically significant group effects were observed based on single average comparisons at the individual visits. It could be shown that the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke with Cerebrolysin is safe and well tolerated. In the changes of UNSS, BI and SST from baseline to day 21, the group differences are not statistically significant; however, the use of Cerebrolysin in hemorrhagic stroke is safe and well tolerated and studies with a larger sample size may provide statistical evidence of Cerebrolysin's efficacy in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. ","1344":"The present review represents a concise and complete survey of the literature covering 2004-2009, concerning the mass spectrometric techniques involved in the structural investigation of renal calculi. After a short presentation of the fundamental mass spectrometric techniques (MALDI-TOF, QTOF, MS-MS) as well as hyphenated methods (GC-MS, LC-MS, CE-MS), an extensive study of the urinary proteome analysis as well as the detection and quantification by mass spectrometry of toxins, drugs and metabolites from renal calculi is presented.","1345":"Although the healing means 2 types of biological mechanisms that seem to be \"pathologic\", the swell and the granulations are a normal process in the biology of the human being, representing two systemic functions: the adaptation and the morphogenesis. There is a pathological healing in which the fundamental healing phenomenon is deviated from the normal. There are three variable parameters responsible for the pathological evolution of a scar: the cellular population, the fundamental matrix and the fibers. The healing evolution can be deviated to an intense maturation with an \"old\", atrophic scar, or to an incomplete maturation and the result is a hypertrophic or a keloid scar. For the hypertrophic scars, the excision and the skin graft lead to good results and the relapses are rare; the keloid relapse is always at the border between the graft and the wound edge, or between the two skin grafts. These are the considerations for which the treatments are mixed, combined (surgical, drugs, physiotherapy) both in our country and abroad, but the results are still frustrating. That is why new, modern methods of treatment are used today: criotherapy, laser, ultrasounds. However, even those treatments are not very successful: tissue expander, external press therapy, corticosteroids injections, other pharmacological agents (retinoic acid, colchicines, antineoplasics). We propose a regenerative, alternative, non-invasive treatment starting from the results we obtained in a research work 4 years ago, when we irradiated the fibroblasts in an electromagnetic high frequency millimeter waves field, and we obtained the fibroblasts apoptosis and the reorganization of the collagen fibers by changing the piezoelectric emission.","1346":"There is an imperious need of redefining placebo effect in contemporary times. The effects of sham medical intervention, combined with a careful observation of the natural evolution of a disease, could reveal the true efficiency and impact of active drugs. This interest is not driven only by a scientific curiosity, but also by the pragmatic fact that the standard process of approving new medicines through supportive clinical trials requires a comparison against placebo. A complete understanding of the placebo effect should include both its psychological mechanisms and the underlying neurobiology. In contrast to other type of conditions, neurological disorders could provide specific clues in understanding the placebo effect, since the pathogenic mechanisms of different diseases might interfere with neuronal circuitry involved in the perception of disease symptoms. However, there are ethical considerations dictating the limits of using placebo. This paper reviews recent articles about placebo effect, with an emphasis on its importance in several neurological conditions (Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, headache, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy), and intends to offer new insights on this major topic.","1347":"The aim of this article is to present the development of the pharmaceutical industry in Syria using national and international public data sources. At the end of the 80ies, the pharmaceutical industry in Syria was very poor, covering 6% of the national needs. In less than 20 years, with the government support in terms of legal frame and strategic political engagement, the Syrian pharmaceutical industry finally covered almost 90% of the national needs, in terms of drugs, and exported drugs in around 52 Arabian countries. Beyond covering the local market, the main added values of this huge development consisted in exporting drugs in amount of 150 million dollars per year and providing jobs for 17000 Syrian people, out of which around 85% are women. Strong and weak points of the pharmaceutical sector are taken into consideration in the article and further interventions to support a sustainable development are proposed by the author.","1348":"Personalized medical care has been consistently proven in literature as contributing to the maintenance of psychological balance and quality of life in patients suffering from chronic conditions. However, limited research has investigated the role of personalized approach in improving these parameters in patients with advanced incurable diseases. The scope of this paper was to investigate the possible impact of personalized care condition in advanced colon cancer patients, requiring palliative care. 60 patients (32 M, 28 F) (mean age 64.6) suffering from this disease were randomly assigned to a standard or to a personalized care condition. The latest implied (a) frequent (at least 2 monthly) meetings with the doctor, (b) possibility to be involved in treatment decisions, (c) more information given about diagnosis and prognosis and (d) psychological support provided to the patient and his\/her family members, to deal better with daily problems and needs. The design of the study was prospective and consisted of two successive evaluations of quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) and anxiety and depression (HAD test). Cancer patients pertaining to the personalized treatment approach had both superior quality of life scores (p &lt; 0.05) and lower anxiety (p &lt; 0,01) and depression (p &lt; 0.05) than the control group. A more detailed analysis showed significant differences of vitality and social functioning for subjects pertaining to the study group (p &lt; 0.05), as well as a lower ratio between latent and manifest anxiety (p &lt; 0,01). These results argue in favor of the benefits of a personalized treatment approach for patients with advanced incurable diseases.","1349":"In patients suspected of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), a normal CT should be followed by lumbar puncture (LP) to detect xanthochromia. We studied the practice of performing a LP following a normal CT in patients with a clinical suspicion of SAH in a District General Hospital. We aimed to assess whether patients were being fully investigated for SAH and whether standards were being met. This was a prospective study aiming to improve the patient's care by implementing the best practice. We initially recorded CT and LP results of patients with suspected SAH (phase 1) and presented the results to the referring clinicians. After a period of time, data was re-collected to study any change in practice (phase 2). In phase 1, 36 of 61 patients (59.0%) with a normal CT had a subsequent LP compared to 67\/104 (64.4%) in the second phase (p = 0.51). In the first phase, xanthochromia was detected in 1 of 36 patients (2.8%) who had a LP following a normal CT, compared to 1 of 67 patients (1.5%) in the second phase (p = 1.0). Approximately a third of patients with symptoms of SAH in both study periods did not undergo LP following a normal CT scan. This is an important finding, as it is known that a normal CT does not exclude the diagnosis of SAH and by not proceeding to LP, patients have not been fully investigated for a SAH.

Second line agents used in RA treatment require careful monitorization in terms of efficiency and tolerability. trends, predictive factors and characteristics of clinical, biological and radiological RA monitorization in a cross sectional observational cohort study, conducted on over 206 patients in Romania, with a 12 months follow up (December 2007 - December 2008). Cases were recruited from the south-west region of the country, covering a geographical area of 23 counties. Patients were invited to complete three sets of interviews (collected by post) in a consent letter, containing self reported questionnaires, at 6 months intervals: an original questionnaire (which included quantitative self reported of pain, disease activity and fatigue on visual analogue scale-VAS), Health Assessment Questionnaire-HAQ-Disability and Discomfort Scales and EUROQOL EQ-5D, validated in Romanian (obtaining a user agreement by authors of the original version). analysis was carried out in SPSS 10. The cohort enrolled 206 patients, with the average age of 54.90 +\/- 12.67 years, 66% urban, 86.4% women, 29.1% professionally active, 48.5% graduates of primary education. The average disease duration after diagnosis of RA was of 9.40 +\/- 8.87 years. The duration of the treatment reported at baseline was of 2.70 +\/- 2.64 years. Most patients followed a program of monthly monitoring at a general practitioner (GP) (41.7% at baseline and 37.1% to 12 months). Visits to the rheumatologist followed a monthly regimen (32.3% at baseline and 31.7% to 12 months) or a 2 months interval (19.4% at baseline and 29.6% to 12 months, p = 0.000). Biological monitoring was quarterly (39.6% and 53.2% at 12 months; p = 0.000) or at 2 months interval (26.2% at baseline and 16.7% to 12 months, p = 0.000). X-ray monitoring lacked in over half the cases in a year of disease progression (63.3% at 6 months and 62.2% at 12 months), although it sums between 1 and 3 radiographs to one third of the cases (36.8%), generally, in our country, there is a lack of aggregation in the dispensarization algorithm of patients with RA; consequently, the decision is awarded to the human factor. Under these circumstances, some patients are over evaluated. Promoting a dispensarization guide for RA patients could induce benefits both clinically and economically. Therefore, we submit a proposal of recommendations as a guideline for clinical, biological and radiological monitoring, according to the phase and stage of RA. ","1351":null,"1352":"This clinical trial studies local invasions from primary colonic and rectal cancers (urinary bladder, abdominal wall, small bowls, uterus, vagina, stomach, bile tract, spleen, duodenum, pancreas, ureters, kidneys), with or without undiscovered metastasis. Primary locally aggressive colonic and rectal cancers include tumors that are staged T4N1-2Mx on diagnosis, and are often associated with a lower prognosis than earlier cancers. Diagnosis is based on thorough clinical evaluation, imagistic support: abdominal XR with contrast (barium enema), colonoscopy, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound exam, endoscopic endolumenal ultrasound exam, abdominal and pelvic CT\/IRM with contrast (administrated both orally and intravenously), PET Scan, and intra-operatory confirmation. The primary symptom was pain. Locally aggressive colonic and rectal cancers, primary or secondary, can extend to any visceral or parietal structure. The ability to perform a total resection is based upon anatomical localization and on the fixation of other organs to the lesion. Identifying the anatomical extension provides a better appreciation of the purpose of the tumoral resection. Radical nuanced surgery is the base of treatment of the locally aggressive colon-rectal cancer. The studies have shown that in certain localizations of the colon-rectal cancer, the locally aggressive forms can be better controlled by using multimodal therapy, including radiotherapy, either external or guided intraoperatory radiotherapy and chemotherapy with much better results.","1353":"One of the rarest situations regarding an adrenal incidentaloma is an adrenal cyst. We present the case of a 61-year-old male patient diagnosed with peritonitis. During surgery, a right adrenal tumor of 2 cm is discovered. The patient was referred to endocrinology. 6 months later the diameter of the tumor is 7 times bigger than the initial stage. It has no secretory phenotype, except for the small increase of serum aldosterone and the 24-h 17-ketosteroids. Open right adrenalectomy is performed and a cyst of 15 cm is removed. The evolution after surgery is good. The pathological exam reveals an adrenal cyst with calcifications and osteoid metaplasia. The immunohistochemistry showed a positive reaction for CD34 and ACT in the vessels and VIM in the stroma. The adrenal cysts are not frequent and represent a challenge regarding the preoperative diagnostic and surgical procedure of resection. The pathological exam highlights the major aspects.","1354":"The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of Cerebrolysin administration in Broca's aphasics with acute ischemic stroke. We registered 2212 consecutive Broca's aphasics following an acute ischemic stroke admitted in four departments of neurology in Romania, between September 2005 and September 2009. Language was evaluated with the Romanian version of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB). The following inclusion criteria were used for this study: age 20-75 years, admission in the hospital within 12 hours from the onset of the symptoms, diagnosis of first acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke, presence of large artery disease (LAD) stroke, a NIHSS score of 5-22 points, and a therapeutic time window within 72 h. Fifty two patients were treated with Cerebrolysin (Cerebrolysin group) as an adjunctive treatment. A placebo group, which received saline infusions (n=104 patients) were matched to the NIHSS and WAB scores, gender and age of the Cerebrolysin group at baseline. We assessed spontaneous speech (SS), comprehension (C), repetition (R), naming (N), and Aphasia Quotient (AQ) scores of the two groups in an open label design, over 90 days, the mRS scores and mortality. The Cerebrolysin and the placebo groups had similar age (66 +\/- 8 versus 65 +\/- 8 years) and sex ratio (14\/38 versus 30\/74). The mean AQ scores and the mean subscores for 3 subtests of WAB (SS, R, N) were similar at baseline and improved in the Cerebrolysin group significantly (p &lt; 0.05) over placebo group at all study time points. The mRS score at 90 days was also lower in the Cerebrolysin group than in the placebo group. Cerebrolysin and placebo were both tolerated and safe, and no difference in the mortality rate was seen (3.8% in each group). Cerebrolysin is effective for the treatment of Broca's aphasics with a first acute ischemic stroke of the left MCA territory. ","1355":"Nonoperative management (NOM) of liver trauma is currently rather the rule than the exception. However, the current evidence presents subgroups of patients at higher risk for NOM failure. These patients must be treated more cautiously regarding the NOM approach. A case report of 3 polytrauma patients (Injury Severity Score &gt; 17) with high-degree liver trauma managed nonoperatively. The first case presented is the one of a polytrauma patient with degree IV liver injury and impaired mental status. It was a high risk for NOM failure because there was an angiographically hemostasis. The second case is one of a polytrauma patient who became hemodynamically stable after the administration of 2000 ml of fluid intravenously. There was a nonoperative approach with angiography and embolization of degree IV liver injury. Despite the success of the nonoperative treatment, there was an important hepatic necrosis following embolization. The third case is one of a polytrauma patient with a degree IV hepatic injury. Success was accomplished in NOM without an angiography. Nonoperative management of liver injuries can be applied safely even in high degree hepatic trauma. In hemodynamically metastable patients or impaired mental status patients, the nonoperative approach can be applied successfully, but the trauma surgeon must be very cautious. ","1356":"This is a prospective study to assess a complementary treatment for genital warts after laser vaporization. 62 patients were enrolled in two randomized groups: Al: laser vaporization alone. A2: laser vaporization, followed with Pidotimod plus vitamin C for 2 1\/2 months. The latter treatment shortened the time of warts remission and marginally decreased the rate of the warts' recurrence: 81% versus 67% (N.S.). Despite the non-significant difference, this complementary treatment seems to have some efficiency.","1357":"The aim of this article is to analyze the vascular dysfunctions occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). Vascular dysfunctions are common complications of SCI. Cardiovascular disturbances are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both acute and chronic stages of SCI. Neuroanatomy and physiology of autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic, is reviewed. SCI implies disruption of descendent pathways from central centers to spinal sympathetic neurons, originating in intermediolateral nuclei of T1-L2 cord segments. Loss of supraspinal control over sympathetic nervous system results in reduced overall sympathetic activity below the level of injury and unopposed parasympathetic outflow through intact vagal nerve. SCI associates significant vascular dysfunction. Spinal shock occurs during the acute phase following SCI and it is a transitory suspension of function and reflexes below the level of the injury. Neurogenic shock, part of spinal shock, consists of severe arterial hypotension and bradycardia. Autonomic dysreflexia appears during the chronic phase, after spinal shock resolution, and it is a life-threatening syndrome of massive imbalanced reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in patients with SCI above the splanchnic sympathetic outflow (T5-T6). Arterial hypotension with orthostatic hypotension occurs in both acute and chronic phases. The etiology is multifactorial. We described a few factors influencing the orthostatic hypotension occurrence in SCI: sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, low plasma catecholamine levels, rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity, peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor hyperresponsiveness, impaired function of baroreceptors, hyponatremia and low plasmatic volume, cardiovascular deconditioning, morphologic changes in sympathetic neurons, plasticity within spinal circuits, and motor deficit leading to loss of skeletal muscle pumping activity. Additional associated cardiovascular concerns in SCI, such as deep vein thrombosis and long-term risk for coronary heart disease and systemic atherosclerosis are also described. Proper prophylaxis, including non-pharmacologic and pharmacological strategies, diminishes the occurrence of the vascular dysfunction following SCI. Each vascular disturbance requires a specific treatment.","1358":"The last two decades have come up with some important progresses in the genetic, immune, histochemical and bio (nano)-technological domains, that have provided new insight into cellular\/molecular mechanisms, occurring in the central nervous system (CNS)--including in spinal cord-injuries. In previous works, emerging from our theoretical and practical endeavors in the field, we have thoroughly described the principal intimate propensity and the pathophysiological processes--representing intrinsic limitations for self-recovery after SCI, and, at the same time, subtle targets for neuroprotection\/recovery--and reviewed the main related worldwide-published reports. The aim of this paper is to emphasize the connections between such main aspects and some feasible integrative solutions, including the ones for clinical practice. Consequently, we stress upon some therapeutic suggestions regarding this subject matter by systematizing the most up to date and efficient ones--obviously, within major limits, according to the very low capacities of CNS\/ spinal cord (SC) to post-injury self preserve and recover. Moreover, we also talk about accessible drugs, respectively those being already in clinical use (but at present, mainly used to treat other conditions, including the neurological ones) and hence, with relatively well known, determined effects and\/or respectively, restrictions. The recent advances in the knowledge on the basic components of the afore mentioned CNS\/ SC propensity for self destroying and inefficient endogenous repair mechanisms in the actual new context, will hopefully be, from now on, more effectively correlated with revolutionary--mostly still experimental--treatments, especially by using stem cells within tissue engineering, including, if needed, more advanced\/courageous approaches, based on somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This paper contains the scientific motivated highlighting of some already available drugs, \"neuroprotective\" (and not only) properties too, which enable practitioners with (although not yet capable to cure--but anyway) more efficient therapeutic means, to approach the extremely difficult and still painfully disappointing domain, of spinal cord injury (SCI). ","1359":"The aim of this article is to analyze the effects of the molecular basis of vascular events following spinal cord injury and their contribution in pathogenesis. First of all, we reviewed the anatomy of spinal cord vessels. The pathophysiology of spinal cord injuries revealed two types of pathogenic mechanisms. The primary event, the mechanic trauma, results in a disruption of neural and vascular structures into the spinal cord. It is followed by secondary pathogenesis that leads to the progression of the initial lesion. We reviewed vascular responses following spinal cord injury, focusing on both primary and secondary events. The intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a direct consequence of trauma; it has a typical pattem of distribution into the contused spinal cord, inside the gray matter and, it is radially extended into the white matter. The intraparenchymal hemorrhage is restricted to the dorsal columns, into adjacent rostral and caudal spinal segments. Distribution of chronic lesions overlaps the pattern of the early intraparenchymal hemorrhage. We described the mechanisms of action, role, induction and distribution of the heme oxygenase isoenzymes 1 and 2. Posttraumatic inflammatory response contributes to secondary pathogenesis. We analyzed the types of cells participating in the inflammatory response, the moment of appearance after the injury, the decrease in number, and the nature of their actions. The disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier is biphasic. It exposes the spinal cord to inflammatory cells and to toxic effects of other molecules. Endothelin 1 mediates oxidative stress into the spinal cord through the modulation of spinal cord blood flow. The role of matrix metalloproteinases in blood-spinal cord barrier disruption, inflammation, and angiogenesis are reviewed.","1360":"It is frequently recognized in medical literature as well as in daily clinical practice that right ventricular myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism are two of the most challenging clinical pictures to differentiate in cardiology and the treatment, often chosen upon a mixture of clinical suspicion criteria subsequently confirmed by other diagnostic methods, can lead to therapeutic success. Differential diagnosis is often difficult due to similar clinical picture, unspecific electrocardiographic changes and unspecific biological markers. It is very important to know the risk factors and the associated comorbidities for these two clinical entities in order to be able to interpret them contextually. In most cases the diagnosis key is the clinical suspicion. Usually in evaluating these cases we are in the position of choosing more complex diagnostic procedures, most likely not available in Emergency Department. In conclusion it is expected from the clinician to use the available methods with a thorough approach to details but in the same time considering the whole clinical picture.","1361":"During the development of the neuronic and visceral cranium, an important number of factors, not only genetic, but also functional, led to the apparition of some different aspects of growing at the level of each section: the basis of the cranium, the basis of the maxillary, dental alveolus, dental arch. All these \"aggravating\" or \"compensatory\" changes are added to the level of the occlusion plan, leading to the establishment of the occlusion relations in the three plans. From now on, the occlusion will directly influence the development at the level of the above-described sections.","1362":"Although hypercoagulable states are most often associated with venous thromboses, arterial thromboses are reported in protein C, protein S, antithrombin deficient patients and in those with factor V Leiden, components of hereditary thrombophilia. Because these arterial thromboses (peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction) mostly affect young persons, aged below 45 years, it is important to test and treat these thrombophilic defects. Because the relation thrombophilia--arterial thromboses is still under debate, due to conflicting data, this article is a review of studies published in literature regarding the implication of the above-mentioned thrombophilic defects in cerebral infarcts.","1363":"The early diagnosis and detection of progression are two key-elements in the actual management of glaucoma. The current opinion in clinical practice is to quantify the structural damage for a better follow-up of the patient and the standardization of the results.

He is known for the psychological tool that bears his name, the Szondi test. He developed a form of depth psychology that had some prominence in Europe in the mid-20th century, but has been ignored for the most part), the study seeks to correlate the szondian test results with the imagistic ones on a wide-range pathology. In the Neurosurgery Department, patients are investigated using modern exploration methods (MRI, CTscan, and computed EEG, etc.) in order to identify possible somatic lesions. The study's subjects selected during 2000-2004 from the patients admitted and investigated for neurosurgical conditions; they were divided into two subgroups, based on whether the organic lesions were or were not present (the independent variable). The exclusion criterion was a lesion due to external causes. Statistically meaningful there are seven types of Ego profiles, in relation with the lesion: the archaic ego [0 -], the inhibited ego [- +], the adaptive ego [- -], the narcissist ego [+ +], the identified ego [+\/- 0], the fugitive ego [+\/- -] and the possessed ego [0 +]. The nexus in the destiny's analysis description highlights the dialectic between the Ego's functions and the drived dangers when facing the demands of the concrete reality.","1365":"With improvements in health care, more people survive stroke but many have to cope with the physical, psychological, social and functional sequelae, resulting in increased personal and public costs. Cerebral stroke causes a significant deterioration of the patient's functioning and worsening of her\/his quality of life. Long-term disability caused by stroke is a common problem in all countries and its incidence increases markedly with advancing age. The assessment of the Quality of Life could be as well the evaluator of sequelae of stroke as an indicator of the effectiveness of the post-stroke rehabilitation. In this review article, the contemporary state of art in assessment of the post-stroke Quality of Life has been presented. The emphasis was placed on participation in terms of personal factors and environmental factors of post-stroke persons and their caregivers.","1366":"The specificity of the emergency medical act strongly manifests itself on account of a wide series of psycho-traumatizing factors augmented both by the vulnerable situation of the patient and the paroxysmal state of the act. Also, it has been recognized that the physical solicitation and distress levels are the highest among all medical specialties, this being a valuable marker for establishing the quality of the medical act. We have surveyed a total of 4725 emergency medical workers with the MBI-HSS instrument, receiving 4693 valid surveys (99.32% response rate). Professional categories included Emergency Department doctors (M-EMD), ambulance doctors (M-AMB), ED doctors with field work in emergency and resuscitation (including mobile intensive care units and airborne intensive care units) (D-SMU), medical nurses in Emergency Departments (N-EMD), medical nurses in the ambulance service (N-AMB), ED medical nurses with field activity in emergency and resuscitation (N-SMU), ambulance drivers (DRV) and paramedic (EMT). The n values for every category of subjects and percentage of system coverage (table 3) shows that we have covered an estimated total of 29.94% of the Romanian emergency medical field workers. MBI-HSS results show a moderate to high level of occupational stress for the surveyed subjects. The average values for the three parameters, corresponding to the entire Romanian emergency medical field were 1.41 for EE, 0.99 for DP and 4.47 for PA (95% CI). Average results stratified by professional category show higher EE average values (v) for the M-SMU (v=2.01, 95%CI) and M-EMD (v=2.21, 95% CI) groups corresponding to higher DP values for the same groups (vM-EMD=1.41 and vM-SMU=1.22, 95% CI). PA values for these groups are below average, corresponding to an increased risk factor for high degrees of burnout. Calculated PA values are 4.30 for the M-EMD group and 4.20 for the M-SMU group. Of all surveyed groups, our study shows a high risk of burnout consisting of high emotional exhaustion (EE) and high depersonalization (DP) values for Emergency Department doctors, Emergency, and Resuscitation Service doctors (M-SMU). Possible explanations for this might be linked to high patient flow, Emergency Department crowding, long work hours and individual parameters such as coping mechanisms, social development and work environment. ","1367":"The International \"Balint\" Award for students, instituted by the Foundation for Psychosomatic and Social Medicine in honor of Michael and Enid Balint, has been a rising opportunity for Romanian medical and psychology students to achieve international fame. Romanian students have been among the winners of this award for the last 10 years, in competition with students from Ivy League and other illustrious universities. The \"Ascona model\" case presentation debates the psychological side of a medical case, while keeping in focus the diagnostic, pathology and treatment issues. This article focuses on explaining this type of case presentation in correlation with one of the papers submitted in the contest that has received this award in the 15th International Balint Congress. The exposed case is that of a 17-year-old boy presenting with apparent stupor encountered by an emergency mobile unit. The patient was suspected of substance abuse and overdose but these suspicions were denied by the clinical exam. Further encounters led to the conclusion that both the boy and his whole family needed psychotherapy counseling and were referred there with great success.","1368":"The development of bipolar resection using saline irrigation provided significant improvements in NMIBT treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a newly introduced endoscopic technique, the bipolar transurethral resection in saline-plasma vaporization of bladder tumors (TURis-PVBT). Between May and October 2009, 57 consecutive patients presenting papillary bladder tumors larger than 1 cm underwent TURis-PVBT and a 3 months follow-up. Initial tumor biopsy, followed by plasma vaporization of the tumor and biopsies of the tumoral bed were performed in all cases. Complementary treatment was applied according to risk indications. The follow-up protocol included abdominal ultrasonography, cytology and cystoscopy at 3 months. TURis-PVBT was successfully performed in all cases. Multiple tumors were found in 45.6% of the cases and 50.9% of the patients presented tumors larger than 3 cm. The mean tumoral volume was of 11 ml. The mean operative time was of 17 minutes, the mean hemoglobin decrease was of 0.4 g\/dl, the mean catheterization period was of 2.5 days and the mean hospital stay was of 3.5 days. The pathological exam diagnosed 57.9% pTa cases, 31.6% pT1 cases and 10.5% pT2 cases. No tumoral base biopsies were positive for malignancy. The recurrence rate at 3 months for the 51 NMIBT patients was of 15.7%. Orthotopic recurrent tumors were encountered in 5.9% of the cases. TURis-PVBT seems to represent a promising endoscopic treatment alternative for NMIBT patients, with good efficacy, reduced morbidity, fast postoperative recovery and satisfactory follow-up parameters. ","1369":"The complex of symptoms in pancreatic cancer is vague, which often delays presentation and diagnosis. Thrombophlebitis is an unusual presentation of pancreatic cancer, which appears more frequent in the cancer of the body and tail of the pancreas. We present a case of a 52-years-old woman who was admitted to the hospital for a superficial thrombophlebitis. At the abdomen ultrasound screening, multiple liver masses, relatively well defined, with a hypo-echoic center and a hyper-echoic periphery, were identified. The head of the pancreas was normal, the body and the tail could not be seen very well due to flatulence. After computed tomography, the diagnosis was \"Pancreatic tumor with multiple hepatic metastases (stage IV)\". After the histopathological examination, 1250 mg\/m2 of Gemcitabine was started on day 1 and 8 every 28 days, plus 100 mg\/day of Erlotinib (Tarceva), every day. At the end of the seventh month of treatment, the patient suffered an irreversible ischemic cardiac event. Superficial thrombophlebitis can be the initial manifestation of the pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine and erlotinib is now a FDA approved regimen for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. While the search for the best gemcitabine based backbone for advanced pancreatic cancer continues, studies of anti-angiogenic agents alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapy, should be undertaken, as they may improve overall survival in this group of poor prognosis patients. ","1370":"The laparoscopic approach of pediatric surgery emergencies represents a specific preoccupation in hospitals everywhere in the world. Nowadays, when confronted with this pathology, pediatric surgeons are able to apply certain well-defined therapeutic protocols, depending on the technical equipment at their disposal and their laparoscopic expertise and training. We hereby present some of the surgical pediatric emergencies that have been subjected to minimally invasive celioscopic techniques, in the Department of Pediatric Surgery \"Maria Sklodowska Curie\" Hospital, from August 1999 to July 2007. Out of 83 exploratory laparoscopies, 12 were performed for emergency pathology, other than acute appendicitis (in its various forms, including peritonitis) or acute cholecystitis. However, during the above-mentioned period, the number of therapeutic laparoscopies for emergencies has grown significantly (239 from a total of 663 laparoscopies), reflecting to a large extent the activity of a clinic with an emergency surgery profile. The authors conclude that exploratory laparoscopies in pediatric surgery emergencies are suited for surgical teams with a solid experience in celioscopy and a certain professional maturity, necessary to correctly appreciate the surgical and anesthetic risks involved by each individual case. It is not recommended that inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons embark on the \"adventure\" of this minimally invasive approach for this type of pathology. Only when the training and learning process is fully and correctly completed, specialists are offered the advantage of continuing a celioscopic exploration by performing a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure, even for a pediatric emergency case.","1371":"recently, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, can be treated by pancreatic islet allotransplantation. This retrospective study involves 137 patients from the Surgery Department of Colentina Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, in the July 2000 - July 2008 period, who underwent pancreatic resections, the number of patients who developed pancreatogenic diabetes and their selection for the pancreatic islet transplantation. After pancreatectomy, 70 patients are diagnosed with diabetes, and 42 with prediabetic stages (IFG and IGT). 61 of these had average glycemic excursions (MAGE) over the normal, and 31 of the 70 patients diagnosed with diabetes, presented hypoglycemic episodes during treatment. The present criteria of patient selection for pancreatic islets transplantation are limited and can be applied to a small number of patients. ","1372":"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, usually associated with a personal or family history of atopic diseases such as AD, allergic rhinitis or asthma that most commonly arise in childhood and present with elevated IgE serum in up to 85% of patients. The severity of AD is based on the extent of affected areas, itch intensity and appearance of skin lesions. Here, we present the case of a 21-year-old female patient with generalized erythematous eczematous skin lesions, flexural lichenifications accompanied by intense pruritus, painful fissures and erosions resulting from scratching. She also presented erythematous plaques with thin scales on the scalp. The patient had no personal or familial history of AD, allergic rhinitis or asthma and the onset of cutaneous symptoms presented severe exacerbation in the last 2 months of the last 3 years. The main laboratory findings were- high serum eosinofilia (2400\/microL) and very high total IgE serum (11449 UI\/L). The flare remission was induced with systemic treatment (corticotherapy, oral H1 antihistamines, and antibiotherapy) and topical therapy (UVB 311 nm, topical glucocorticoids and hydration). It is very important to recognize AD as a cause of erythroderma, especially in a patient with a late onset of the disease, in order to treat it promptly and to prevent ulterior recurrences, by educating the patient to have an adequate life style and to treat the recurrences at the very first symptoms.","1373":"Although endometriosis is a benign disorder, recent studies suggest that endometriosis could be viewed as a neoplastic process. The objective of this study is to explore the epidemiology of synchronous neoplasms (SPN) in women with severe endometriosis. The prevalence of SPN in cases with endometriotic ovarian cysts that underwent surgery at \"Lito\" Maternity Hospital of Athens and at Anticancer Institute of Bucharest was investigated. The review period was from the year 2000 to 2008. The medical records and pathology were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and stage of tumors. Five women with synchronous cancer of the genital tract were identified. All of our patients had a grade-I endometrioid carcinoma of the uterus (Ia in 3, Ib in 2). Myometrium was invaded in less than 1\/3, in 4 cases, and less than 1\/2 in one case. Similarly, 4 out of 5 ovarian cancers were endometrioid, while one was serum cystadenosarcoma. All of the ovarian malignancies were grade I (Ib in 3 and Ia in 2). The median diameter of the ovarian neoplasias was of 4.3 cm, as opposed to 4.5 cm that was the median diameter of all endometrioid cysts. When the larger ovarian malignant cyst in each patient was accounted, the median diameter was calculated as having 5.8 cm. Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have distinct clinical characteristics including younger age, premenopausal status, and nulliparity. This suggests that a hormonal \"field effect\" may account for the development of these simultaneous endometrioid cancers, supporting the theory of estrogen receptors. ","1374":"Salter Harris Fractures type, especially type I and II are treated by orthopedic reduction in the emergency room or operating room, under general anesthesia, followed by plaster immobilization. Neglected or incorrectly treated fractures, leading to malunion and radiocarpal subluxations which require surgical procedure. This paper proposes to evaluate the correctly applied orthopedic treatment and the expose of an original surgical technique in case of neglected and incorrectly treated fractures, leading to mal-unions and impediments in the radiocarpal mobility and aesthetics. we studied a group of 238 children with Salter Harris fractures type I and II, treated in \"M.S. Curie\" Emergency Hospital for Children, Bucharest. Out of the studied group, 200 children were treated by orthopedic reduction and immobilization in a plaster device. Malunions present within 38 children due to neglected or mistreated fractures, underwent open reduction with internal osteosynthesis by a technique that avoids violating the growth cartilage. This technique involves making an internal fixation with the radial joint surface in a normal position. Children receiving proper orthopedic reduction and immobilization in plaster device, 200 patients, were cured after 30-45 days of immobilization, depending on age and joint mobility which were within normal range. The 38 children with malunions underwent surgery to rectify the position of the radial joint surface. Postoperative results were good, proper position of the radiocarpal joint were made during the surgical procedure. The intemal fixation is ensured by a transepiphyseal wire and after 30 days of immobilization in a plaster device the patients started the recovery treatment. Radiocarpal joint mobility returned to normal after a variable period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the patient's age. Salter Harris I and II fractures are absolute indication for orthopedic treatment, in a matter of emergency, preferably in the operating room under general anesthesia. Verification is necessary between the 7th and 14th day after orthopedic reduction, to avoid malunions. Malunited fractures require surgical intervention after a special technique, avoiding damage to the growth cartilage and radial epiphysis. ","1375":"By establishing the renal suppletion procedure, the patients with chronic renal failure also have an acceleration of arterial hypertension phenomena. The management of this situation calls for the understanding of the ethological mechanisms (hypervolemia by the reduction of Na excretion and high rennin secretion) and the adaptation of the therapeutic approach to every patient. An individualized dialysis prescription is imposed, taking into account the residual renal function and an anti-hypertension treatment, in which the role of the conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitor) is intensely debated.","1376":"Achalasia is a rare idiopathic, primary esophageal motility disorder. Pharmacologic, endoscopic and surgical methods are used in its treatment. The efficiency of the treatment is generally based on clinical \"subjective\" criteria. Manometry, which is the gold standard in diagnostic and in treatment monitoring is not always available, it is costly and it needs expertise. The role of timed barium esophagogram in the evaluation of the patients before and after endoscopic dilation will be discussed in the article. This method is standardized, less costly, and has a good correlation with clinical and manometrical results.","1377":"The immune response consists of two main components: humoral immunity represented by B lymphocytes and cellular immunity maintained by the T lymphocytes. Immunoglobulins, produced by B-lymphocytes, are the main mediators of humoral immunity, and deficiencies at this level affect the body's response to infection. Plasmocytes produce nine antibody izotypes: immunoglobulins G (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), immunoglobulins M (IgM), immunoglobulins A (IgA1, IgA2), immunoglobulins D (IGD) and immunoglobulins E (IgE). Primary hypogammaglobulinemias are characterized by the occurrence of recurrent infections and, paradoxically, by the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. Characteristic for these diseases is that symptoms occur at 7-9 months after birth, when transplacental antibody titers transmitted from the mother decrease, and the infant's body is unable to synthesize them to normal levels. Primary hypogammaglobulinemias are transmitted genetically, but mutations at the molecular level are still not fully understood. The most common are: Bruton agammaglobulinemia, transient newborn hypogammaglobulinemia, selective immunoglobulin deficiency and variable common immunodeficiency. Treatment consists of monthly antibiotics and immunoglobulins, depending on antibody titers (except for IgA deficiency).","1378":"","1379":"Growth factors have represented an essential issue of interest for the researchers and clinicians in orthopedics and trauma over the last 40 years. In the last 10 to 15 years, the advances registered in this field have permitted the identification of the most active cellular and humoral factors as well as the improvement of their use in the orthopedic and trauma surgery. Their domain of application has been continuously enlarged and the results have been visible from the beginning. The authors present their appreciation on the actual state of this subject as well as their experience with results and related conclusions.","1380":"The posterior fossa arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is uncommon and different from other intracranial AVM in its natural history, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and other features. Authors present a review of the actual procedures of diagnosis and treatment in the field of infratentorial cerebral arterio-venous malformations, based on the actual literature data. Pre-therapeutic considerations, such as clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation, are initially discussed because they are crucial in choosing the optimal treatment. Posterior fossa AVMs merit multimodality intervention when feasible in most cases because of their higher risk of rupture and higher potential of morbidity and mortality. In addition, we present two significant cases treated in our department.","1381":"The aim of this study is to evaluate effective prognostic factors in the evolution of patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis and to establish the validity of fractal analysis in determining the disease severity in these patients. This study included 19 patients (M\/F: 5\/14) treated for idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral obstructive renal failure between Jan 2004-Dec 2008. Patients were identified retrospectively, searching for patients diagnosed with IRF, after retroperitoneal biopsy or, in most cases the diagnosis rested on radiological findings, especially CT, with identification of a retroperitoneal mass, the absence of other demonstrable renal or ureteric disease or any other pathology that could explain the findings. CT was very useful in describing the retroperitoneal mass around the aorta and inferior vena cava, the extent of the lesion and for monitoring the response to surgical treatment during the follow-up. The data were evaluated about medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory tests (serum urea and creatinine, blood sugar, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate levels, serum pH, uric acid, haematocrit, white blood cell count), imaging methods (renal ultrasound, abdominal CT-scan, MRI). At admission all patients had active disease with obstructive renal failure and underwent bilateral ureteric stenting in order to normalize the BUN levels. After normalizing of BUN levels, ureterolysis and omental wrapping was performed. Postoperatively, ureteric stents were removed after 1 month and remission of renal disfunction was obtained in approximately 5 months (range 2-10 months). All patients were followed for at least 1 year. Patients were regularly checked every 3 months. Of the 19 patients, there were 5 men and 14 women. The median age at diagnosis of RF was 50 years (range 42-64 years). The most frequent presenting symptoms were back or abdominal pain, weakness, weight loss, oligoanuria, arterial hypertension and mild fever. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from 6 to 18 months. At presentation all patients had active disease, presenting renal dysfunction with a median serum creatinine of 5.18 mg\/dl (range 1-15.4 mg\/dl). Most of the patients had moderate bilateral hydronephrosis (2nd degree hydronephrosis). In our study, all patients had excellent prognosis, with full recovery of renal function in 78% of cases (15 patients). The fractal dimension of the fibrosis mass contour correlates with level of renal function impairment. Even more, the fractal dimension seems to slightly variate between CT evaluations (1.30 +\/- 0.1), suggesting a non aggressive pattern of extension of the fibrotic mass characteristic for benign lesions. The imaging parameters did not predict the disease severity, except the increase in fractal dimension of fibrosis surface area. Efficacy of bilateral ureteric stenting in improving renal function is limited in most of the cases. Dispite the level of renal function impairment at admission, full recovery can be achieved after bilateral ureteric stenting\/nephrostomy and ureterolisis. ","1382":"Acute stress increases resistance to infection. The alteration of this mechanism in chronically stressed people impairs the organism's ability to mount a strong immune response with a resultant increase in morbidity. Acute stress induces a probable sympatho-adrenergically mediated increase in chemotaxis and adhesion molecules expression, thus promoting immune cells migration to sites of infection and\/or inflammation, while chronic stress impairs this mechanism. Protracted stressful conditions decrease NK cytotoxic capacity. There is a substance P, which under stressful circumstances mediates the increase in macrophage cytokine production. Acute stress increases T cell mobilization through a beta2-adrenergically mediated process, which is blunted during chronic stress. Psychological stress impairs the immune system's ability to produce antibodies in response to a vaccine, thereby making the organism more vulnerable to infections.","1383":"Currently, there is no cure for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Based on the available clinical and molecular findings, different therapeutic strategies were tested in vitro and in vivo and clinical trials are ongoing. The main therapeutic direction is focused on the enhancement of SMN expression by increasing the full-length (fl) SMN2 transcript levels, preventing the SMN exon 7 from skipping or from protein stabilizing. In addition, the action of neurotrophic, neuroprotective or anabolic agents is tested and stem cell and gene therapy approaches are in a promising development.","1384":"","1385":"Bipolar electrosurgical approach represents an increasingly acknowledged technology in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and a promising alternative to standard transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). In this study, we aimed to evaluate a new method, transurethral resection in saline - plasma vaporization of the prostate (TURIS-PVP), by determining its efficiency, safety and short-term postoperative results. In May 2009, TURIS-PVP was performed in 25 cases of BPH. The investigative protocol included digital rectal examination (DRE), prostatic specific antigen (PSA), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) score, maximum flow rate (Qmax) and abdominal ultrasonography assessing prostate volume and post-voiding residual urinary volume (RV). All patients were investigated 1 month after surgery using IPSS, QoL, Qmax and RV. TURIS-PVP was successfully performed in all cases. The average BPH size was 53 ml, the mean operating time was 28 minutes, the median catheterization time was 24 hours and the mean hospital stay was 48 hours. No patient required blood transfusions or re-catheterization, and there were no significant intra- or postoperative complications. Preoperatively, the mean value of IPSS was 21.4, the mean QoL score was 4, the mean RV was 72 ml and the mean Qmax was 9.7 ml\/s. The 1 month follow-up emphasized a mean IPSS of 4, a mean QoL score of 1.4, a mean RV of 14 ml and a mean Qmax of 21.5 ml\/s. TURIS-PVP represents a valuable endoscopic treatment alternative for patients with BPH, with good efficacy, reduced morbidity, satisfactory follow-up parameters and fast postoperative recovery. IPSS, QoL, Qmax and RV measurements showed significant improvements at the 1 month follow-up.","1386":"Thymoglobulin has a proven safety and efficacy profile both as treatment of acute rejection and as induction therapy in organ transplantation. The most common adverse events associated with Thymoglobulin are cytokine release syndrome, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia. Results of early studies showed an increased rate of cytomegalovirus disease associated with Thymoglobulin treatment, but recent studies indicate that routine administration of modern antiviral prophylaxis can reduce this risk. More research comparing Thymoglobulin with basiliximab will help individualize regimens by matching the choice of induction agent with the risk profile of each transplant recipient. The proven efficacy and safety profile of Thymoglobulin provides an excellent starting point for future investigations. Horse ATG (hATG) or Thymoglobulin + Cyclosporine are an efficacious treatment for aplastic anemia. Due to its higher potency Thymoglobulin may be superior to hATG, but further studies are required for confirmation. GvHD prophylaxis with Thymoglobulin may result in less acute and chronic GvHD, lower TRM, improved survival and quality of life in myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning protocols in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cells from related or unrelated donors. Attributable to its polyclonal nature, Thymoglobulin provides multifaceted immunomodulation suggesting that its use should be included in the immunosuppressant therapeutic armamentarium to help reduce the incidence of organ rejection and GvHD, and for treatment of aplastic anemia.","1387":"Knowing and applying standards is an opportunity of the years 2007-2008 in any kind of field where a successful activity is intended and this assures a certain way towards competence and quality. The most recent German studies highlighted, to the surprise of the specialists, that standardization holds the second place, after the material means, in the row of the elements considered to be decisive for the success of a business. The existence of standards and the concern for their implementation in the activity provides a high technical and quality level of the products\/services offered to the clients and the increase in the level of competence of the personnel, who will be able to cope with all the challenges. This need comes from the process of Romania's accession to the European Union. There are a lot of reasons why standards represent a fundamental part of our daily life. Practically, we are surrounded by standards. Everything is \"working\" well and it is efficient if the standards used as a base for manufacturing \"things\" have been correctly developed and applied. Standards open communication channels and commercial channels, promote the understanding of technical products, the compatibility of products and services, facilitate mass production and, most importantly, they are the necessary base for the achievement of the objectives in the fields of health and safety and a better quality of life. The transition towards the global market needs an instrument for the removal of the barriers to the application of the latest discoveries in the field of medical instruments, materials and manual labor. Each medical device, equipment and material used in the Dental and General Medicine is standardized, in fact that leads to their better knowing and provides controllable treatment for manual labor with predictable and repeatable results. This presentation intends to make a survey of some general aspects on standardization as well as a review of the standards in the medical area.","1388":"Despite the global effort to control the spread of HIV and AIDS, the number of HIV-infected people continues to increase worldwide. The failure of present prevention strategies, which rely principally on the modification of behavioral practices that put individuals at risk of getting the infection, and the lack of effective anti-HIV drugs have given an impetus to the search for a better way in the prevention and control of the epidemic. It was observed and scientifically documented that efforts related to prevention have to be adapted, constantly monitored and readapted in relation to results from periodical surveys. They also have to be well sustained over a sufficiently long period of time (years). Under these assumptions, in order to evaluate the knowledge and perception\/attitudes of the students in the University of Medicine, we developed a questionnaire that we presented for completion, for example, to medical students at the end of their first year of study. The gathered data conducted us to the assumption that information regarding HIV transmission is not yet internalized in order to determine specific practices, and attitudes are more related to perceptions and beliefs than to facts. An active, responsible, adult day to day responsibility could increase the protection against HIV transmission. A limitation of our study was represented by the reduced number of participants (96) and the lack of correlation between attitudes and knowledge, between students in different years of study and over time. It is our intention to continue this research and provide more complete data in the nearest future.","1389":"There is a tendency in current medical research to explore the importance and symptomatology of saliva. The question to which increasingly more researchers from the medico-legal, systemic and dental fields tried to answer and bring together arguments for a greater emphasis is referring to the role of saliva in the health of the patient. Up until our time, people have looked at the importance of saliva from another perspective: saliva helped in pasting envelopes or stamps, or mostly in reported cases of public speakers faced with the impossibility of having a coherent speech due to sensations of dry mouth. This 'dry mouth' condition, named xerostomia in medical terms, has been used since antiquity as a test in detecting lies, knowing since then that the inhibition of emotional salivary glands, the feeling of 'dry mouth' is caused by anxiety, thus being a potential incrimination. Although hundreds of publications have insisted on the etiology and complications of the salivary gland hypofunction, only a few health professionals used to harvest saliva tests. As in the case of urine and blood, saliva quality and quantity are affected by a multitude of medical conditions and treatments, as well as the patient's psychological state. A review of the formation, function and dysfunction of salivary glands may convey the significant role played by saliva in health and disease, especially in detection and recognition of salivary gland hypofunction, systemic disease, and the psychological states, and thus prevent complications caused by these conditions.","1390":"Traumatic spinal cord injury is a very comprehensive subject, debated in many scientific papers. It interests various medical specialties, but also other sciences, like economy, psychology or social science. The patient having a motoric disability, with sphincter troubles and other associated pathologies secondary to a traumatic lesion of the spinal cord, represented a social problem from the antiquity. The first centers dedicated exclusively to these patients were established during Napoleon. Nevertheless, a systematic approach to these patients was not possible before the end of the Second World War, when scientific and economic development made possible the establishment of medical facilities specialized in the complex evaluation and treatment of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Between the two world wars, physicians were concentrating their efforts to keep these patients alive, considering that the main target was to treat or prevent complications which could be fatal to the patient. The first scientific papers underlining the essential place of lower urinary tract disorders in the vital prognostic of the SCI patient are dating back to this time. In modern times, the target for every patient with SCI should be social reinsertion and obtaining as much autonomy as possible. The physician needs to tune up his treatment according to this factor. The continuous evolution of medicine, alongside with technical progress and the development of modern social security have created the premises for a real quality of life of the paraplegic or even quadriplegic patient. The lower urinary tract becomes not only a key for prolonged survival, but also one of the most important elements for social reinsertion.","1391":"The purpose of this article is to establish the important place of laparoscopy in the diagnosis management of pediatric surgery pathology. In addition, it is intended to become a pleading, concerning the true and realistic benefit, for the pediatric patient, of minimally invasive surgery. In our country, the method was taken over from general surgery and had a few years of latency in imposing itself. We consider that each pediatric surgeon is required to have a mandatory period of training in this topic. This is the reason why we appeal to the young generations of pediatric surgeons but also to the surgeons with many years of experience in classical surgical techniques, who are able to perfect the diagnostic and treatment methods in many medical specialties. The clinical research took place in a retro and prospective manner from August 1999 to July 2007 in the Department of Pediatric Surgery \"Maria Sklodowska Curie\" Hospital and studied 663 laparoscopic surgeries. 83 of them were exploratory laparoscopies (39 boys and 44 girls) and the other 580 were therapeutic procedures with accurate pre-operatory diagnostics. The surgical activity of our department concerning exploratory laparoscopy was also appreciated due to the decisional and therapeutic algorithms that were conceived. The motivations for exploratory laparoscopic procedures are multiple and arise from many causes, from right lower quadrant pain syndrome and abdominal tumors to congenital malformations and non-palpable testis. The processed data revealed the utility of laparoscopy, concerning most of the pediatric surgical pathologies and in the same time allowing them to continue the exploratory method of diagnosis with a minimally invasive therapy. The discrepancy between the exploratory benefit (sometimes minor) and the surgical trauma of an open exploratory surgery, explains the utility of laparoscopy that took over most of open surgery indications.","1392":"radical prostatectomy remains a real challenge for most of the urologists. Our study's objective is bringing into discussion the main aspects related to the technique we use, the intra and post-operatory complications, as well as the short-term analysis of the results in PC treatment using RP in the Prof. Dr. Th. Burghele Clinical Hospital - Clinic of Urology. between 1999 and 2007, 59 patients with PC, aged 48-74, were operated in our clinic. We began to recommend prostate biopsy (PB) to all patients with PSA higher than 4 ng\/ml and, in the last years, higher than 2,5 ng\/ml. A change in our attitude is related to the PB. At the beginning, we tried to perform \"targeted\" punctions, ultrasound guided especially in suspect zones, afterwards, we performed randomised punctions at all the patients, no matter the aspect of TRUS and we have increased the number of punctions accordingly to the prostate volume (minimum 6 punctions, maximum 12). The most used was the 10 core punction. The T classification, according to the clinical diagnosis, of the 59 operated patients: T1 cT1 a-b--4 cases; cT1 c--39 cases; T2 cT2 a--12 cases; cT2 b-c--4 cases. The RP surgical technique was the classic one, described by P.C. Walsh--the first surgical step, in all cases was lymphadenectomy. of all the patients that went through RP, 56 cases are still in our records. We can consider healed 24 patients with PC, followed for 3 years post-surgery, because they had no need of therapy and the PSA is maintained below 0.02 ng\/ml. The Gleason score--between the pre-operatory established diagnosis by punction and the anatomic-pathological examination of the piece, there were some differences: the concordance was in 48% of the cases; in 39% of the patients, the biopsy specimen had a lower Gleason score than the surgery specimen, and in 13% a higher score, the most common error was caused by sampling. The correlation between the pre-operatory evaluated clinical stage and the pathological clinical stage was of 57%. The most important late postoperative complications of RP were: urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In our study, we have recorded late postoperative: complete urinary incontinence in 4 cases (6.7%), erection was maintained after bilateral preservation of neurovascular bandelets in 90% of cases and after unilateral preservation in 71% of cases. Due to the short following period, we can't say if the operated patients by us had a benefit regarding the general surviving period; The personalized interpretation of the increase of serum PSA levels after surgery represents a possible problem regarding the indication of complementary treatment. ","1393":"The diabetic patients represent a population with a high risk of morbidity and mortality because of vascular complications. Out of them, all the patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction have a more reserved prognostic than those without diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the patients with impaired glucose tolerance have a more severe evolution in case of a myocardial infarction. We wondered about the progress of patients with myocardial infarction and high blood glucose levels in admittance who had not been previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. We took 128 patients (who did not have diabetes) with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction and divided them into three groups, according to the blood glucose level in admittance (&lt;140 mg\/dL, 140-200 mg\/dL and &gt; 200 mg\/dL); we also analyzed a group of diabetics with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted in the same period in our clinic. We made a prospective analysis over a period of 30 days. We evaluated the mortality at 30 days (as primary objective), as well as the extent of the infarction and the change of the left ventricle systolic function (secondary objectives). Both mortality and the mass of myocardial necrosis grew relative to the blood glucose level in admittance; instead, the ejection fraction varied inversely to the initial blood glucose level. The admittance blood glucose level represents a useful and available marker for the initial stratification of risks in patients with acute myocardial infarction, even in those undiagnosed with diabetes mellitus. ","1394":"Taking into account the great number of skin malignances that occur in the head and neck regions, problems related to their surgical treatment represent a constant concern for plastic surgeons. They have to deal with the difficulties of radical excision and also with reconstructive possibilities. More than 2\/3 of these malignances are basal cell carcinomas, which, if left untreated might become very invasive, surgical treatment being more difficult in such cases. Recurrent carcinomas combined with radiation injuries represent a serious challenge even for experienced surgeons regarding the size of the defect and anatomical structures involved. In this paper we present a case of a patient with basal cell carcinoma of the parietal region and the reconstructive treatment involving neurosurgery and plastic surgery team approach, using microsurgery techniques. We also present the difficulties of the case as well as the final outcome that we consider the best option for the patient. The neurosurgical stage consisted in fongus removal, excluding all brain tissue located outside the dural limits, craniectomy, duraplasty and cranioplasty. Because of the large size of the defect and also because the local resources were exhausted we chose as a covering solution the free tissue transfer consisting in a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. The difficulties of these cases consist both in the aim of radical excision and the limited reconstructive options. In this case, our collaboration with the neurosurgery team proved to be crucial, permitting us to solve this case in a single operative time, with deep excision, reconstruction of the dura mater and cranioplasty, and reconstruction of the soft tissues with microsurgical free transfer.","1395":"Soft tissue sarcomas are rare tumors representing 1% of all malignancies and less than 10% concerning head and neck tumors. We are presenting the case of a 42-year-old patient that was admitted in our service for a giant laterocervical tumor (15\/12\/10 cm). We performed total excision of this tumor en bloc with the involved tegument; the resulting defect was covered with a split thick skin graft. The weight of the tumor was 500 g. Histopathological examination revealed an intermediate-grade fibrosarcoma. The postoperative evolution was good; radiotherapy was indicated.","1396":"Atherosclerosis represents a systemic disease that affects all major vascular territories. Despite advances in medical therapies to prevent atherosclerosis and better manage patients with established peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the incidence of PAD continues to increase, and associated morbidity remains high, especially as the population ages. Over the past decade, percutaneous revascularization therapies for the treatment of patients with PAD have tremendously evolved, and a great number of patients can be offered treatment options that are less invasive than traditional surgical ones. Here we are presenting the case of a 67-year-old diabetic woman with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and oligosymptomatic atherosclerotic involvement in several important territories (severe internal carotid stenosis, severe proximal left subclavian artery stenosis, critical serial stenosis in the mid-segment of the left anterior descending artery). Bilateral staged carotid artery plus left subclavian artery stenting was performed with very good results. Regarding the existence of asymptomatic one vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with a negative exercise test our attitude was to maximize anti-ischemic medical therapy. In conclusion, the presence of multivascular atherosclerotic disease in a diabetic patient with coexisting risk factors is not surprising and it only reinforces the well known fact that we have to search for the involvement of other territories in an oligosymptomatic patient.","1397":"The article is debating a theme of great interest for the defect of the abdominal wall surgery--the use of biocompatible prosthesis. The surgeon is often confused by the avalanche of offers made by the mesh producers, making it mandatory for him to know very well the behavior of these alloplastic structures in the tissue environment. From this point of view, we have discussed both the physicochemical properties and the histological reaction brought by the most common type of meshes: polypropylene, polyethylene - tereftalat, polytetrafluorideethylene. This presentation brings out the minimal but mandatory criteria for any mesh to be accepted, but also the criteria that need to be taken into consideration when we try to improve the qualities of the mesh closer to the desideratum of the \"ideal mesh\". The main conclusion of this review is that we have to change the myth of the \"ideal mesh\" with \"the right chosen mesh\", that based on its chemical, physical, structural and biological qualities will adapt perfectly first to the patient's needs and second to the surgeon's needs.","1398":"The reflux of the gastric juice in the esophagus can determine the injury of the esophageal epithelium. When the healing of the lesion is done by replacing the normal squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium, the entity is called Barrett's esophagus (BE). Although controversial, some studies showed 0,5% per year the incidence of the esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with BE, 30 times more often than general population. Taking into consideration the possible development of an adenocarcinoma, the patients with Barrett's esophagus require endoscopic surveillance after a standardized protocol. There is still much controversy about the treatment of patients with Barrett's esophagus, especially in the presence of dysplasia. The aims of the treatment are gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms control, healing of associated esophagitis and prevention of development of adenocarcinoma.","1399":"","1400":"Bipolar transurethral resection (TUR) has been introduced in the clinical practice nowadays. Benefits from bipolar TUR are represented by the use of saline irrigation, which avoids hypoosmotic hyperhydration (TUR-Syndrome), as well as by the reduced risk of obturator nerve stimulation. However, the previously introduced smaller bipolar resection loop caused prolonged operating-time. We report our initial experience with a newly developed regular sized loop for a bipolar resectoscope. Different loop calibers and configurations were tested and compared to a previously introduced bipolar system and conventional resection devices in TUR of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and bladder tumors (TURP and TURBT). The resected tissue was pathologically examined for thermal damage and compared to a control group of monopolar conventionally resected tissue. The handling of the resectoscope was comparable to that of the conventional ones. Cutting control, cutting speed and coagulation effectiveness were excellent, and no obturator nerve stimulation occurred. The resection area could easily be assessed and tissue examination showed no differences in terms of quality and quantity of thermal damages, since tissue carbonization was reduced. There was no sticking of the resected tissue on the loop. Regular sized loop bipolar resection is safe and efficient. Coagulation and cutting extent control seem superior to conventional TUR. Due to reduced carbonization, the resection ground can be easily assessed. The risk of obturator nerve stimulation is reduced. The histological quality of the tissue is not impaired. This device combines the advantage of a regular size resection loop with bipolar resection in normal saline. It has the potential to become a valuable alternative to monopolar TUR. ","1401":"Psychiatric symptoms have been reported quite frequently in certain thyroid diseases, but more frequently in association with hypothyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis can be associated with various psychiatric symptoms, such as emotional lability, anxiety, restlessness and rarely frank psychosis. Psychotic symptoms in the context of hyperthyroidism typically present as an affective psychosis. The link between psychosis and hyperthyroidism is poorly understood. Because of this association of psychiatric symptoms is important to exclude a somatic cause, when assessing a patient first. We present the case of young woman who was followed over 2 years and who initially presented to psychiatric consultation for depressive symptoms, after being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and specific therapy instituted, but who developed psychotic symptoms.","1402":"We report the case of a 55-year-old man, hypertensive, who presented to the Emergency Room with intense occipital cephaleea, nausea, vomiting and disturbance of balance. The peculiarity of this case was given by the simultaneous presence of two brain hemorrhagic lesions and an unusual hypodensity with digitiform borders at cerebral CT scan, which suggested a different etiology than hypertension and leaded us to further investigations, which confirmed the diagnosis of lung cancer with multiple brain metastases.","1403":"The aim of this study is the evaluation of laparoscopic treatment in abdominal complications following ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. We report a retrospective study including 17 patients with abdominal complications secondary to VP shunt for hydrocephalus, laparoscopically treated in our department, between 2000 and 2007. Patients' age ranged from 1 to 72 years old (mean age 25.8 years old). Male: female ratio was 1.4. Abdominal complications encountered were: shunt disconnection with intraperitoneal distal catheter migration 47.05% (8\/17), infections 23.52% (4\/17) such as abscesses and peritonitis, pseudocysts 11.76% (2\/17), CSF ascites 5.88% (1\/17), inguinal hernia 5.88% (1\/17), and shunt malfunction due to excessive length of intraperitoneal tube 5.88% (1\/17). Free-disease interval varies from 1 day to 21 years, depending on the type of complication, short in peritoneal irritation syndrome and abscesses (days) and long in ascites, pseudocysts (months-years). Laparoscopic treatment was: extraction of the foreign body in shunt disconnection with intraperitoneal distal catheter migration, evacuation, debridement, lavage and drainage for pseudocysts, abscess and peritonitis, shortening of the tube in shunt malfunction due to excessive length of intraperitoneal tube and hemioraphy. One diagnostic laparoscopy was performed in a peritoneal irritation syndrome, which found only CSF ascites. There were no conversions to open surgery. The overall mortality was of 5.88% and postoperative morbidity was of 11.76%. In 7 patients operated for abscesses, peritonitis, pseudocysts, and CSF ascites the shunting system was converted in to a ventriculocardiac shunt. Abdominal complication following VP shunt can be successfully performed laparoscopically. Abdominal surgery required, in selected cases, the repositioning of the distal catheter, frequently as a ventriculocardiac shunt. There are abdominal complications with no indication of surgery, like peritoneal irritation syndrome and CSF ascites. Free-disease interval varies from days (peritoneal irritation syndrome, abscesses) to month-years (pseudocyst, ascites), according to type of complication. ","1404":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with loss of overall functionality of the locomotion system and it is connected with substantial economic losses. To describe the clinical characteristics and healthcare resource utilization characteristics and to analyze the correlations in a cross-sectional sample of 206 patients in Romania. RA cases have been enrolled from southern and western part of the country, covering a surface of 23 counties. Particularly in the literature data, Romanian RA patients become work disabled at 5.65 +\/- 5.99 years old after the diagnosis. At cohort level, retirement in the first year after RA diagnosis is of 22.9%. From those, 13% were treated with biologic DMARDs; those on non-biologic DMARDs were 28.6%. In oral therapy group the most prescribed drug is lefunomide (61.2%). RA has an important impact on pain, function and utility, influenced by social factors. Patients' follow up is often based on hospitalization. Currently, when the clinician may choose for one certain therapy or another, the social influence is still overwhelming at all the evaluation levels in RA patients, as well as at economic impact. ","1405":"Congenital heart diseases are broadly defined as those cardiac anomalies that are present at birth. By their very nature, such defects have their origin in embryonic development. Congenital mitral valve regurgitation is a rare disease occurring in infancy or childhood. In up to 60% of cases, congenital anomalies of the mitral valve occur in association with other cardiac lesions, and often more than one component of the mitral apparatus is involved. The true incidence of congenital mitral valve regurgitation (MVR) is difficult to determine accurately (0.21-0.42% from total mitral valve regurgitations); isolated congenital mitral regurgitation is uncommon. The Carpentier classification of congenital mitral valve disease is the most commonly used nomenclature based on a functional analysis of the mitral valve leaflet. The contemporary anatomic classification has the advantage of minimizing observer variability in the diagnosis and it offers a much better liaison between the cardiologist and surgeon.","1406":"The prognosis and clinical management of chronic liver diseases are highly dependent on the extent of liver fibrosis. Bigger the fibrosis, worse the prognosis; and bigger the risk of progression to cirrhosis. In current practice, liver biopsy is most frequently performed to assess the grade of inflammation and stage of fibrosis thereby providing prognostic information on which to base treatment decisions upon. Liver biopsy is becoming more and more useless in the management of chronic liver disease due to large sampling error, consistent inter-observer disagreement, high emotional cost of patient, enormous health care commitment in case of rare but possible severe complications, the fact that it is a snapshot of a process that is everything but a frozen one. Therefore, every methodology that avoids performing this invasive procedure is welcome. The purpose of this article is to present the noninvasive evaluation of patients with chronic liver disease as an alternative of liver biopsy in the assessment of hepatic structure and function.","1407":"During the last decades, erectile dysfunction was considered a direct consequence of aging and, although of a great concern for the affected patient, little was available to evaluate and treat this problem. If aging could not be invoked in all cases, than the psychogenic etiology was the only explanation. Over the coming years, a better understanding of the physiology involved in the penile process of tumescence and detumescence has allowed for better approach of each disease asociated with erectile dysfunction so that adequate treatment modalities can be applied to the pacient. As we all know, every pacient is a particular case. The development of modern PDE-5 inhibiters, along with other more or less invasive therapies, puts a new light on the medical approach of ED.","1408":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or astrocytoma grade IV on WHO classification is the most aggressive and the most frequent of all primary brain tumors. Glioblastoma is multiforme, resistant to therapeutic interventions illustrating the heterogeneity exhibited by this tumor in its every aspect, including clinical presentation, pathology, genetic signature. Current data and treatment strategy in GBM are presented focusing on basic science data and key clinical aspects like surgery, including personal experience; adjuvant modalities: radiotherapy, chemotherapy, but also for experimental approaches. Therapeutic attitude in recurrent GBM is also widely discussed.","1409":"From a historical point of view, medicine (in modem society) has set its mission as to cure diseases--medical-type issues--and to ignore patient's condition--illness endurance. By accepting this point of view with reference to their problem, patients have entered some sort of conspiracy of silence and started ignoring the emotional reaction to their medical problems (or to cancel these reactions), regarding them as irrelevant to the problem itself. This approach is also reinforced by the medical pattern that absolutely contests the idea that mind influences the body in a very important way. Another equally unproductive ideology is the idea that people could cure themselves alone even of the most serious illnesses by feeling happy or by thinking in a positive manner, or the idea that people are guilty of getting sick. This attitude resulted in creating a widespread confusion and in significant misunderstandings regarding the extent to which illness can be influenced by mind, at times even blaming someone for having got ill. In the world of illness, emotions have supremacy and fear is the only \"thought\". We can be so fragile emotionally speaking when we suffer from some illness because part of our mental good-humor is partially based on the illusion of invulnerability. Illness--especially a severe one--destroys this illusion and cancels the premise that our world is one in which existence is completely secure. All of a sudden, we feel thick with weaknesses, we feel helpless and vulnerable (Dixon, 1992). There is a problem when the medical personnel ignore the way patients react from an emotional point of view, even though they should exclusively take care of our physical state. This lack of interest in the emotional reality of an illness neglects something obvious which shows that the emotional state of people can play a significant role as to their vulnerability towards illness and during the recovery process (Ciofu et al., 1978). There is already a scientific basis according to which a limit to the medical efficiency appears not only during the prophylactic process but also during treatment. This efficiency can be enhanced by curing the emotional state of the patient at the same time with his\/her medical state. Unfortunately, too often, the medical personnel is in a hurry or unsympathetic towards patients' despair and, seemingly, things get worse indeed in the midst of the medical system harsh reality, medical system that depends too much on time keeping performed by accountants (Ciurea et al., 2009).","1410":"Cervical cancer lesions represent a major threat to the health of the women worldwide. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for 99.7% of cervical cancer cases, the infectious etiology giving the possibility of preventing cervical cancer by vaccination. The most aggressive HPV types are 16 and 18, which cause about 70% of cases of invasive cancer. The vaccination is recommended to the girls aged 11-12. The diagnosis and the treatment of cervical preinvasive disease allow the doctor to prevent the development of the invasive disease.","1411":"Electrocardiograms in elite endurance athletes sometimes show bizarre patterns suggestive of inherited channelopathies (Brugada syndrome, long QTc, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) and cardiomyopathies (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) responsible for unexpected sudden cardiac death. Among other methods, genetic analyses are required for correct diagnosis. To correlate 12-lead electrocardiographic patterns suggestive of inherited channelopathies and cardiomyopathies to specific genetic analyses. Prospective study (2004-2007) of screening 12-lead ECG tracings in standard position and higher intercostal spaces V1 to V3 precordial leads, performed in athletes and normal sedentary subjects aged match. Genetic analyses of subjects with ECG abnormalities suggested inherited channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. All cardiologic exams and electrocardiograms were performed at \"Prof. Dr. C.C. Iliescu\" National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Bucharest, Romania). The genetic studies were done at \"Mina Minovici\" National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Bucharest, Romania). 347 elite endurance athletes (seniors--190, juniors--157), mean age of 20; 200 subjects mean age of 21, belonging to the control group of 505 normal sedentary population. Seniors. RSR' (V1 to V3) pattern, in 45 cases (23.68%), 5 of them with questionable Brugada sign (elevated J wave and \"coved\" ST segment, &lt; 2 mm in one lead, V1. Typically, Brugada 1 sign was found in one case (0.52%) with no SCN5A abnormalities. One athlete (0.52%) had normal ECG and exon1 SCN5A duplication. MRI confirmed three arrhythmic right ventricular cardiomypathy epsilon waves (1.57%), in one case. ST-segment elevation myocardial injury like in V1-V3 precordial leads in 34 athletes (17.89%). Genetic analyses-no gene mutations. Juniors. Upright J wave was found in 43 cases (27.38%). Convex ST segment elevation in V1-V3\/V4, in 39 cases (24.84%). Bifid T wave with two distinct peaks was found in 39 cases (24.84%), 5 of them with mild prolonged QTc (0.48\"-0.56\") and KCN genes mutations. Nine (5.73%) of the elevated ST segment juniors had questionable Brugada sign, two of which with KCN (n=1) and SCN5A (n=1) gene mutations. Ajmaline provocative test was negative in 4 and was refused by 5 subjects. Bizarre QRS, ST-T patterns suggestive of abnormal impulse conduction in the right ventricle, including the right outflow tract, associated with prolonged QTc interval in some cases were observed in highly trained endurance athletes. The genetic analyses, negative in most athletes, identified surprising mutations in SCN5A and KCN genes in some cases. ","1412":"Discovery of neurotrophic factors--emblematic: the nerve growth factor (NGF)--resulted in better approaching central nervous system (CNS) lesions. Recently, another crucial property has been unveiled: their rather unique pleiotropic effect. Cerebrolysin is a peptide mixture that penetrates the blood-brain barrier in significant amounts and mimics the effects of NGF. Comparative analysis: Cerebrolysin treated (10 ml x 2\/day, i.v. x 3 weeks) vs. non-treated, in patients (all received aside, a rather equivalent complementary, pharmacological and physical, therapy). Two lots of patients, admitted in our Physical &amp; Rehabilitation (neural-muscular) Medical-PR(n-m)M-Clinic Division, during 2007-2009: 69 treated with Cerebrolysin (22 F, 47 M; Average: 59.333; Mean of age: 61.0 Years old; Standard deviation 16.583) and 70 controls (41 F, 29 M; A: 70.014; M.o.a.: 70.5 Y.o.; S.d.: 6.270) were studied. The total number of assessed items was 13: most contributive in relation with the score of Functional Independence Measure at discharge (d FIM), were: admission (a FIM), number of physical therapy days (PT), number of hospitalization days (H), age (A) and--relatively--days until the first knee functional extension (KE). Concomitantly, the main\/key, focused on neuro-motor rehabilitative outcomes, functional\/analytical parameters, have been assessed regarding the speed in achieving their functional recovery. Concerning d FIM, there have not been objectified significant differences between the two lots (p=0.2453) but regarding key, focused on neuro-motor rehabilitative outcomes, functional\/analytical parameters: KE (p=0.0007) and days until the first time recovery of the ability to walk between parallel bars (WPB--p=0.0000)--highly significant differences in favor of Cerebrolysin lot resulted. Cerebrolysin administration, as neurorehabilitative outcomes, proved to hasten, statistically significant, especially the recovery of some critical, for standing and walking, parameters. Thus encouraged, we have now initiated a comprehensive national, 5 year retrospective, multi-centre--based on unitary data acquisition frame and mathematical apparatus--study, to evaluate the results of the treatment with Cerebrolysin in traumatic brain injuries (TBI). ","1413":"In an evolutionary model, health and disease are regarded as successful and respectively failed adaptation to the demands of the environment. The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and\/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.","1414":"Histological evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) exceeded 50% in men over 50 years of age and rose to 75% as men entered the eighth decade. Therapeutic options for BPH generally fall into one of the three categories: watchful waiting, medical treatment and surgery. Excluding watchful waiting, the other forms of intervention directed at modifying the physiologic effects of BPH with or without directly altering the prostatic mass or its configuration come with varying effectiveness and risk. Botulinum toxin (BTX-A) produce inhibition of acethylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction causes paralyzing effects and atrophy of striated as well as the smooth muscle fiber. BTX-A also causes inhibitory effects on the ganglionic and post-ganglionic fibres of autonomic nervous system inducing diffuse atrophy and apoptosis of nasal and prostate glands. Clinical series demonstrates efficacy of BTX-A in alleviating symptoms induced by BPH. Larger randomized clinical trials studies are necessary in order to identify the mechanisms by which BTX-A affects the prostate, the ideal dose and the duration of effect. BTX-A injected into prostate appears safe and effective.","1415":"Urachus diseases represent a relatively rare kind of affliction in child or adult abdominal or urological surgical pathology. The preservation of the urachus lumen leads to rare afflictions, noticed mostly after birth or when they become clinically manifest by various complications. More often than not, these pathological entities require surgical interventions (if the urachal lumen does not close by itself), consisting of partial or total excision of the urachus. Tumor pathology is mostly malign, to a large extent represented by urachus adenocarcinoma. Its initial symptomatology is scarce and confusing. Its treatment is mainly by surgery and consists of the surgical excision of the urachal ligament, of the umbilicus, of a part of the front abdominal wall and partial or total cystectomy, as necessary. The prognosis is unfavourable, since urachal adenocarcinoma is deemed to be a particularly aggressive tumor, strongly influenced by the status of the excision edges, that is by the radicalness of the surgical intervention. Irrespective of the latter, an adjuvant oncological treatment is to be prescribed, mainly systemic cytostatic therapy. Urachus adenocarcinoma is rarely encountered and very often diagnosed in late metastatic stages, when the only solution is at most paleative surgery.","1416":"Successful advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis rely on enrolment of patients into clinical trials with novel agents. The aim of this study was to assess the patients' perspectives and motivators to participate in clinical trials. Consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis attending three rheumatology departments in Romania underwent structured questionnaire interview regarding the motivation\/possible causes of acceptance or drawbacks to participate in a clinical trial. A total of 96 patients, mean age 48, 30% men 70% women answered. Response rate was 95%. Previous participation in other clinical trials was 23%. Patients were highly motivated to participate in order to help themselves or other patients and to enhance the knowledge about the disease. Patients were prone to ask for advice about their enrolment in the study from the family and their current physicians, including the general practitioner. The need for supplementary information about the study was felt because they had not dared to ask for the information, although they trusted their current doctor. A high percentage considered payment and free complete blood tests as a stimulus, especially among patients with lower levels of education (p = 0.03, Fisher's ANOVA). Advertising for investigational medical product for purposes of patient recruitment was important for 57%, not only for safety or trust, but also for transparency and as a tool to get information. 73% of the persons agreed to the usefulness of patients association. 26% of them were willing to be actively involved, especially to report and include adverse events in the study settings. 58% were motivated if they knew other patients were consulted. Patients were not motivated because of the adverse events, placebo effect, treatment discontinuation, limited previous experience, availability of alternative therapies and doctor reimbursement for the study. The current study suggests that awareness of factors (positive and negative) which influence motivation to participate in a clinical trial may help to refine patient's education and to consider new strategies for future trials. ","1417":"The aim of our study was to determine the importance of p53, PCNA and Ki-67, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, in the treatment and prediction of the laryngeal carcinoma. Out of a total of 319 patients with laryngeal carcinoma that underwent surgery in our department between 1999 and 2007, we performed a retrospective study on 71 cases who benefited by immunohistochemical guidance before the beginning of the treatment. All these patients have been followed-up two to five years after surgery. The values of p53, PCNA and Ki-67 are strongly correlated with the histological grading, by means of descriptive statistics (confidence level 95%); the mean values of these three markers corresponding to each HP grade. A highly statistical significant positive correlation (r = 0.84, p &lt; 0.001 ) between the values of p53 and PCNA was observed. The values of p53, PCNA and Ki-67 in the patients from this study are strongly correlated with the absence of the loco-regional lymph node metastases, by means of descriptive statistics (confidence level 95%). Ki-67 only is correlated significantly to the presence of lymphatic metastases in the regional lymph nodes (stage N1, N2 or N3 TNM). P53 and PCNA are not correlated significantly with the presence of the metastases in the regional lymph nodes.","1418":"Immunity plays an important role in the prognosis and the natural development of cancer. Previous studies have shown that the presence of tumor in the body could modify the immune response leading to immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunological changes of patients with larynx squamous cell carcinoma undergoing potentially curative surgery. We assessed the serum levels of cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF), chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha) and growth factors (VEGF and bFGF) in laryngeal cancer patients before, during and after surgery. We have used a novel multianalyte XMap profiling technology that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters in small volumes of samples. To investigate the changes in immune mediators' profile induced by tumor resection, we assessed the culture supernatants of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from the patients, before and after surgery. The results suggested a predominance of a Th2 type of immune response associated with the presence of the tumor (especially in the case of heavy smokers who smoke more than 40 pack-years). However, shifts towards a Th1 type of immune response as well as an improvement of monocyte functions were noticed after surgery.","1419":"TB incidence in our country is still quite high compared to the average of the European Union countries (1st place among EU countries and 3rd place among WHO European Region countries), which means that a national coordinated response against this disease needs to become the priority of the current health care policy. The multi-factorial conditioning, which includes the social and economic dimensions of TB spreading, requires a multi-disciplinary and inter-sectorial approach to this pathology, going beyond healthcare services. The National Tuberculosis Control Strategy is a part of Romania's Country Strategy based on the guidelines set out in WHO's 2006-2015 Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis (MDGs 2015) and it provides the necessary framework for refining and harmonizing the national legislation and regulations with the European laws after Romania's integration in the EU.","1420":"In the last decade, many researches have reached to the conclusion that preservation of residual renal function (RRF) is important after initiating dialysis, as well as in the predialysis period. RRF has been proven to contribue to the quality of life of dialysis patients. Longer preservation of RRF provides a better small and middle molecule removal, improved volemic status and arterial pressure control, diminished risk of vascular and valvular calcification due to better phosphate removal. Deterioration of RRF results in worsening of anemia, inflammation and malnutrition. It is now proven a direct relationship between RRF value and survival in dialysis patient. Several therapeutical intervention have been proven to ameliorate the decline of RRF in dialysis patients. Some of them are identical with those before initiating dialysis: ACE-inhibitors and\/or angiotensin-receptor blockers, limiting the use of nephrotoxic drugs, avoiding contrast media procedures, adequate control of blood pressure. Others are specific for dialysis period: adequate dialysis dose, avoiding excessive ultrafiltration, preventing arterial hypotension during dialysis sessions, using biocompatible dialysis membranes, ultrapure water for dialysis, dietary interventions.","1421":"Not long ago it was believed that the human olfactory sense had a low importance, a vision which turned into the exploration of the environment. Recent studies have shown that, despite the weak representation of the olfactory receptor common in other species too, the cortical areas of integration of the olfactory sensations are very large and have important interconnections with memory, language, and neuro-vegetative areas. In humans, olfaction has a small contribution in identifying objects or other people, but plays an important social and emotional part. People learn to love or to hate certain foods or objects only by appreciating their odor and this proved to be a very important economic factor. The most significant role of olfactory signals in humans appears to be the modulation of their behavior and interpersonal relationships, of their affiliation to certain groups or social classes, having a major influence in their tastes and personality. signal that will be sent to the specialized areas in their tastes and personality.","1422":"Traumatic epidural hematoma (EDH) represents a rare head injury complication in infants. Its diagnosis can be quite challenging because its clinical presentation is usually subtle and nonspecific. Authors present a study on 30 infants with epidural hematoma (EDH) admitted in the Pediatric Department of Neurosurgery of the \"Bagdasar-Arseni\" Clinical Hospital in the period of 1990-2007 (17 years). The most common symptom was irritability, which occurred in 16 cases (53.3%), of our patients. Pallor in all cases (100%) and subgaleal hematoma in 20\/30 (66.6%) of the patients. These were the most common clinical signs that occurred upon admission; both of them represent signs of significant clinical importance. Surgical evacuation via craniotomy was required in 26\/30 (86.6%) of our patients, while 4\/30 (13.3%) of the patients were managed conservatively. The mortality rate was 6.6% in our series, whilst the long-term morbidity rate was 3.3%. EDH in infants represents a life-threatening complication of head injury, which requires early identification and prompt surgical or conservative management depending on the patient's clinical condition, the size of EDH, and the presence ofa midline structure shift on the head's CT scan.","1423":"Hexaminolevulinate blue light cystoscopy (HAL-BLC) represents an increasingly acknowledged method in bladder cancer diagnostic. We aimed to evaluate the importance of this procedure in cases of non-invasive bladder tumors (NIBT), to compare it with standard white light cystoscopy (WLC), and to establish the efficiency of blue light transurethral bladder resection (BL-TURB). Between December 2007 and December 2008, WLC and BLC were performed in 70 cases. WL-TURB was performed for all lesions visible in WL, and BL-TURB for those only detected in BL. Patients diagnosed with NIBT were followed-up after an average period of 5 months (between 18 and 22 weeks) by WLC and BLC. The control group included the same number of consecutive cases of NIBT, which underwent only WLC and WL-TURB, as well as the same follow-up protocol as the study group. WLC correctly identified 115 tumors, and BLC, 157 tumors. The detection rate was 68.8% for WLC, with a 9.4% rate of false-positive results, and 94% for BLC, with a 14.6% rate of false-positive results. The diagnostic accuracy in CIS lesions was 57.3% for WLC and 95% for BLC, while in pTa tumors; it was 68.8% for WLC and 94% for BLC. 62 cases of the study group diagnosed with NIBT emphasized a recurrence rate of 6.4% after 5 months. The control group described a recurrence rate of 24.2%. HAL fluorescence cystoscopy is a valuable diagnostic method for patients with NIBT, with considerably improved accuracy by comparison to WLC, and a significant impact upon the short-term recurrence rate.","1424":"This paper analyses the adequacy of different types of networks in biological process modeling. The assumptions are sustained by two case studies. The first one is a lattice-based computer model to simulate the growth of nonvascular tumors with nutrient consumption constraints. The modeling solution is able to reproduce the classic three-layer structure familiar from multicellular spheroids: cell proliferation, quiescent and necrosis. The accuracy of this model is tested by comparing it to a fractal morphometric technique of two patterns, one of them obtained by simulation, the other developed in vitro. The second application is the growth of a directed network, in which the growth is constrained by the cost of adding links to the existing nodes. This is a new preferential attachment scheme, different from those specific for the construction of scale-free graphs, because its new nodes prefer to attach to existing nodes with lower degree. We relate this mechanism to a simple food-web model studied by simulations.","1425":"Two main ways to fix the reduction were imposed in surgical treatment of the acromioclavicular joint dislocations: fixation with trans acromioclavicular pin (Phemister method) and fixation with plate and screws type acroplate. The purpose of the present paper work is to compare immediate and later postoperative results between the two types of surgical interventions. During 2005-2007, 37 surgical reductions and fixation of acromioclavicular joint dislocations were performed in the Orthopedic-Traumatology Clinic of SUUB. In 17 cases a fixation with screws and plates type acroplate has been performed and in 20 cases with pins using the Phemister method. Sex ratio: 31 men and 8 women. Patients were aged between 17 and 56 years old. Follow up at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 18 post-operatory months. Osteosintesis material removing was done postoperatively, at 4 weeks in case of acroplate's and at 6 weeks in case of the pins. All patients treated of fixation with plate and screws acroplate type had a favorable evolution\/development, starting with the shoulder joint mobilization at 24 hours postoperatively, with a complete recovery 4 weeks after the operation, at the same time with the ablation, and without immediate other late complications. As far as the patients treated by using the Phemister method are concerned, they were applied an immobilization, postoperatively. Desault bandage or the scarf for a period between 1 and 3 weeks, beginning with the shoulder joint mobilization later on and a full recovery after a minimum of 6 weeks. However, 3 of the cases showed a migration of one or both pins. Following the study, a more rapid recovery resulted, complete, and without complications of mobility in the shoulder joint, when using plate type acroplate vs pin.","1426":"The goal of this general article is to present a survey of the current knowledge about the clinical approach of restoring endodontically treated teeth. The best way to restore teeth after root canal treatment has long been and still is a controversial subject of debate to this day. The clinical approach of restoring endodontically treated teeth needs taking into consideration several issues: aims of coronal restoration, criteria for establishing the various modalities of coronal restoration, clinical solutions of restoring teeth after endodontic treatment, guidelines regarding restorative materials and techniques, possibilities and limits of restoration using direct adhesive materials and techniques. The aims of coronal restoration of endodontically treated teeth are generally considered to be the following ones: to prevent recontamination of the root canal system and\/or periapical space, to replace missing hard dental tissues and to restore coronal morphology and functions, to provide the necessary strength for the restoration\/tooth complex in order to withstand functional stress and prevent crown and\/or root fracture. The criteria for establishing the modalities of coronal restoration for endodontically treated teeth are: amount and quality of remaining hard dental tissues, topography and coronal morphology of the tooth, functional occlusal forces that the restoration\/tooth complex has to withstand, restoring requirements in order to include the treated tooth in a comprehensive oral rehabilitation treatment plan, esthetic requirements.","1427":"Vulnerability in schizophrenia is an integrative concept, which tries to explain the development of schizophrenia as an interaction between different individual susceptibility factors and environmental risk factors. Vulnerability markers used in genetic studies include biochemical indicators, neuroanatomical, neurophysiologic, and cognitive abnormalities. Among those, the most extensive studied markers were: evoked potentials, smooth pursuit eye movements, and attentional deficits. Some of the potential indicators presented in this paper satisfy most of the criteria necessary for a vulnerability marker, but none meets all of them. Nevertheless, they represent important markers of risk to schizophrenia.","1428":"A causal link between the increasing environmental pollution and the fast spreading of allergic diseases is currently discussed. The exogenic and endogenic noxious agents contributing to the total environmental load are primarily acting through immunotoxic, sensitizing and neurotoxic mechanisms in animal experiments and in humans. Beside classic allergic-triggering factors (allergen potency, intermittent exposure to different allergen concentrations, presence of microbial bodies and sensitizing phenols), the adjuvant role of environmental pollutants gains increasing importance in allergy induction. Our therapy experience with more than 18.000 atopic eczema patients shows that beside allergic reactions pseudoallergic mechanisms through toxic environmental agents (formaldehyde, industrial and traffic smog, wood preservatives, microbial toxins, additive-rich food, nicotine, alcohol, pesticides, solvents, amalgam-heavy metals) are increasingly incriminated as causal factors for the complex symptomatology. The avoidance and elimination of such triggering factors before and during pregnancy and in early childhood may result in a significant decrease of the incidence of atopic diseases.","1429":"The aim of this article is to analyze cardiac dysfunctions occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). Cardiac dysfunctions are common complications following SCI. Cardiovascular disturbances are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both acute and chronic stages of SCI. We reviewed epidemiology of cardiac disturbances after SCI, and neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic. SCI causes disruption of descendent pathways from central control centers to spinal sympathetic neurons, originating into intermediolateral nuclei of T1-L2 spinal cord segments. Loss of supraspinal control over sympathetic nervous system results in reduced overall sympathetic activity below the level of injury and unopposed parasympathetic outflow through intact vagal nerve. SCI associates significant cardiac dysfunction. Impairment of autonomic nervous control system, mostly in patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI, causes cardiac dysrrhythmias, especially bradycardia and, rarely, cardiac arrest, or tachyarrhytmias and hypotension. Specific complication dependent on the period of time after trauma like spinal shock and autonomic dysreflexia are also reviewed. Spinal shock occurs during the acute phase following SCI and is a transitory suspension of function and reflexes below the level of the injury. Neurogenic shock, part of spinal shock, consists of severe bradycardia and hypotension. Autonomic dysreflexia appears during the chronic phase, after spinal shock resolution, and it is a life-threatening syndrome of massive imbalanced reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in patients with SCI above the splanchnic sympathetic outflow (T5-T6). Besides all this, additional cardiac complications, such as cardiac deconditioning and coronary heart disease may also occur. Proper prophylaxis, including nonpharmacologic and pharmacological strategies and cardiac rehabilitation diminish occurrence of the cardiac dysfunction following SCI. Each type of cardiac disturbance requires specific treatment.","1430":"Saliva, the most available and non-invasive biofluid of the human body, permanently \"bathes\" the oral cavity and is trying to cope with an ever-changing milieu. The oral cavity, a very complex and unique milieu due to its dual function, is the only place in the body where the mineralized tissue is exposed to the external environment in which there are complex interactions between various surfaces: host soft and hard tissues, food, air, and microorganisms. Saliva includes a large number of inorganic and organic compounds, which act as a \"mirror of the body's health.\" In addition to its other functions, saliva could constitute the first line of defense against oxidative stress. Due to its composition and functions, saliva could have a significant role in controlling and\/or modulating oxidative damages in the oral cavity. As a diagnostic fluid, saliva offers distinctive advantages over serum. Furthermore, saliva may provide a cost-effective approach for the screening of large populations. Gland-specific saliva can be used for diagnosis of pathology specific to one of the major salivary glands. Whole saliva, however, is most frequently used for diagnosis of systemic diseases. As we enter the era of genomic medicine, sialochemistry will play an increasingly important role in the early detection, the monitoring and progression of the systemic and oral diseases. We reviewed the current data within literature and of our research concerning clinical potential of the saliva.","1431":"Decoding the mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics is essential in fighting a phenomenon, which is amplifying everyday due to the uncontrolled excessive and many times unjustified use of anti-microbial substances. At present it has become a matter of public health, together with the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to tuberculostatic or the spreading of the AIDS virus which not only affects the European countries but the entire globe. This paper presents the genic mutations taking place at the level of bacterial chromosome and inducing the resistance to antibiotics.","1432":"","1433":"We assessed the efficacy of surgical treatment for the patients with eso-respiratory fistulas. The following cases revealed the anesthesic and surgical difficulties, and also intraoperative and postoperative complications that can occur when the esophageal contents get into the respiratory system. In these situations, therapy must be adapted according to fistula's topography and etiology, and also to patients' biological conditions.","1434":"Alstrom syndrome is an extremely rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by a group of signs and symptoms including infantile onset dilated cardiomyopathy, blindness, hearing impairment\/loss, obesity, diabetes, hepatic and renal dysfunction. Since the first description of the syndrome in 1959, there have never been reported cases of Alstrom syndrome with the occurrence of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome in their relatives, this case suggesting a close genetic link between these two ciliopathies. The presence of empty sella seems to be a rare morphologic finding in Alstrom syndrome although it has been documented in few Bardet-Biedl cases. We report a case of a 20 -year-old caucasian male with hearing and visual loss, short stature, insulin resistant diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy, hepatic and renal dysfunction, hypertension, and alopecia. By studying his family medical records we identified two relatives with suggestive clinical findings for Bardet Biedl syndrome. Analyzing the clinical traits of these patients we found that retinopathy, nephropathy and central obesity were present in all patients, suggesting a main anomaly in ciliary function controlling photoreception, renal and metabolic processes. The occurrence of similar clinical cases within a family further demonstrates the existence of a common pathologic cilliary mechanism, a genetic basis of phenotypic variability in seemingly monogenic disease and a functional link between rare disorders and common traits with overlapping clinical manifestations. Genetic studies in such patients may provide new data regarding the consequences of defective cilia and a possible identification of new gene mutations. ","1435":"Clinical nonfunctional pituitary microadenomas, also known as incidentalomas are accidental observations made due to the application of high resolution imaging techniques as computed tomography or magnetic resonance. There are no standards regarding the follow-up of these tumors and taking into account their increased frequency among general population (during the last years they were based on the high performances of the imaging methods), we decided to study their dimensions and their evolution over time. We have also analysed their behavior with respect to their endocrine phenotype and the minimum period of time needed for the repetition of the imagistic procedure. To observe the natural evolution of tumors' dimensions in a group of patients, diagnosed with nonfunctional pituitary microadenomas based upon hormonal measurements and computed tomography scan. There is a retrospective observational study on 149 patients hospitalized in our Clinic between 1994 and 2006. Initially, all the pituitary hormones and the computed tomography were performed. Only nonfunctional microadenomas were included (the maximum diameter 11 mm). 69 patients were examined for a long period of time--29.75 +\/- 24.79 months by CT scan and secretory profile, repeated at different periods of time. At the end of 29.75 months, the aspect of microadenoma was still present, without any statistically significant changes of the diameter. One of the cases became macroadenoma and another proved to be a microprolactinoma. Only 5 cases of all 149 presented a double lesion. No case of pituitary apoplexy was registered. These observations lead to the conclusion that it is not necessary to repeat the computed tomography scan sooner than 2 years once the diagnosis ofincidentaloma was established. ","1436":"Angina pectoris is a common disabling disorder and a clinical syndrome, caused by myocardial ischemia; an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen consumption. Thus, ischemia produces a typical series of events such as metabolic and biochemical alterations which lead to impaired ventricular relaxation and diastolic dysfunction, impaired systolic function, and electrocardiographic abnormalities and painful symptoms of angina. Transmembrane ionic currents are responsible for the cardiac potentials that are recorded as the electrocardiogram (ECG). The electrocardiographic profile of patients with angina pectoris is variate. The electrocardiogram provides critical information for both diagnosis and prognosis, particularly when a tracing is obtained during the episodes of pain. A completely normal electrocardiogram does not exclude the possibility of acute coronary syndrome. Serial ECG tracings improve the clinician's ability to diagnose acute and chronic coronary syndromes. The ECG may assist in clarifying the differential diagnosis if taken in the presence of pain. The resting ECG also has an important role in risk stratification. Exercise ECG is more sensitive and specific than the resting ECG as far as myocardial ischemia detection is concerned, and it represents the test of choice which helps identifying inducible ischemia in the majority of patients suspected of stable angina.","1437":"In the genesis of dental-maxillary anomalies both morphologic factors (of proven genetic origin) and functional factors (as added ethio-pathogenic elements) are incriminated. From this point of view, Class II\/2 malocclusion, presents two morphologic factors whose genetic origin is certain and upon which functional factors have minor influence. These are: the morphology of the teeth and alveolar process in the anterior region of the maxilla and the type of rotation. The combination of the two generates a broad range of deep bite case variants.","1438":"The necessity for complex and multidisciplinary approach of \"border\" surgical pathology has unanimously been agreed upon for such a long period of time, its advantages becoming even more obvious in rare, particular cases. We report the case of a 39 year-old man diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis back in his childhood. He is admitted with a giant pseudotumoral scrotal mass presenting an important scrotal enlargement (40\/35 cm). Physical examination, blood tests, ultrasound, IVP, abdominal and chest CT, psychiatric and plastic surgery evaluation established the diagnosis: peno-scrotal lymphedema with gigantic hydrocele and depressive disorder. Taking into account the important enlargement of the scrotum associated with the alteration of the local skin, we decided to form a mixed surgical team: urology--plastic and reconstructive surgery. We performed bilateral surgical therapy of hydrocele with partial excision and eversion of sac edges, excision of penoscrotal skin and subcutaneous tissue surplus. At the end we made a reconstruction by using a partial-thickness graft from the normal skin of the left thigh. Spinal anaesthesia was sufficient in order to perform a qualitative complex surgery. Intra and postoperative course was uneventful with minimal blood loss. Rare cases like this one clearly reveal the advantages of a multidisciplinary surgical team by combining usual surgical procedures from different specialities that could lead to spectacular results. ","1439":"The surface of the eye is an anatomical and functional entity with a relatively recent delimitation but with significant therapeutic and diagnostic consequences. The pathology of the conjunctive and cornea must be approached by looking at the interrelations between the two tissues that are so different anatomically and functionally but in the same time form a unit in structuring the eye's surface. There are two major categories of relations between the two tissues: one of them is mediated by lachrymal secretion, a process whose complexity is not yet fully understood, and the other is germinal, referring to the stem cells located at the limbus which become epithelial cornea cells that can fixate lachrymal fluid. Imbalances in the quantity and quality of lachrymal secretion can be compensated, up to a certain point, by artificial products, but in severe cases only specially prepared autologous serum can compensate the deficit. The limbic deficits that affect stem cells require complex therapeutic procedures like limbic cell transplant, using an amniotic membrane or autologous serum.","1440":"The aim of this general article is to present an overview of the current knowledge about composition and structural changes and also about specific biomechanical alterations related to vitality loss or endodontic therapy. For a long time, these issues have been controversially approached from a clinical standpoint and are therefore still confusing for many practitioners. Vitality loss or endodontic procedures seem to induce only negligible changes in hard dental tissue moisture. Physico-chemical properties of dentin can be modified by some of the endodontic chemical products used for chemo-mechanical debridement. On the other hand, tooth biomechanical behavior is affected, since tooth strength is reduced proportionally to coronal tissue loss, due to either pre-existent carious\/non-carious lesions or cavity acces preparation, besides restorative procedures. The related literature shows the lack of accepted clinical standards and consensus regarding the optimal way of approaching the specific tooth biomechanics following endodontic therapy.","1441":"Homocysteine is a sulfurated amino acid used for the synthesis of methionine. The last decade's researches proved that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. The vascular injury induced by several mechanisms of hyperhomocysteinemia is the hallmark of homocysteine's atherogenic properties. Hyperhomocysteinemia is present in 85% of the patients with chronic renal failure (cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of mortality) and persists after initiating dialysis or after renal transplantation. Although folic therapy or folinic acid therapy reduce homocysteine levels with 20-40% in hemodialysis patients, the effects on cardiovascular morbidity have yet to be proven in future studies.","1442":"The aim of this paper is to determine the possibilities of modern radiofrequency (RF) technology and the usefulness of abdominal and thoracic parenchymatous organs in surgery. Investigation was made on 17 patients with 125 RF energy realized cycles (an average of 7.35 per one pt.) and the average time heating coagulative necrosis of 42.6 minutes (maximum to 80 minutes). There was one complication (pleural effusion) in a patient with RF treatment of 5 metastases colorectal carcinoma (MCRC) and synchronous right hemicolectomy. There were no other complications either to close or to distant to the organs. The urgent need of RF technology was in the case of a patient with iatrogenic rupture of spleen, treated by radiofrequency coagulation (RFC) with documented preservation of the whole organ. Most of the patients with MCRC (64%) were intraoperatively treated with a combination of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and radiofrequency assisted resection (RFAR) of the liver with success in 95% of the cases. In the surgery of echinococcal liver cyst located deep, in the parenchyma, RFA were used for scolicidal purpose, and for hepatotomy. In the treatment of lung malignancies RF technology was reserved for nonsurgical candidates suffering from NSCLC, but also for surgical patients as a palliative measure in the treatment of local symptoms related to non-resectable primary and secondary tumors, presenting an aggressive tumor growth on the thoracic wall and the great vessels, with the possibility of reducing the number of explorative thoracotomy.","1443":"Immunological abnormalities in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) imply several antibodies, among which anti-cyclic cytrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) have the highest sensitivity and specificity. Their diagnostic and prognostic value in RA is well known, although their value as markers of the disease activity has not been established yet. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between anti-CCP antibodies and RA activity which eventually leads to the best treatment of choice. 217 consecutive patients hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology, \"Sf Maria\" Clinical Hospital between 01.01-31.06 2007 were retrospectively studied. They were divided into two groups: group A-111 patients with RA (ACR criteria fulfilled) and group B-106 patients with other rheumatic diseases. The following parameters taken out of the patients files were studied: parameters of the clinical activity of disease (C reactive protein, fibrinogen), rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. Disease activity score (DAS) using 4 variables (number of tender joints, number of swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and assessement of the disease activity) was also studied. Data were processed with SPSS program using linear functions, Pearson correlation coefficient and Hi2 test of interdependency. The sensitivity of anti-CCP antibodies in patients with RA was 56.75%. The specificity of anti-CCP antibodies in patients with RA was 90.56%. Low seric levels of anti-CCP antibodies were also found in patients without RA, but with other conditions like: osteoarthritis, viral polyarthritis, infectious myositis and Still disease; moderate to high seric levels were found in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Significant correlations were found between anti-CCP antibodies and DAS (r = 0.437), between anti-CCP and fibrinogen (r = 0.32) between anti-CCP antibodies and C reactive protein (r = 0.237) as well as between anti-CCP and RF (r = 0.38). Anti-CCP antibodies are highly specific but moderately sensitive for RA, their highest frequencies and seric levels being found in seropositive RA. Anti-CCP can be used in patients with RA not only as a diagnostic marker but also as a reliable test for assessing the activity of the disease. ","1444":"Neuronavigation and stereotaxy are techniques designed to help neurosurgeons precisely localize different intracerebral pathological processes by using a set of preoperative images (CT, MRI, fMRI, PET, SPECT etc.). The development of computer assisted surgery was possible only after a significant technological progress, especially in the area of informatics and imagistics. The main indications of neuronavigation are represented by the targeting of small and deep intracerebral lesions and choosing the best way to treat them, in order to preserve the neurological function. Stereotaxis also allows lesioning or stimulation of basal ganglia for the treatment of movement disorders. These techniques can bring an important amount of confort both to the patient and to the neurosurgeon. Neuronavigation was introduced in Romania around 2003, in four neurosurgical centers. We present our five-years experience in neuronavigation and describe the main principles and surgical techniques.","1445":"Renovascular hypertension in children is a very rare illness. It occurs as a result of the imbalance between hypotensive and hypertensive systems. Renal ischaemia (95% of the cases) and the shortening of hipotensive factors (5% of the cases) are responsible for the production mechanism of renovascular hypertension in children. In order to make an early diagnosis regarding the renovascular hypertension in all children suffering from renovascular illnesses, blood pressure must be taken correctly and repeatedly. This paper is a case study on 19 children with renovascular hypertension, aged between 2 and 15 years old. Most cases were divided into two groups: subjects aged 4-7 years old and subjects aged 8-12 years old. Each group represents 34.2% of all cases. The diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in those 19 children was established after correctly taking the blood pressure and comparing it with the normal values for each age. Hypertension was diagnosed before knowing its cause in 8 neglected cases. The blood pressure was repeatedly taken in the other 11 children suffering from renovascular illnesses and the diagnosis of hypertension was early established when blood pressure values increased. Previously, blood pressure was normal in these 11 cases. The etiopathogenical diagnosis showed parenchymal diseases in 12 cases--63.1%. Seven patients suffered from renovascular lesions--36.9%. Laboratory exams, radiology, imagistic exams, arteriography and scintigraphy were steps taken in order to establish the etiopathogenical diagnosis. These exams showed the next direct causes of renovascular hypertension: bilateral chronic pyelonephritis in 4 cases--21.4%, hydronephrosis in 3 cases--16.2%, congenital renal hypoplasia in 2 cases--10.4% and doubled kidney in 2 cases--10.4%. The other 8 cases presented acute glomerulonephritis, unilateral renal agenesis, horseshoe kidney, unilateral pyelonephritis, renal artery agenesis, renal trauma, renal abcess and Wilms tumor, one case of each illness--5.2%. The major complications were: retinopathy, chronic renal failure and stroke. Laboratory data are just a hint in diagnosing renovascular hypertension. However, radiology, imagistic exams, arteriography and scintigraphy are compulsory in the renourinary status and etiopathogenical diagnosis. ","1446":"Craniosynostosis represents a defection of the skull caused by early fusion of one or more cranial sutures. The shape alteration of the cranial vault varies, depending on the fused sutures, so that compensatory growth occurs in dimensions not restricted by sutures. Craniosynostosis can be divided into two main groups: syndromic and nonsyndromic. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is typically an isolated finding that is classified according to the suture(s) involved. Syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with various dysmorphisms involving the face, skeleton, nervous system and is usually accompanied by developmental delay. In the last 15 years, research on craniosynostosis has progressed from the description of gross abnormalities to the understanding of the genetic basis of certain cranial deformities. Mutations in the genes encoding fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3), TWIST and MSX2 (muscle segment homebox 2) have been identified in certain syndromic craniosynostosis. The molecular basis of many types of syndromic craniosynostosis is known and diagnostic testing strategies will often lead to a specific diagnosis. Although the clarification of a genetic lesion does not have a direct impact on the management of the patient in many cases, there is a significant benefit in providing accurate prenatal diagnosis. This review summarizes the available knowledge on cranisynostosis and presents a graduated strategy for the genetic diagnosis of these craniofacial defects.","1447":"The Romanian health care system is facing a period of deep transformations, having in the last years some clear achievements, but also some acknowledged problems. Once the world's economic crisis appeared and manifested its first effects in Romanian economy, there will be some consequences in the health sector too. Regarding the Romanian social health insurance scheme, it's possible to assist to greater financial constraints in 2009 due to reduced contributions and a weaker economy. There are two possible solutions to face this challenge: diminishing the basic health services covered by the social health insurance system (difficult to be accepted by politicians and population) and better use of available resources based on an improvement of allowance and technical efficiency. The authors have made a critical analysis of the Romanian health care system facing the forecasted effects of the economic crisis and have proposed some interventions and solutions to reduce the effects at the level of the patient. In order to increase allowance efficiency clear measures are necessary to be taken at central and local level: improvement of financing mechanisms, alignment of the incentives used by the payment mechanisms for different type of providers, development of guides and protocols based on available resources, etc. For increased technical efficiency there is a need for adequate incentives within the financing and organization mechanisms in order to make the public providers more active in obtaining greater outputs from the available resources. The economic constraints will lead to the growth of the quality of medical services. This is the reason why the health system needs the development of the accreditation systems for providers. The audit of medical activities and reporting represents a mechanism which needs to be developed. Regarding the new health technologies' use new institutions and mechanisms need to be implemented. They will allow making certain decisions on health technologies' use based on cost-effectiveness criteria. The efficient use of the available resources cannot be done without the proper incentives system for professionals who provide health care services. It means that we should establish a better relationship between the professional individual performance and the official revenues. It's clear that the actual economic crisis will induce effects in the health care sector. It is up to the Government and the physicians, professional bodies and patient's associations to reach a consensus regarding the introduction and the development of some appropriate rules and mechanisms, which will have less effects of the crisis at the patient's level. ","1448":"The present paper brings to the medical specialists' attention a possibility of multivalent imagistic investigation--the palmar electrographic method submitted to a totally new analysis by the fractal method. Its support for information recording is the radiosensitive film. This makes it resemble the radiological investigation, which opened the way of correlating the shape of certain structures of the organism with their function. By the specific electromagnetic impressing of the ultra photosensitive film, palmar electrography has the advantage of catching the shape of certain radiative phenomena, generated by certain structures in their functional dynamics--at the level of the human palmar tegument. This makes it resemble the EEG, EKG and EMG investigations. The purpose of this presentation is to highlight a new modality of studying the states of the human organism in its permanent adaptation to the living environment, using a new anthropological, informational vision--by fractal processing and by the couple of concepts system \/ interface--much closer to reality than the present systemic thinking. The human palm, which has a special medial-anthropological relevance, is analysed as a complex adaptive biological and socio-cultural interface between the internal and external environment. The fractal phenomena recorded on the image are ubicuitary in nature and especially in the living world and their shapes may he described mathematically and used for decoding their informational laws. They may have very useful implications in the medical act. The paper presents a few introductory elements to the fractal theory, and, in the final part, the pursued objectives are concretely shown by grouping the EG images according to certain more important medical-anthropological themes.","1449":"Potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser photoselective vaporization prostatectomy (PVP) is a relatively new technology for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We reviewed our initial experience regarding the efficacy and safety of this technique for symptomatic and obstructive BPH. During the last year, 35 patients with a mean age of 65.3 years (between 53 and 80) and symptomatic BPH were treated by laser prostatectomy using KTP\/532 laser energy at 120W. The procedure was performed through a 21F continuous-flow cystoscope with normal saline as irrigant. All patients underwent standard urologic evaluation using the International Prostate Symptom Score (LPSS), the urinary peak flow rate (Q(max)), ultrasound measurement of prostate volume and residual urine volume, assay of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE). The mean prostatic volume was 45 cm3 (range 30-70 cm3). The patients were reassessed postoperatively at 3 and 6 months. In all cases, KTP laser vaporization was successfully performed, with a mean operating time of 57 minutes (range 20-120 minutes). In most cases, we used just one fibre, the mean energy released being 170.000 Joules (range 80.000-270.000). The mean hospital stay was 24 hours. No major complications occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively, and no transfusions were necessary. All patients were catheter-free after 1 month. At 3 and 6 months, the mean urinary peak flow increased from the preoperative value of 8.5 mL\/sec to 23.7 mL\/sec and 21.2 mL\/sec, respectively. The mean IPSS decreased from 19.0 to 9.5 and 7.5 at 3 and 6 months, and the mean post-voiding residual volume (PVR) decreased from 90.5 to 30.5 mL and 15.0 mL. Two patients were admitted for secondary hematuria and urinary infection, and 7 patients presented irritative low urinary tract symptoms during their first postoperative check-up. BPH photoselective vaporization using 120W Green Light laser is a safe and easy to learn technique, with good functional results and a low rate of complications.

Management of patients in irreversible apallic syndrome has been the subject of sustained scientific and moral-legal debate over the last decade. Neuroethics coming more and more into consideration when neurological societies address key issues relating to AS\/VS prevalence and quality management. With regard to treatment limiting and withdrawal of nutrition and hydration of patients suffering from irreversible full state Apallic Syndrome and Minimal Conscious State. The overall incidence of new AS\/VS full stage cases all aetiology is 0.5 - 2\/ 100.000 population per year. About one third is traumatic and two thirds are non-traumatic cases. The worst prognosis might be expected from nontraumatic hypoxemic apallic syndrome. The main conceptual criticism is based on assessment and diagnosis of all different AS\/VS stages based solely on behavioural findings without knowing the exact or uniform pathogenesis or neuropathologic findings. No special diagnostics, no specific medical management can be recommended for class II or III AS treatment and rehabilitation. But in United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland active euthanasia is now practiced in medicine taking into account the uncertainty of the right diagnose the clinical features for humanistic treatment of patients in irreversible \"AS full or early, remission stages\". As long as there is no single AS\/VS specific diagnostic tool, no specific laboratory investigation regimen to be recommended neuroethical principles demands by all means a humanistic (ethical) activating nursing even in the irreversible full stage AS cases. Full acceptable is only the palliative pain therapy with renunciation of maximal therapy. Active euthanasia is a criminal act and has to be respected as such in neuroscience. ","1451":"An 18 years old male was referred to us 4 years after major tumoral surgery. In 2002 he was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma of the proximal two-thirds of his left femur. Wide resection of the tumor was performed, with a makeshift implant one-stage reconstruction, followed by a combination of chemo and radiotherapy for another 6 months. Eight months after surgery a deep infection of the hip developed, and despite antibiotic treatment and two consecutive debridments and lavage the results were negative. When we first saw the patient in 2006, he still had an active infection in his left hip and a septic general appearance. A two-stage revision was performed and a modular tumoral reconstruction was implanted. At two years follow up the patient presents no signs of recurrence neither of the infection nor of the primary tumor.","1452":"Vulvodynia is a complex disorder and described as discomfort or intense burning pain in the vulvar area. Such chronic pain affects 5 to 15% of women and many suffer of misdiagnosis. For sure the aetiology is multifactorial. Through few studies we consider the inflammatory response plays a major role. There is a genetic profile of women suffering of vulvodynia, especially genetic polymorphisms from genes coding for cytokines, Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and Interleukin-1 beta, and gene coding for mannose-binding lectin (MBL). These polymorphisms result in a stronger inflammatory response and lay these women in a susceptibility situation. Histological analysis showed a chronic no specific inflammation. We have also demonstrated that these patients present in normal state or under infectious induction an inadequate inflammatory response. But there is still a variety of mechanisms which can interact with the inflammatory response. Management of such vulvar pain syndrome could be very frustrating, but the first step for improvement is to get the right diagnosis.","1453":"This article reviews some of the recent data concerning Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry in a general hospital. As the organic medical conditions have a major impact on the one's quality of life and self-awareness as an ill-person, very often a psychiatric disorder appears as co-morbidity. It is the responsibility of the psychiatrist to recognize and to treat these psychiatric conditions, and also to develop good work-relationships with the patients and the clinical team.","1454":"Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have not been previously characterized among Romanian patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We initiate this study to detect the mutations in APC gene in blood and tumor samples collected from 16 patients (10 men and 6 women) and blood samples from 21 first and second degree relatives of the patients. For this the presence of mutations in exons 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 as well as in regions B, L and W of exon 15 was investigated using PCR multiplex. In the same time, we have searched for 5 bp deletions at codon 1061 of APC gene by PAGE and SSCP methods. These methods allowed us to evidence identification of the presence of mutations in samples from 7 individuals. In one patient, was detected a deletion of exon 13th of APC gene both in DNA extracted from blood and tumor samples. Multiple deletions (e.g. in exon 6, 12, and in 15L and 15W regions) in DNA extracted from the tumor sample were detected, but not in DNA probe obtained from blood cells. We can speculate that these mutations are an example of genomic instability accompanying the malignancy. Till now, no mutation affecting 1061 codon of APC gene was identified in the patients investigated in our study.","1455":"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) represents a common endocrinopathy, with anovulation and hyperandrogenism as cardinal symptoms. In recent years it has been recognized that insulin resistance is an intrinsec feature of the disorder and plays a central role in pathogenesis. PCOS is associated with important reproductive morbidity as shown by high prevalence of anovulatory infertility, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The association of insulin resistance with this reproductive pathology has been well documented. Due to major implication of insulin resistance in PCOS pathogenesis, insulin reduction strategies were studied as a possible treatment for infertility in PCOS patients. Weight loss, even modest was proved to be a simple and efficient method to improve reproductive parameters in PCOS patients and should be recommended to all overweight and obese patients with infertility. Metformin was showed to induce ovulation, at least in a subset of patients with PCOS, but there are not unequivocal proves concerning its efficacy for pregnancies and live-birth rate, mainly because few trials studied this aspect. Therefore there are not enough evidences to recommend metformin for infertility treatment in PCOS. Few small studies with newer thiazolidindiones suggest their efficacy for ovulation induction, but further extensive studies are needed to confirm these results. In conclusion, reduction of insulin resistance was proved to ameliorate ovulation rate in PCOS patients, but strong evidences to sustain the utility of insulin-sensitizing drugs as a therapeutic option for infertility are lacking. Future studies are needed to elucidate these aspects and to characterize the particular subtype of patients with higher probability to respond to this treatment.","1456":"Cranial traumas have different particularities in infants, toddlers, preschool child, school child and teenagers. The assessment of these cases must be individualized according to age. It is completely different in children that in adults. Trauma scales, very useful in grading the severity and predicting outcome in traumatic brain injury, used in adults must be adapted in children. Children have age-related specificity and anatomic particularities, for each of this period of development. Neurotrauma scales, specific for infants and children, such as Pediatric Coma Scale, Children's Coma Score, Trauma Infant Neurological Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, Liege Scale are reviewed, as well as neurotrauma outcome scales, like Glasgow Outcome Scale, modified Rankin score, KOSCHI score and Barthel Index. The authors present these scales in an exhaustive manner for thoroughgoing pediatric neurotrauma standards.","1457":"In the present context of the public health directions, considering WHO main objective, that \"all people of the world could reach the highest possible health level\", in medicine, the accent is put on prevention. In spite of the important progresses achieved in orthodontics field, the treatment still remains a symptomatic one. In this context, we must ask ourselves what are the prevention theoretical and practical coordinates in orthodontics, which measures are available or could be elaborated for preventing the malocclusions development. From the clinical point of view, the most important element of the new perspective is that most of the cases of anomalies which in the present are cured by orthodontics are induced by functional and environmental factors and they can theoretically be prevented. Thus, the identification, control and guidance of the environmental factors which adjust the growing of the maxillaries and of the other cranio-facial structures would be the main target of a prevention program in orthodontics.","1458":"Maternal hypertiroidism is a relative rare disorder, which can seriously complicate pregnancy in each of its periods. There are several maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period. Correct management includes an accurate diagnosis, rigorous individualized treatment and minutious follow-up. We are presenting a retrospective study of 38 pregnant women who delivered in the Obstetric Unit of the University Emergency Bucharest Hospital in the past five years. We established a follow-up protocol in collaboration with endocrinologists. Precocious diagnosis of pregnancy is, in our opinion, mandatory. Accurate diagnosis of hormonal status beginning from the first week of pregnancy is of great importance. Maternal (weight, BP, TSH, thyroid hormones, ECG, etc.) and fetal (ultrasound, non-stress test, Doppler study) evaluation during pregnancy were rigorous performed. abortion rate was 5%; 15% of pregnant women delivered prematurely; cesarean section rate was 22%; fetal outcome was excellent. Treatment adjustment during pregnancy was frequent, 28% of pregnant women had no hormonal treatment in the last trimester of pregnancy. Maternal complications were rare (poor weight gain, tachycardia). Fetal complications included low birth weight (24%), fetal respiratory distress (10%). team work with experienced endocrinologists and understanding of versatility of disease leads to good prognosis of mother and fetus in presence of hypertiroidism. ","1459":"First transcatheter embolization of hepatic artery has been materializing in 1974, in France, for unresectable hepatic tumours. Then, this treatment has become use enough in many countries, especially in Japan, where primary hepatic tumours are very frequent. In this article, we present procedures of interventional endovascular treatment for primary hepatic tumours: chemoembolization, intra-arterial chemotherapy. The study comprises patients with primary hepatic tumours investigated by hepatic-ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. DSA-hepatic angiography is very important to verify the accessory hepatic supply. It has been performed selective catheterization of right\/left hepatic branches followed by cytostatics injection. Most of the patients have benefit by hepatic chemoembolization (cytostatics, Lipiodol and embolic materials). The selective intra-arterial chemotherapy (cytostatics without Lipiodol) was performing in cases with contraindications for Lipiodol or embolic materials injection (cirrhosis-Child C, thrombosis of portal vein, hepatic insufficiency). For treatment of primary hepatic tumours we use 5-F-Uracil, Farmarubicin and Mytomicin C. Less numbers of the reservoirs were placed because financial causes. Chemoembolization was better than procedures without Lipiodol or embolic materials. Lipiodol reached in tumoural tissue and the distribution of Lipiodol harmonises with degree of vascularisation. After the chemoembolization procedure, the diameter of tumours decreased gradually depending on the size of tumour. Effective alternative for unresectable primary hepatic tumours (big size, hepatic dysfunction, and other surgical risk factors) is endovascular interventional treatment.","1460":"alpha-Tocopherol belongs to the group of vitamin E vitamers. Recent years findings indicate that alpha-tocopherol is more than just a simple fat-soluble anti-oxidant as it was found that it can also regulate gene expression. From all vitamin E vitamers human body preferentially retains alpha-tocopherol, but the reasons for this preference are still elusive. Different studies indicated that human body, through the action of two hepatic proteins, alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) and cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2), is able to make subtle structural differences between different vitamin E forms. This is an example of stereochemistry used as a discrimination factor between molecules with different biological activities.","1461":"Natural cannabinoids have been used for centuries for their psychotropic properties, but their possible therapeutic implications in analgesia have been recently documented. The present review intended to make an analysis of the neuroanatomy and physiology of the cannabinoid system (receptors, functions, agents acting on these receptors) and of its implications in neuropathic pain. There were also described the complex phenomena implicated in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain, by high lightening the implications of endogenous cannabinoids in this complex of painful conditions. The pharmacological analgesia test proves of cannabinoid implication in neuropathic pain was sustained by many studies presented in this paper. Therapeutic approaches using natural and synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists were reviewed. Therapeutic perspectives in neuropathic pain might involve the development of new agents that influence the cannabinoid system. Thus, peripheral acting cannabinoid 1 receptors agonists, selective cannabinoid 2 receptor agonists and also modulators of endocannabinoids metabolism might be a way to success in the treatment of this complex entity called neuropathic pain.","1462":"","1463":"Nowadays, Hexvix blue light cystoscopy (BLC) represents an increasingly acknowledged diagnostic method for patients with bladder cancer. The aim of our study was to establish the place of this procedure in superficial bladder tumors diagnosis and to compare it with standard white light cystoscopy (WLC). Between December 2007 and January 2008, WLC and BLC were performed in 20 cases. Transurethral bladder resection (TURB) was performed for all apparent detected lesions. The patients diagnosed with superficial bladder tumors have been followed-up after 3 months by WLC and BLC. The control group included the same number of consecutive patients with superficial bladder tumors, diagnosed only by WLC, which underwent the same treatment and follow-up protocol as the study group. WLC identified 30 suspicious lesions (28 pathologically confirmed), while BLC identified 41 apparent tumors (39 pathologically confirmed). So, from the total number of 40 tumors with positive histology, WLC correctly diagnosed 70% of them, with a rate of 6.7% false-positive results, while BLC diagnosed 97.5%, however presenting a 4.9% rate of false-positive results. 17 cases of the study group diagnosed with superficial bladder tumors were followed. The tumor recurrence rate after 3 months was 5.9% for the study group and 23.5% for the control group. Hexvix fluorescence cystoscopy is a valuable diagnostic method, with considerably better results by comparison to WLC. The improved diagnostic may have a significant impact upon the recurrence rate. ","1464":"Morphea, also known as localized scleroderma is a chronic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by fibrous deposition and obliteration of vessels in the skin. This disease has a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild hyperpigmented plaques to severe, invalidating generalized and pansclerotic forms. Disabling pansclerotic morphea of childhood is a rare and debilitating variant of localized scleroderma, characterized by a rapid progression of deep cutaneous fibrosis that involves the dermis and the subcutaneous adipose tissue but also fascia, muscles, and bone. Contractures and musculoskeletal atrophy develop and the disease has an invalidating and even fatal course. We present an unusual case of severe morphea in a 19-year-old girl, with a polymorphous clinical picture consisting of plaques, linear and pansclerotic, circumferential lesions, with symmetric, invalidating involvement of all limbs and explosive evolution with centripetal progression. This case emphasizes the unpredictable character of morphea evolution, the possible severe prognosis and the therapeutic challenges raised by the generalized, disabling forms of this disease.","1465":"Sudden hearing loss is a sensorineural hypoacusis, unilateral in most of the cases, with an incidence peak in young adult. This article is the result of a four years retrospective study, in which we have tried to see how age, severity of hearing loss, presence or absence of vertigo, the timing of treatment initiation can influence the hearing recovery. 47 patients were included in this inpatient study. They were investigated (clinical, lab and imaging studies) and the treatment protocol included vasodilators, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, plasma expander. In conclusion, a good prognosis in the hearing recovery was associated with absence of vertigo, early treatment (the first 7 days), and hearing loss less than 50dB. Age had no influence on the recovery process.","1466":"Retroperitoneal tumors, whether primary or resulting from the metastasis of other tumors, are a real challenge for the surgeon, in terms of their diagnosis and treatment. They are relatively rare, under 0.2% of the total number of tumors. The clinical examination of retroperitoneal tumors is uncharacteristic and misleading, consisting mainly in palpation of the tumor proper and in assessment of pain. The other signs and symptoms often result from the affected neighboring organs. The imaging investigations used in diagnosing retroperitoneal tumors are ecography, intravenous pyelography, computed tomography, MRI, PET\/CT. The main treatment is surgical, consisting either in total or partial excision of the tumor, or in biopsy samples to make a histopathologic diagnosis. Post-operative course depends mainly on the thoroughness of the surgical treatment, that is the complete excision of the tumor, which increases the chances of survival, while lowering the risk of relapse.","1467":"Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an important predictor of mid and long-term prognosis. Pathological cardiac remodeling is associated with the development of LV systolic dysfunction and of congestive heart failure. The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in preventing cardiac remodeling and LV function improvement is well-known. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist administration instead of ACE inhibitor, in the standardized therapy of STEMI, on LV remodeling and function. We have studied 34 consecutive patients with STEMI (91% men, mean age 58.5 +\/- 10.2 years, 41% with anterior location of MI, mean GISSI class 4.7 +\/- 1.2) within 6 hours of symptom onset, who received standard fibrinolytic therapy with 1.5 million IU of streptokinase, followed by unfractionated heparin for at least 48 hours. These patients also received: aspirin (100%), valsartan (100%), statins (94%), beta-blockers (85%) and other drugs according to the physician's choice. Neither of them received ACE inhibitors. An echocardiography was performed at baseline and 6 months after STEMI. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular mass corrected to body surface (LVm_BS) were used to assess the remodeling process. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a wall motion index (WMI) based on the analysis of regional contractility of 17 segments were taken into account for the LV systolic function. Changes in these values from baseline to the end of the study were compared using the Wilcoxon statistical test for paired samples. After six months follow-up, there were no significant statistical differences from baseline in LVEDD (from 52.1 +\/-6.1 to 52.7 +\/- 5.6 mm, Z = 0.61, p = 0.53) and in LVm_BS (from 104.8 +\/- 27.5 to 105.2 +\/- 27.8 g\/m2, Z = -0.54, p = 0.54). There was a significant improvement of WMI (from 1.57 +\/- 0.29 to 1.43 +\/- 0.34, Z = -3.05. p = 0.002) and a significant increase of LVEF (from 41.0 +\/- 7.1 to 45.2 +\/- 10.0%, Z = 2.96, p = 0.003). The results of this study suggested that administration of valsartan instead of ACE inhibitor, in consecutive patients with medium-risk STEMI, attenuates pathological LV remodeling and improves LV systolic function. However, as obtained within the first six months after the infarction, these results can not be generalized to the later period after STEMI. ","1468":"The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Mild Head Injury (MHI) in children not only in terms of impairment, but also in terms of disability, handicap and quality of life (QOL). Emergency Clinical Hospital \"Bagdasar-Arseni\", Bucharest, Romania, between 2000 and 2004 We take into account the patients with mild head injury MHI (CCS of 14 and 15 and amnesia). From a cohort of 1,319 children, consecutive patients with MHI, presented at the emergency room in a period of four years (2000-2003), 528 children (40.0%) were selected for admission, based on the presence of the risk factors. All admitted patients were investigated based on a protocol of neurosurgical evaluation and were followed for a period of 12 months. The Falls were the most common cause of MHI (30.6% - 162 cases). The proportion of children with detectable CT scan abnormalities was smaller (19.8% - 105 cases) and surgery was necessary in only 5.5% (29 cases). Special attention was paid to child-abuse and traffic accident cases. Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) was observed in 26.9% cases. Neuropsychological tests were performed in 96 children (21.2%), to evaluate neuropsychological, emotional, psychosocial and behavioral impairments. The study has shown that cognitive dysfunctions mainly were observed after MHI (especially deficits in information processing speed, memory and attention). The neurosurgeon should perform a complete evaluation of the children-patient with MHI, including a current physical examination, a neuro-radiological evaluation and a formal neuropsychological assessment, in order to detect the abnormalities and to treat them. Psychotherapy can be of benefit in cases with MHI. Any common case of MHI may hide a possible lesion with delayed consequences. ","1469":"This paper is a retrospective study on 8 patients admitted and treated in Paediatric Surgery and Orthopaedics Clinic of \"M. S. Curie\" Hospital Bucharest between 1997 and 2007. The patients with malignant bone tumors (table 1.) were studied by sex, tumor type, location, age at the moment of diagnosis, age at the moment of the last evaluation, type of surgery, external fixator implanted, complications, results and survival period. We also considered for each patient the extent of the tumor to diaphysis, soft tissue involvement, involvement of physis and epiphyseal invasion, articular extent, vessels and nerves invasion, presence of metastases and local skin invasion. The certain diagnosis was based on pathological anatomy exam, because clinical and imagistic data were not decisive in each case. There were studied only those patients who received external fixators, the only method to achieve oncological safe resection and osteoarticular recontruction. We used monoplanar or circular fixators, in adjustable or mixed mountings. The postoperative complications were not fatal. The survival period has been between 6 months and 18 years. Only two patients, who have survived 6 months and respectively 18 months, were not able to return to prior activities. The other six were reinserted in social activities. Nowadays, there is made a great effort to save the affected limbs. The conservative treatment is preferred to the amputation, which is being used in very few cases. The development of reconstructive bone surgery is sustained by the possibility to delineate the tumor by diagnosis based on imaging and by the possibility to use modern preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Limb conservation was possible only in aggressive benign tumors up to 1970. Since then the same treatment was preferred also in malignant bone tumors, because the relapse appeared as frequent as in cases with amputation but the physical and psychological comfort made the patients to accept it readily. The goal of malignant bone tumors treatment is to save the life of the patient, to preserve the affected limb, to maintain the length and function of the limb. Oncologic surgery consists of \"en bloc\" tumor resection followed by bone reconstruction or modular prosthetic replacement. Modular prosthetic replacement leads to the loss of at least one growing cartilage. The use of radiotherapy in some cases may also affect other growing cartilages, leading to limb length discrepancies.","1470":"The objective of the study was to analyze several immunohistochemical, histological, and morphometrical aspects of angiogenesis in early rheumatoid arthritis synovium. We aimed to identify possible correlations between the histological and immunohistochemical patterns and the serum levels of VEGF, as well as with clinical and biological markers of disease activity. 35 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis below 12 months from the onset, naive for DMARDs, underwent clinical standard examination as well as serum determinations for CRP, RF. anti-CCP2 antibodies and VEGF. DAS28 value has been determined for each patient in order to assess the disease activity. We performed biopsy sampling through arthroscopy, the synovium fragments beeing histopathologically processed, in order to elaborate a total histological score. Immunohistochemical analysis has been performed with quantification of synovial VEGF, VEGF-R1 and CD34 expression. Standard and activated microvascular density (sMVD and aMVD) have been evaluated through double immunostaining (CD34\/ VEGF-R1). VEGF and VEGF-R1 have been identified with high prevalence in endothelial cells, in lining and sublining synovial cells, as well as in inflammatory cells. The study focuses on the analysis of aMVD, a valuable parameter, representative for active angiogenesis, which proved to correlate significantly with the serum levels of VEGF, the composite histological score as well as with VEGF-R1 and DAS28. The statistic analysis of the data support VEGF-R1 and aMVD as markers with predictive value regarding activity and progression in early stages of rheumatoid arthritis. The validation of preliminary conclusions oblige to continuous research through extending the study group and inclusion of several others biomarkers involved in synovial angiogenesis.

The term is borrowed from naval teminology and means gaining the initial control of a damaged ship. Because of the lethal triad the polytrauma patient is at a grave risk. The classical concept of surgically solving all the patient's injuries in the first moment was even theoretically incorrect as a multiple injured patient is a critical patient with depleted reserves. As such, complex procedures were doomed from this point of view. The concept of damage-control surgery emerged in 1992. The core idea was that as minimal as possible had to be done in these critical patients in the first phase, meaning temporary control of a hemorrhage and simple measures for stopping contamination. After 24-48 hours in the ICU, in which time the physiological disturbances were corrected, a further intervention is perfomed for definitively treating the injuries. Further refinements consider five stages and not three in damage-control surgery. The bright side of the concept is an up to 70% survivability rate but with a higher risk of complications, mostly due to the policy of temporary closing the abdomen and sepsis.","1476":"","1477":"The paper discusses how information based medicine has become an increasingly important model of healthcare.

We report the case of a 55 year old female with a medical history of severe hypoglycemic attacks for two months. Blood tests showed a decreased value of glycemia (30 mg\/dl) associated with increased insulin level (l6 microU\/ml) and an increased glycemia\/insulinemia ratio of 1.87 supporting the diagnosis of insulinoma. Abdominal CT showed a 1.5 cm mass localized in the head of the pancreas with disseminated hepatic tumors, confirmed as neuroendocrine metastases by biopsy (which proved the presence of a malignant insulinoma). Primary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed based on mild elevation of calcium (10.4 mg\/dl) associated with a high level of PTH (71.2 pg\/ml). The coexistence of the two endocrinopathies suggested the presence of type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 1). Because of multiple hepatic masses and liver function impairment, surgery and hepatic artery embolization were not performed. Somatostatin analog therapy was started with symptomatic control in the beginning, but rapid loss of beneficial effect. Finally, systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin was administered, but the disease was progressive and after three months we decided to stop it.

The conclusions are based on the following: A huge amount of work involved in carrying out microsurgical reconstructions of over 7500 peripheral nerves in over 3000 patients, 1800 of which were nerve transplants for defects of peripheral nerves of the extremities, for posttraumatic brachial plexus paralyses (91), for replantations and\/or revascularizations following partial or complete amputations of the extremities (24 out of which 23 successful) or for free transfers of functional composite tissues (53). For a more accurate picture of such an effort one should consider the operation time that these types of reconstruction involve: between 3 and 12 hours for each patient under general anaesthesia and for both the anaesthetist and the microsurgeon. Experimental microsurgery on rabbit ears The results of the histopathological examination of 500 postoperative neuromas of peripheral nerves repaired traditionally. The Moberg test. Pre, intra and postoperative monthly observations of the patients until their full recovery according to the criteria set by the International Reconstructive Microsurgery Society (postoperative intervals of 6-12-24 months). Taking pictures and recording pre, intra and postoperative stages. The patients' professional, social and familial reintegration. The patients' state of mind; level of cooperation. Comparing results with those of classic and palliative repairs. Comparing the data resulting from this experience with the information provided by the specialist literature of the world. Completing the internationally defined reconstructive procedures with the personal ones, to produce a new concept.","1485":"In a country with a high prevalence (16%) of chronic serum HBsAg carriers like Romania there is a special interest in the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinics, pathology and treatment of HBV infection The idea of HBV genotyping arose from the need of understanding the complex interactions between virus and host. The purpose of this article is to present a study which aimed to identify the circulating HBV genotypes in Romania. correlate them with the clinical outcome and by HBV genotyping, to make a selection of patients for the most appropriate antiviral therapy. 130 patients were selected from different areas of the spectrum of HBV infection in which a quantitative determination of HBV-DNA was performed. HBV A genotype is associated with the inactive carrier status: a symptomatic HBV-HDV was identified in the double infection. The HBV D genotype has the most common HBV genotype (66%) and is associated with active viral infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Long term HBV chronic infection revealed a mixture of A and D genotypes in most cases. For a proper selection of patient for the antiviral therapy, we should mandatorily genotype the HBV virus before the onset of treatment and all genotyping data must be correlated with liver biopsy assessments.","1486":"The paper proposes a model that brings to light the characteristics of several complex systems having similar scale-free network architecture. The properties of this kind of network are compared with those of other methods which are specific for studying complex systems: nonlinear dynamics and statistical methods. We place particular emphasis on scale-free network theory and its importance in enhancing the framework for the quantitative study of complex biological systems. The advantages and limits in understanding the structure of cellular signaling networks of this model are finally discussed.","1487":"The current paper propose the analysis and extension formulation required for establishing decision in the management of the medical national system from the point of view of quality and efficiency such as: conceiving models for the indices of thermal comfort, defining the predicted mean vote (on the thermal sensation scale) \"PMV\", defining the metabolism \"M\", heat transfer between the human body and the environment, defining the predicted percent of dissatisfied people \"PPD\", defining all indices of thermal comfort.","1488":"Thalassaemia major is a classical example of a disease that can be prevented by prenatal diagnosis. In Romania there are currently 300 patients with thalassaemia major under the management of specialized institutions. Prenatal diagnoses of thalassemia have offered a new dimension to the prevention of this disease, but in order to implement prenatal diagnosis, knowledge of mutations and of their incidence is essential. Molecular testing using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) scanning and direct mutation detection with Amplificaton Refractory Mutation System-PCR (ARMS-PCR) and Restriction endonuclease Analysis of PCR fragments (PCR-RFLP) was performed by using amplified DNA from amniotic cells samples, while mutations in the parents were determined in advance. Using our experience in molecular diagnosis, we were able to perform the first prenatal diagnosis for two young couples at risk for thalassaemia major. Foetal samplings were collected by amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling in the second trimester of the pregnancies. Maternal contamination of the foetal DNA was ruled out by STR genotyping. The prenatal diagnosis revealed affected foetuses with homozygous status of beta-thalassemia major. The IVSI-110 (G-A)\/IVS II-745 (C-G) genotype in the first case foetus and ed 8 (-AA)\/cd 8 (-AA) in the second case foetus were reported. The results of this study point to a successful future prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassnemia in Romania, using a rapid and accurate molecular method. Together with the implementation of proper preventive health measures and the education of parents regarding their carrier status, we are hoping that this method will be used as the common application approach to decrease the incidence of thalassacmia major.","1489":"This article aims to present the experience of our clinic regarding 4 cases of primitive bronchial disease for which a main bronchial sleeve resection with pulmonary conservation were performed between 2005 and 2006. The reduced number of cases allows us express the opinion that in well evaluated cases where bronchoscopic exam is essential the main bronchial sleeve resection and full lung preservation is a procedure that can be made with excellent results for the patient. Life quality is superior to that of cases with pneumonectomy which can be a disease by itself. An adequate technique, the respect for tissues, radical oncologic approach, absorbable monofilament suture material, as well as the protection of the anastomosis with viable tissue from vicinity (pleura, pericardial fat, intercostal muscles) are followed by the best results.","1490":"The sphincter of Oddi disorder (SOD) has been a controversial subject for many years, about which a lot has been written. However, new findings mainly using Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) demonstrate the fact of this diagnostic. SOD is just a part of a larger pathology, the tfunctional gastrointestinal disorders, which have been reconsidered as an important part of gastrointestinal diseases. For a better understanding, the American Gastroenterology Association Institute created a new classification of The Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in 2006, Rome III Classification, in which the SOD is grouped in the functional biliary disorders (category E). The term SOD is used to define manometric abnormalities in patients who have signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin. Based on the pathogenic mechanism and manometry findings, the SOD is separated into two groups: a group characterized by a stenotic pattern (anatomical abnormality) and a second group with a dyskinetic pattern functional abnormality). The purpose of this article is to construct a short presentation of the main aspects regarding tfunctional SOD (E2 and E3 after Rome III Classificatio).","1491":null,"1492":"Intracranial hypertension (ICH) was systematized in four categories according to its aetiology and pathogenic mechanisms: parenchymatous ICH with an intrinsic cerebral cause; vascular ICH, which has its actiology in disorders of cerebral blood circulation: ICH caused by disorders of cerebro-spinal fluid dynamics and idiopathic ICH. The increase of intracranial pressure is the first to happen and then intracranial hypertension develops from this initial effect becoming symptomatic: it then acquires its individuality, surpassing the initial disease. The intracranial hypertension syndrome corresponds to the stage at which the increased intracranial pressure can be compensated and the acute form of intracranial hypertension is equivalent to a decompensated ICH syndrome. The decompensation of intracranial hypertension is a condition of instability and appears when the normal intrinsic ratio of intracranial pressure time fluctuation is changed. The essential conditions for decompensation of intracranial hypertension are: the speed of intracranial pressure increase over normal values, the highest value of abnormal intracranial pressure and the duration of high ICP values. Medical objectives are preventing ICP from exceeding 20 mm Hg and maintaining a normal cerebral blood flow. The emergency therapy is the same for the acute form but each of the four forms of ICH has a specific therapy, according to the pathogenic mechanism and if possible to aetiology.","1493":"The following article, submitted in two complementary parts deals with an important and also modern concept developed under the name of damage-control surgery. Physiopathologically, the multiple injured patient is characterised by the probable, not just possible, appearance of the \"blood's vicious cycle\" of hypocoagulability, hypothermia and acidosis with death as a result. The first part of the article addresses the changes that are the reasons and the basis for applying damage-control surgery. Hypothermia is a direct result of trauma and patient's exposure to it but can also emerge throughout transportation, evaluation, emergency and surgical procedures to which the patient undergoes. Surgical procedures are directly a source that decreases the core temperature. While blood losses accompany trauma for certain and affect clot formation, the patient's coagulation system is impaired by these losses and the dysfunction is further enhanced by hypotermia, different mechanisms being involved. The third lethal component is acidosis. While being at first metabolically produced because of tissular injury, it is further enhanced by the other two elements. From a practical point of view, hypothermia and hypocoagulability can be though, more theoretically addressed, acidosis is more difficult to correct. As fav as the emergency specialist is concerned for the moment, the best solution to deal with this deadly triad is to prevent it. Damage-control surgery is just one type of measure in the process of prevention.","1494":"","1495":"We present the case of an 80-year-old man who was admitted for anemia, back pain and progressive weakness. After a workup of clinical and laboratory data, the final diagnosis was multiple myeloma. The bone marrow aspirate revealed 53% myeloma cells with peculiar and rare morphological features: numerous large asurophilic--bright red granules--mucopolizaccharides and immunoglobulins secreted and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, typically known as Russel bodies.","1496":"Once that Romania became part of the European Union, conditions regarding the activity in dentistry changed, and open borders are now a fact that we have to accept. The Romanian activity in dentistry developed a lot after the 1990. being a result of private dental practice--which covers over 98% and also of material resources of patients that were asking for more performing dental treatments. In order to be able to face all this, the dentists followed many of postgraduate specializations. We have to consider as well that the situation of the Romanian dentists is not the best, because they had to face the dentists that got their certificates in Eastern countries, where they only had to pay a fee and not pass an exam. Also, the Romanians that wanted to specialize abroad were not able to do that because the National Dentists' Association was protecting their own colleagues.","1497":"Urinary peritonitis (the uroperitoneum) is categorized as a difficult to diagnose clinical entity due to its poor manifestations. Vesical trauma following pelvis bone fracture is the most frequently involved in the uroperitoneum aetiology, followed by spontaneous vesical rupture and intraoperative iatrogenic lesions. One of the most important and constant signs that can occur is diffuse abdominal tension, without tenderness. The imagistic procedure that sets the diagnosis is retrograde cystography showing intraperitoneal urine effusion. Vesical rupture is a surgical emergency. The uroperitoneum is a particular type of peritonitis that has hidden and misleading symptoms which can delay the diagnosis long enough to endanger the patient's life.","1498":"Since the first description of uterine artery embolisation for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids of the uterus in 1994, this minimally invasive procedure has been increasingly performed in many countries. Transcatheter embolisation of the uterine arteries feeding large fibroids is a minimally invasive technique. This paper presents the combined endovascular and surgical therapy in the treatment of uterine fibroma. The purpose of this therapy is saving the reproductive function of the uterus even in cases with very large fibromas or located in areas with difficult access, in which hysterectomy would have been needed. The therapy has a high rate of success, it is accompanied by disappearance of the symptoms and it has a low risk of intra- and postoperatory complications. The first step is the embolisation of uterine arteries--a safe therapy of uterine fibroma. The procedure eliminates the risk of post-miomectomy relapse through the symultaneous devascularisation of all fibroma nodules, even of the very small ones which are unapparent clinically or imagistically. The post-embolisation surgical intervention is undertaken in conditions of operative comfort, with minimal bleeding; it eliminates the need for blood transfusions and diminishes the duration of intervention. Three representative cases where this therapy has been successfully applied are presented in this article. The embolisation of the uterine arteries represents an efficient therapy of the uterine fibroma, with very good results noted in the speciality literature.","1499":"The exceptional progress in obstetrics, especially in the second half of the 20th century, creates a series of dilemmas, without having yet the answer to old, basic questions, such as premature delivery and prevention of preeclampsia. Sexual liberty and the delay of the first pregnancy are responsible for the drop in natality rate and the increasing demand for assisted reproductive technologies. Their success is marked, though, by a drastic increase in the multiple birth rate and its complications. The advancing maternal age brings along a number of cardiovascular pathologies that endanger not only the present pregnancy, but also the long distance health prognosis. Plus, there is a marked risk for foetal chromosomal anomalies, which explains the need and the importance of prenatal diagnosis. Probably the newest branch in materno-foetal medicine, it offers many answers and solutions, but there are still a lot of question marks. In conclusion, the progress is necessary, is expected, but it should always be filtered by time and experience.","1500":"Hepatitis C viral infection is accompanied by various serum alterations that could explain its molecular impact on hepatic structure and metabolic homeostasis. Recently it has been shown that adipocytokines play a pivotal role in development of hepatic steato-fibrosis, different studies giving a support of the hypothesis that the balance of adipocytokine expression is a key regulator for the progression of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. The association between insulin resistance and hepatitis C virus genotypes and liver fibrosis stage foreshadowed that virus-induced insulin resistance may be a mechanism for fibrogenesis in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The main importance of adipocytokine profile detection consists in the prediction of steatosis induction that has clinical relevance, being associated with advanced fibrosis and hyporesponsiveness to antiviral therapy.","1501":"The classic symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are secondary amenorrhoea, abdominal pain and vaginal haemorrhage, with a clinical picture of varying acuteness. It is among the commonest causes of maternal mortality during the first three months of pregnancy. In the majority of cases (95%) the pregnancy is tubal, but other sites are possible (cervical, corneal, ovarian, peritoneal). In the treatment of sterility or medically assisted reproduction, the risk of ectopic pregnancy should be borne in mind. The individual risk factors may be cumulative, particularly with a previous history of extrauterine pregnancy or tubal surgery (including sterilisations). pelvic post-inflammatory status (adhesions proved by coelioscopy) or presence of an intrauterine device. Diagnosis is based on serum beta-hCG concentration and transvaginal ultrasound. Laparoscopy is the treatment of choice for tubal pregnancies. The decision to perform salpingotomy depends on the presence\/status of a contra lateral tube. In carefully selected cases local or intra-muscular administration of methotrexate allows conservative treatment, provided the patient does not present acute bleeding. It is also indicated where trophoblastic tissue persists after surgery, notably salpingostomy. and in non-tubal ectopic pregnancies. The latter are rare, however, and it is important to recognise them in view of the more serious complications.","1502":"The paper presents the definition of rules for the medical algorithms in some infectious diseases and also the mathematical functions for modeling: interrogation rules to elaborate specific concepts and work methods in HIV\/AIDS infection, interrogation rules to elaborate specifically concepts and work methods in SEPSIS, initial conditions regarding the introduction of the notion of stochastic correlation coefficient, determination of the the stochastic correlation coefficient through the method of reciprocal comparison of the variables, determination of the influential ponders through reciprocal comparison of the characteristics. models for the study of the variation of the specific medical criteria of some infectious diseases in the case of adopting the analysis method of reciprocal non comparison.","1503":"Bilateral Wilmns' tumors with an unfavorable histology requires a combined treatment (extensive surgery, polychimiotherapy, radiotherapy). Presentation of the first renal transplant performed in Romania in a child with bilateral Wilms' tumor, at 3 years and 4 months after the end of a multimnodal treatment. Patient C. N., born on 30.04.1998, was diagnosed in 04.2001 with right parenchymal renal tumor, polycystic kidney, left cystic renal tumor. 25.04.2001--right radical nephrectomy and partial left upper pole nephrectomy; histopathology examination: triphasic bilateral nephroblastoma, reactive lymph nodes, negative resection edges in the left kidney. 30.04-19.11.2001--polychemotherapy according to the NWTS-5 stages 2-4 focal anaplasia and radiotherapy of the right kidney bed (29.06.2001). 02.2002--a nephrotic syndrome on the remnant kidney which requires its excision and peritoneal dialysis. Abdominal control CT was normal in 03.2005. 11.03.2005- renal transplant from living related donor. Favorable post-transplant course with normal renal clearance values; at 2 months, normal urography control. The tumor pathology does not represent an absolute contraindication for renal transplantation. For the cases with extensive surgery, polychimiotherapy and radiotherapy correctly applied, a pre-transplant \"tumor-free\" period of at least 2 years is compulsory. ","1504":"In the field of neurosurgery, like in other surgical specialties, the last decades have brought major achievements. The series of revolutionary discoveries has started during the last century in the fifties, with stereotactic radiosurgery, then continued with the implementation of operative microscope (during the seventies), the endovascular embolisation in the nineties and finally with the major improvement in robotic neurosurgery and molecular neurosurgery at the beginning of this century. The major innovation has been brought not only in the field of therapeutical measures but also in the field of neuro-imaging. Thus, the modern MRI with more than 3 Tesla, can reveal to the neurosurgeon the most intimate structures of the nervous system. Several important areas in neurosurgery like: vascular neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery and brain tumors pathology, benefit from the modern technology and from the latest discoveries from genetic and molecular biology. In conclusion, summarizing the discoveries of the last decade, we emphasize that the related areas like genetics, molecular biology, computer technology become more and more important in the future progress of the neurosurgery.","1505":"Life is changing dramatically, market position as part of life is becoming more and more important, and marketing, considered a key cultural architect of nowadays that involves voluntary relation exchanges between the communicating partners, is placing the patient in the center of most adequate action towards the medical future which represents his life quality. We think that the moment has come to resort to marketing as a new method to identify innovation opportunities in healthcare services' delivery, considering that the high quality of healthcare services, answering to demands of healthcare systems' consumers, represents a well recognized priority for the European citizens. Consequently, the model of \"healthcare business\" has to rely on the value for patient by creating competition concerning the results at medical condition level.","1506":"","1507":"The present paper is aimed to analyze the need for an adequate engagement in a better understanding of the relation between \"Life and Medicine\", within the increasing importance of the patient's point of view, while quality of life is managed within medicine and even going beyond. It is necessary to reconsider the essential role of communication in an adequate offering of the right answers in accordance with the changes in medical care, quality of life being one benefit. Science should inform the news agenda on the way of building a collaborative environment, turning up the conversation focused on patients' lives, while practicing medicine with an open heart for the physician-patient-family relationship and based on models of quality of life outcomes. That is why it is important to create new knowledge and competencies starting from intangible resources such as an engagement as a consequence of a communication programme which produces an increased level of perception of the outcomes of the necessary mature actions as meeting and surpassing patient expectations, not forgetting the vulnerability to the way in which choices are described. From here is resulting the imperative of the development of better abilities in innovation, differentiation, branding and patient-driven health care service, largely opening the window of opportunity for the educational mission to educate marketers who make a difference by taking the lead from a strategic planning position."},"articletitle":{"0":"Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on a general surgery clinic.","1":"A retrospective analysis of surgical techniques and outcomes of hydatid disease in Wasit, Iraq.","2":"Clinical efficiency of allergen-specific immunotherapy with fungal allergens in patients with chronic polypous rhinosinusitis against the background of fungal sensitization.","3":"The need for socket preservation: a systematic review.","4":"The effect of Crocin on sperm parameters disorders induced by peripheral administration of nitrosamines in male rats.","5":"Predictors of regular physical activity behavior and quality of life in post-menopausal Iranian women based on the multi-theory model.","6":"SARS-COV-2 -
