Neuropsychological impairments, sex differences and the concurrent abuse of cocaine and alcohol have been suggested as facilitation mechanisms. To review and recapitulate the results obtained on the relationship between neuropsychological deficits due to cocaine abuse and\/or prenatal exposure and the expression of violence. Furthermore, we analyze the roles of sex, concurrent alcohol abuse and possible brain damage as risk markers in this relationship. The scientific literature was reviewed using Google Scholar, PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline and ISI Web of Knowledge. Cocaine facilitates the expression of violence due to neuropsychological deficits in emotional decoding, abstract reasoning and inhibitory control, as well as in mnemonic and verbal skills, and such impairments might also explain problems in decision-making. Both the deficits and the expression of violence appear to be more pronounced in men than in women. However, despite the fact that the combination of cocaine and alcohol use may increase the risk of violent reactions, the deficits would not be greater than those resulting from the separate use of each substance. The impairments might be caused by functional abnormalities of certain regions of the frontal (especially the prefrontal) and parietal lobes and some subcortical structures, such as the amygdala. All of this would provide a basis for the development of intervention strategies focusing on these cognitive domains. ","298":null,"299":"Smoking is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. One of the priorities of public health programmes is the reduction of its prevalence, which would involve millions of people quitting smoking, but cessation programs often have modest results, especially within certain population groups. The aim of this study was to analyze the variables determining the success of a multicomponent therapy programme for smoking cessation. We conducted the study in the Smoking Addiction Unit at the Hospital of Manresa, with 314 patients (91.4% of whom had medium or high-level dependency). We observed that higher educational level, not living with a smoker, following a multimodal programme or smoking cessation with psychological therapy, and pharmacological treatment are relevant factors for quitting smoking. Abstinence rates are not associated with other factors, such as sex, age, smoking behaviour characteristics or psychiatric history. The combination of pharmacological and psychological treatment increased success rates in multicomponent therapy.

The results indicate that the prevalence of alcohol consumption in the past year was 89.3%, whereas within illicit substances, the prevalences were higher for cannabis (27.8%), followed by cocaine 20.3%). In order to analyze the possible effect of consumption on levels of perpetration and victimization of partner-aggression, the sample was divided into 4 groups: nonconsumers (16.3%), alcohol consumers (58.6%), illicit drug consumers (3.5%), and consumers of alcohol and illicit drugs (21.7%), finding that the groups of nonconsumers and alcohol consumers presented the lowest level of perpetration of psychological, physical, and sexual aggression and of victimization of psychological and physical aggression, whereas the group of consumers of alcohol and illicit drugs presented the highest levels. The results reveal the need to assess substance consumption when designing intervention protocols with batterers.","301":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate, in a sample of young people and adults from the general community, the psychometric properties of two models developed for assessing gambling motives (Gambling Motives Questionnaire and Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Financial; GMQ and GMQ-F). Specifically, a confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to assess the fit of the two models to the data. Internal consistency of the scales was then analyzed. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to analyze the utility of gambling motives for predicting levels of gambling problem severity. The final sample was made up of 341 young people and adults, aged 18 to 60, who reported any gambling activity during the last six months. The maximum likelihood (ML) method with robust Satorra-Bentler correction was used to evaluate the fit of the models to the data. The results indicated that both the GMQ and the GMQ-F models show a reasonable fit to the data. All scales have adequate internal consistency values. Enhancement, coping and financial gambling motives were associated with greater severity of gambling problems. Overall, the results indicate that both models have adequate psychometric properties, though the GMQ-F appears to provide a more comprehensive alternative for assessing gambling motives in the general community.","302":"This article examined the relationship between cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption and cannabis use and problem gambling among a random and representative sample of 1447 Spanish adolescents (797 males and 650 females with an average of 12.8 years). An ad-hoc questionnaire was used to assess cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption (beer, wine and spirits) and cannabis use. Gambling was assessed with the South Oaks Gambling Screen Revised for Adolescents (SOGS-RA). Results indicated a positive and significant association between cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption and the two aforementioned variables. A larger percentage of cigarette smokers and drinkers was found among those participants who had consumed cannabis before or scored significantly in problem gambling. Additionally, multiple regression analysis confirmed that both cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption (beer and wine) were the most determinant variables for cannabis use and problem gambling.","303":"","304":"The literature provides support for the hypothesis that some major repeaters (individuals with &gt;=5 lifetime suicide attempts) are addicted to suicidal behavior (SB). This study explores whether major repeaters are addicted to SB or not using 7 criteria: tolerance (Criterion 1), withdrawal (Criterion 2), loss of control (Criterion 3), problems in quitting\/cutting down (Criterion 4), much time spent using (Criterion 5), substantial reduction in activities (Criterion 6), and adverse physiological\/physical consequences (Criterion 7). Total dependence on SB was indicated by the presence of 3 or more of the 7 criteria in the last 12 months. This cross-sectional study at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital (Madrid, Spain) recruited 118 suicide attempters including 8 major repeaters (7%, 8\/118), who were all females. The association between each SB addiction criterion, physiological dependence and total dependence with major repeater status was tested for significance and for effect size with odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. As hypothesized, major repeaters met significantly higher frequency of criteria for total dependence on SB, OR=62.9 (6.4-615). A backward stepwise logistic regression model was used to provide an OR between major repeater status and total dependence status corrected by confounding variables. Age, panic disorder without agoraphobia, borderline personality disorder, history of psychiatric inpatient admission, and total dependence on SB were introduced as independent variables with major repeater status as the dependent variable. The model selected total dependence and age as the remaining significant variables in the last step. Accordingly, major repeaters appear to be addicted to SB. ","305":"","306":"The exact mechanism by which ethanol exerts its effects on the brain is still unknown. However, nowadays it is well known that ethanol interacts with specific neuronal membrane proteins involved in signal transmission, resulting in changes in neural activity. In this review different neurochemical alterations produced by ethanol are described. Primarily, ethanol interacts with two membrane receptors: GABAA and NMDA ion channel receptors. Ethanol enhances the GABA action and antagonizes glutamate action, therefore acting as a CNS depressant. In addition, ethanol affects most other neurochemical and endocrine systems. In regard to the brain reward system, both dopaminergic and opioid system are affected by this drug. Furthermore, the serotonergic, noradrenergic, corticotropin-releasing factor and cannabinoid systems seem to play an important role in the neurobiology of alcoholism. At last but not least, ethanol can also modulate cytoplasmic components, including the second messengers. We also review briefly the different actual and putative pharmacological treatments for alcoholism, based on the alterations produced by this drug.","307":"Binge drinking (BD) is the most common problematic drinking pattern during adolescence and youth. At the same time, it is a period marked by profound structural and functional brain changes, which may be affected by heavy alcohol consumption. In recent years, a considerable number of studies that attempt to characterize the effects of BD on the brain has been published. However, to date there is not any critical review in Spanish language on neurostructural, neurophysiological and cognitive consequences that may result from the maintenance of a BD pattern of alcohol consumption during adolescence and youth. The purpose of this review is to critically summarize the main research results on the effects of BD on the brain. To this end, a literature search in databases Web of Knowledge, PubMed and PsycINFO for the period 2000-2013 was performed. In general, studies agree that BD is associated with 1) lower performance on tasks assessing cognitive processes such as attention, memory and executive functions, 2) structural changes (in white matter and gray matter) in different brain regions and 3) neurophysiological abnormalities (hyper\/hypoactivation) linked to different cognitive processes. These results, although still need to be contrasted, warn about important consequences that could result from the persistence of BD on a young and still maturing brain.

The questionnaire consists of 17 items, developed from the CERI (Internet-Related Experiences Questionnaire - Beranuy and cols.), and assesses the problematic use of non-massive video games. It was validated for adolescents in Compulsory Secondary Education. To validate the questionnaire, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and an internal consistency analysis were carried out. The factor structure shows two factors: (a) Psychological dependence and use for evasion; and (b) Negative consequences of using video games. Two cut-off points were established for people with no problems in their use of video games (NP), with potential problems in their use of video games (PP), and with serious problems in their use of video games (SP). Results show that there is higher prevalence among males and that problematic use decreases with age. The CERV seems to be a good instrument for the screening of adolescents with difficulties deriving from video game use. Further research should relate problematic video game use with difficulties in other life domains, such as the academic field.

There are not many research works on the specific pharmacologic treatment of dual comorbid anxiety disorders. Most authors recommend a simultaneous approach of both, anxiety and substance use, disorders. Research data on pharmacotherapy suggest that psychotropics used in the treatment of anxiety disorders are also effective in dual diagnosis. SSRIs are considered first-line therapy in the treatment of dual anxiety while benzodiacepines should be avoided.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, state anxiety, attention, time estimation and manual dexterity were registered before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) intake of alcohol (38.4 g) or a non-alcoholic beverage. Trait anxiety was registered in phase 2 only. The results showed that acute consumption of a high dose of alcohol: i) improves attention in men (although the performance of alcohol consumers was not better than that of non-consumers); ii) blocks the systolic blood pressure habituation phenomenon (observed in controls) in women; and iii) blocks the improvement in manual dexterity (associated with experience in non-consumers) in both sexes. On the other hand, male consumers had a lower heart rate than non-consumers, independently of the phase, while female consumers had a higher state anxiety and performed worse in attention than controls, also independently of the phase. These results help to understand the extent of performance impairment of different tasks produced by risk alcohol consumption in young men and women. ","316":"Craving and nicotine withdrawal syndrome (NWS) are components of the tobacco use disorder in DSM-5. They both appear after smoking cessation or an abrupt reduction in tobacco use, and they are associated with both short and long-term smoking-cessation outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the association of craving and withdrawal with smoking cessation at the end of the treatment and relapse at 3 months follow-up in a Spanish sample of smokers. The sample comprised 342 smokers (37.7% men; 62.3% women) receiving a cognitive-behavioral treatment for smoking cessation. The assessments of craving and withdrawal were conducted using the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale. Abstainers at the end of the treatment, compared to non abstainers, showed significantly lower post-treatment withdrawal, and post-treatment craving. Furthermore, they had lower scores in pre-treatment nicotine dependence. Among abstainers, craving decreased significantly from pre-cessation levels, while in those participants who did not quit smoking it remained on the same levels. High nicotine dependence was a predictor of smoking at the end of the treatment, whereas high nicotine withdrawal predicted relapse at 3 months. Findings support the robust role of craving and NWS in smoking cessation and relapse, although they differ in their specific patterns of change over time.

The sample consisted of 95 cocaine dependent participants, 53.7% of whom had been diagnosed with Axis II personality disorders. We utilised a descriptive methodology, which allowed us to examine correlations between the different variables, group differences in these variables, and their ability to predict different dimensions associated with the risk of dropout. Results show that the risk of dropout during the first two months of treatment is not associated with the existence of comorbid personality disorders. With regard to the cognitive profiles of personality disorders, we show that the antisocial profile is associated with higher risk of dropout. The profile of patients at higher risk of treatment dropout is characterised by lower levels of perceived quality of life and elevated levels of impulsivity, especially the experience of strong impulses under positive affect. Therefore, the presence of psychological dimensions tightly associated with emotions, affects and subjective feelings are the more relevant to estimate the risk of treatment dropout in cocaine dependent patients. This study stresses the variables that need to be specifically addressed during early phases of cocaine addiction treatment, since they are associated with higher risk of treatment dropout.

The bibliographic coupling methodology is the analytical procedure that determines the thematic-intellectual proximity of the documents under consideration through the identification of the shared or simultaneously cited bibliography by those documents. A factor analysis and network analysis have been carried out to cluster documents, graphically represent the existing core research areas, and analyse the interrelations between them. We have identified 30 core research areas. Alcohol is the topic of attention of 17 areas and cocaine has a strong presence in 6. Heroin and opiates are only present as prominent substances in 4 areas and cannabis and tobacco in other two for each substance. It has been found that there is a significant degree of fragmentation in the area, with the existence of numerous research foci but with few connections with each other and few documents showing shared common knowledge. Also noteworthy is the large number of emerging research areas, reflecting an incipient stage in many of the research topics. Consideration must be placed in promoting scientific consensus and cohesion of the discipline as well as to encouraging the consolidation of main lines that respond to the social problems and research challenges.

More specifically, impulsivity traits - positive and negative urgency, sensation seeking, lack of premeditation, and lack of perseverance - in (1) the occurrence of initial negative consequences linked to use, and (2) the transition from consequences possibly indicating a problematic behavior to consequences very likely indicating a clinical problem. For this, 709 first-year college students were assessed using the UPPS-P impulsive behavior scale, and the Multicage CAD-4 scale for addictive behaviors. Logistic regressions were used to discriminate (a) between individuals with a 0-score and individuals with a 1-score in the Multicage scales (low severity range), and (b) between individuals with a 2-score and individuals with 3\/4-score (high severity range), separately for alcohol and Internet use. For alcohol use, positive urgency and lack of premeditation marked the transition from 0 to 1 scores, whereas negative urgency marked the transition from 2 to 3\/4 scores. For Internet use, however, none of the UPPS-P dimensions significantly marked the transition from 0 to 1 (occurrence of initial negative consequences), and positive urgency marked the transition from 2 to 3\/4 (from possible to very likely problematic behavior). Negative urgency arises as a pathologization marker for alcohol abuse, whereas changes in non-clinical levels are linked to impulsivity elicited by appetitive emotions. Impulsivity does not seem to play any role in low severity levels of Internet use, and positive urgency marks the transition between high severity scores. These differential patterns are indicative of different etiological paths for excessive Internet use and substance abuse.","327":"The relationship between the use of cannabis and the decision-making processes was explored. A computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task (Cards Software) in its normal and reverse version was used, and the Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) model, which characterize the process of decision-making based on the parameters: Recency, Consistency, Loss aversion and Utility shape, was applied. Seventy-three cannabis consumers and a control group with 73 nonconsumers participated in the study. In the normal mode, subjects in the control group scored higher than cannabis consumers. Both groups showed consistent responses and aversion to loss. Nonconsumers showed greater influence of the gain-loss frequency, while consumers were more influenced by the magnitude of the gain-loss. The influence of immediate choices was higher among consumers who showed a quick oblivion while in the control group this process was more gradual. In the reverse mode, task performance was better among control group participants. Both groups showed consistency, loss aversion, more influenced by the magnitude of the gain-loss, and low influence of immediate elections. The results show the relationship between drug use and the decision-making processes, being consistent with the results obtained in other studies where consumers had worse results than control group. Moreover, the PVL parameters allow to adequately characterize decision-making. This confirms the relationship between drug use and decision-making by either the vulnerability prior to consumption or the neurotoxicity of drugs.","328":"Alcohol intensive consumption (AIC) in university students has important clinical and social implications that motivate the need to look into the factors that favor its apparition and consolidation. More concretely, this study assesses the role of impulsivity and the associated expectations about consumption, as well as the possible mediation of expectations in the relationship between impulsivity and AIC. Three hundred and three students in the first year at the University Complutense of Madrid that carry out AIC kept a self-record of their consumption, a scale of expectations associated to the ingestion (IECI, 2012), and the BIS-11 scale of impulsiveness. In all cases, both men and women, doubles the grams of alcohol that define an AIC, as well as the frequency in the execution of this behaviour, which increases the probability that these negative consequences come about. No differences were found between men's and women's expectations associated to AIC, nor in their total impulsivity scores. The hierarchy regression analysis shows that expectations do not moderate the relationship between impulsivity and consumption. Both variables influence the independent mode of consumption (grams of ingested alcohol and frequency of ingestion), with a higher weight on expectations from both, men and women, but being significant the input of impulsivity only among males. This justifies the need to plan interventions that address the modification of these expectations, including, in the case of males, the aspects related to impulsivity.","329":"Stroke is an international health problem with high associated human and economic costs. The mortality rate from stroke in Russia is one of the highest in the world. Risk factors identification is therefore a high priority from the public health perspective. Epidemiological evidence suggests that binge drinking is an important determinant of high stroke mortality rate in Russia. The aim of the present study was to estimate the premature stroke mortality attributable to alcohol abuse in Russia on the basis of aggregate-level data of stroke mortality and alcohol consumption. Age-standardized sex-specific male and female stroke mortality data for the period 1980-2005 and data on overall alcohol consumption were analyzed by means ARIMA time series analysis. The results of the analysis suggest that 26.8% of all male stroke deaths and 18.4% female stroke deaths in Russia could be attributed to alcohol. The estimated alcohol-attributable fraction for men ranged from 16.2% (75+ age group) to 57,5% (30-44 age group) and for women from 21.7% (60-74 age group) and 43.5% (30- 44 age group). The outcomes of this study provide support for the hypothesis that alcohol is an important contributor to the high stroke mortality rate in Russian Federation. Therefore prevention of alcohol-attributable harm should be a major public health priority in Russia. Given the distribution of alcohol-related stroke deaths, interventions should be focused on the young and middle-aged men and women.","330":"The aim of this study was to know the addiction to training and the relationship between this and the intrinsic satisfaction, perceptions and beliefs about the causes of success in their sport in a heterogeneous sample of 401 Spanish master athletes (over 35 years of age) who completed the questionnaire electronically.

On one hand, it was found that addiction to training was moderate in men and women, and being cause from different causes than in other populations of athletes. On the other, that it was predicted by high ego orientation and\/or low task orientation. In addition, each of the less desirable subscales of addiction (tolerance, lack of control and abstinence and craving), although with significant differences by sex, were usually predicted by the also less desirable subscales of intrinsic satisfaction, perception and beliefs on the causes for success. By contrast, the most desirable subscale of addiction (pleasure and relaxation), although predicted by the most desirable and positive subscale of intrinsic satisfaction (fun), there was no gender matching in the prediction by the subscales of perceived beliefs on the causes for success.

A simple document analysis was performed in order to collect data on the production, sale, and consumption of injecting equipment in the Czech Republic in combination with questionnaire screening in the NEPs and 21 brief interviews with key informants. Ten types of IE most commonly used for drug injecting by the Czech drug users were identified. Approximately 5,038,000 pieces of sterile IE were marketed in the Czech Republic in 2010. According to four manufacturers (with a market share of 96%) and with reference to the year 2010, 5,430,694 pieces of sterile IE were provided to Czech injecting drug users (487,694 pieces of IE were sold to IDUs in pharmacies and 5,038,000 pieces of IE were distributed by NEPs in 2010). We compared the amount of IE provided to IDUs as reported to the CMC National registry by NEPs (4,943,000) with that of IE distributed by manufacturers and distributors (5,038,000) in the country in 2010 and found a difference of less than two percent using two different methodologies. This study confirms the accuracy of the data on the amount of IE exchanged as collected by the CMC monitoring system. This study opens up important public health practice and policy-making issues.

The dependent variables were: being a victim of assault, aggression or sexual violence. The independent variables were: binge drinking (six or more drinks on one occasion at least once in the month) and the monthly frequency of alcohol consumption. The adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for men reporting binge drinking (vs. negative reporting) was of 1.85 (95% CI: 1.28 to 2.66) for assault, 2.0 for aggression (1.40 to 2.66), and 1.35 for sexual violence (0.43 to 4.23).

In our study, gender determines the type of discharge, being therapeutic discharge more frequent among women. A higher educational also increases a better prognosis with a higher rate of therapeutic discharge among individuals with higher education level. A later age at the beginning of the treatment reduces the likelihood of therapeutic discharge. Likewise, polidrug abuse, diagnosis of psychotic disorders and borderline personality disorder are associated to a lower rate of therapeutic discharge. Recognizing these characteristics will allow the early identification of those patients more at risk of dropping treatment hastily, while trying to prevent it by increasing the therapeutic intensity. ","352":"Mexico is a country affected by drugs in every aspect: it is a drug producing country of heroin, marihuana and methamphetamines, mainly for external markets but also for the growing internal demand; it is a transit country for cocaine that has found its way through the Central American and Mexican corridor on its way to external markets and for the internal supply. As a result of the increasing availability of substances and a favorable social environment, it has become a consuming country; drug experimentation use and dependence of illegal drugs, although still low, have increased. The abuse\/dependence of legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco are the main substance abuse problems; only the abuse of pharmaceuticals remains low and relatively stable, mainly as a result of low availability for medical purposes and therefore limited scope for deviation. Social costs are considerable, as happens in other countries in the region, violence being the most prevailing characteristic of the drug scene, increasing from 2008 onwards. Within these important challenges for health and security, it is also true that significant, continuous efforts have been made by demand reduction programs at the national level since 1972 and adapted to the changing circumstances. This editorial seeks to tell the story of drug transitions in Mexico and the programs that have been implemented and discusses areas of opportunity for a new approach.","353":"This paper describes patterns of alcohol consumption and associated problems in Brazil. Data came from a multicluster random sample of 2,346 Brazilians 18 years of age and older. The survey was conducted in 2005-2006 and had a response rate of 66.4%. About 35% of the men and 59% of the women did not drink in the past 12 months, while 39% of the men and 13% of the women consumed alcohol at least once a week. Further, 38% of the men and 17% of the women consumed 5 or more drinks \"usually\", and 40% of the men and 18% of the women reported binge drinking in the past 12 months. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders (DSM-4 abuse and\/or dependence) was 19% among men and 4% among women. Although abstinence in Brazil is relatively high, binge drinking is frequent and, thus, alcohol problems and alcohol use disorders are also frequent. ","354":"The high drug use that occurs at raves and the specific characteristics of these parties make them a high risk recreational context the health of participants. The aim of this paper is to establish a categorization of research on drug use and raves according to their objectives and main results. Knowledge and research needs identified as a result of this review are discussed. To this end, a systematic review of scientific literature through Medline, Psycinfo and Psicodoc was conducted. After applying the inclusion criteria, 36 papers were obtained, classified into six categories. The results show that 23 studies aim psychosocial profile analysis, and the prevalence and patterns of drug use. Nine studies focus on risks related to drug use, and nine in the drug effects. Given the high risk associated with raves and the scarcity of empirical studies identified, the need to develop further empirical studies is addressed. There is still insufficient evidence to guide intervention strategies to prevent risks and harms among ravers. There is also a need to explore: polydrug use, harm reduction strategies, positive effects and motivations. ","355":"Despite the availability of data about drinking frequency and patterns, the surveys on alcohol use among adolescents carried out in Europe tend not to provide information about diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders (AUD) or estimation of their prevalence. This study assesses the prevalence of AUD among a sample of Spanish adolescents, to identify the most prevalent symptoms, and explore gender differences in AUD in this population. The final sample consisted of 504 participants aged 15 to 18, obtained by means of random sampling from all the schools in the region of Asturias (Spain). The presence of alcohol abuse (AA) and alcohol dependence (AD) disorders was evaluated according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. The results showed that 12.5% of the sample met the criteria for the diagnosis of AUD (6.7% for alcohol abuse, AA, and 5.8% for alcohol dependence, AD). The most prevalent symptoms were having social problems for AA diagnosis (9% of students who reported alcohol use in the past year) and tolerance for AD diagnosis (45.8% of students who reported alcohol use in the past year). Males showed a significantly higher score than females in AUD, AA and two AA diagnosis criteria (hazardous use and legal problems). The prevalence of AUD among Spanish adolescents is very high, males being more likely than females to endorse criteria for AUD and AA, though not for AD. These findings reveal a serious health issue and highlight the need to develop preventive efforts and provide coordinated alcohol-abuse interventions. ","356":"The socio-cultural environment is an important factor involved with the onset of smoking during adolescence. Initiation of cigarette smoking occurs almost exclusively during this stage. In this context we aimed to analyze the association of school and family factors with adolescent smoking by a cross-sectional study of 16 secondary schools randomly selected from the Balearic Islands involved 3673 students and 530 teachers. The prevalence of regular smoking (at least one cigarette per week) was 4.8% among first year students, 11.6% among second year students, 14.1% among third year students, 20.9% among fourth year students and 22% among teachers. Among first and second year students, there were independent associations between regular smoking and adolescents' perception of being allowed to smoke at home, belonging to a single parent family, poor relationship with parents, poor academic performance, lack of interest in studies and teachers' perception of smoking in the presence of pupils. Among third and fourth year students, there were independent associations between regular smoking and poor relationship with parents, adolescents' perception of being allowed to smoke at home, poor academic performance, lack of control over student misbehavior and the school attended. The school policies and practices affect student related health behavior regarding smoking, independent of individual and family factors.","357":null,"358":null,"359":"In early adolescence, family is one of the main risk\/protection agent for drug misuse. Its influence on health habits acquisition makes family a key target for prevention programs. The aim is to conduct a comparative analysis of European family prevention programs. For this purpose, 85 programs were reviewed. Programs were retrieved from EMCDDA database EDDRA (Exchange on Drug Demand Reduction Actions). No time period was delimited; hence time span was 1998-2011. 53% of all programs came from 4 countries (Ireland, Germany, Portugal and Spain). 89% were unspecific drug prevention or health promotion programs. Providing information about drugs is the main objective pursued by the majority of the programs. Over half the programs (59.7%) report having undergone an outcome evaluation process. Regarding the program objectives, 70.59% do not address any of the risk factors proposed by the main theories in international literature. Despite the solid theoretical framework that supports coherent evidence about family risk factors, prevention programs' objectives and components have a low theoretical compliance rate and the level of evaluation continues to be a challenge. Some aspects of the EDDRA functioning are reviewed.","360":"The present article aimed to analyze the relationships between perception of family support, levels of depression, anxiety and hopelessness in alcohol or drug dependent patients (AOD). Participated of this study 97 patients under treatment, aged between 18 and 58 years, of both genders from six private institutions for treatment of drug dependency, located in Santos-SP\/Brazil. Participants responded to the Inventory of Perceived Family Support-IPSF, the Beck Depression Inventory-BDI, Beck Anxiety Inventory-BAI, Hopelessness Scale-BHS and Criteria for substance abuse or dependence at DSM-IV TR. Results indicated negative correlations between perceived family support and levels of depression, anxiety and hopelessness. Moreover, family support proved to be a conditional variable for levels of anxiety and depression. These results indicated that the perception of family support may be an important social support for the patient with AOD.","361":"Differences in pathological personality traits and disturbances in brain metabolites between non consumers, abstinent and non abstinent consumers were assessed. Participants (n=113) aged between 18-45 years with personality disorder (PD) were diagnosed with clinical interview and scales for depression, anxiety, impulsivity and dimensions of personality pathology. Brain metabolites were analyzed with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and multiple comparisons. Abstinent and non-abstinent differentiated from non-consumers in emotional deregulation, inhibition, and restricted expression; abstinent and non-abstinent differentiated from each other in self-aggression, dissocial behaviour, conduct disorder, stimulus seeking and intimacy problems. N-Acetyl Aspartate and creatine values were lower between non-abstinent in prefrontal, anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellar vermis and superior corona radiata. For abstinent, choline levels were greater in cerebellar vermis and n-acetyl aspartate were lower in dorso-lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulated cortex and insula. Regarding personality traits, insecure attachment, narcissism, lability, self-aggression and anxiety characterize consumers and abstinent, while suspiciousness, rejection and character hardness are found in consumers (non-abstinent and abstinent). Compulsive traits, unplanned body impulsiveness and lack of control in emotional regulation predominated in non-abstinent and participants with co-morbidities. Detachment and inhibition predominate in alcohol abuse disorder and narcissistic traits in substance abuse. ","362":null,"363":"Dual diagnosis (DD) is the co-occurrence, in the same person, of a mental disorder (MD) and a substance use disorder (SUD). Nowadays, the study of the personality with DD is realized mainly from a categorical view, focusing on the detection of personality disorders and not on the traits associated to DD and the possible differential profile compared to those patients with only MD or SUD. Studies analyzing personality traits of patients with DD and their possible differential profile are very limited. However, existing data indicates that DD patients show higher levels of Sensation Seeking, Impulsivity, Harm Avoidance and Neuroticism; and lower levels of Persistence, Self-Direction, Self-Transcendence and Cooperation. Therefore, DD is associated to personality characteristics that suggest more disruptive behaviors, fewer resources for recovering and keeping abstinent and worse prognosis compared to those with only one disorder. Progress in the characterization of personality traits in DD, taking into consideration the methodological aspects to be improved could allow better adaptation of the integrated treatment of these patients in the future. ","364":"The comorbidity between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders is very common. A review of literature addressing prevalence, clinical features and treatment of the comorbidity between ADHD and CNS depressants was conducted. The prevalences found have a wide range (4.5% to 58%). ADHD has been associated with greater severity of addiction, early onset of consumption and addiction, more psychiatric comorbidity and more chronicity. In drug-dependent patients the diagnosis is a complex process because the frequent overlap of symptoms. The screening instruments should be used with caution. Drug therapy has shown efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms, but there is no consensus regarding their influence on substance use. However, results should be interpreted cautiously, because the samples are small. Psychoeducational interventions are relevant, but treatment outcomes have not been described or studied systematically.","365":"The tobacco consumption continues being a worrying problem due to the negative consequences in the health. At presents, strategies of prevention based on the persuasion across clue pictures are used, which need to attract the attention of the smoker in order that they are effective. Nevertheless, the number of experimental studies in Spain on attentional biases in smokers is very limited. For it, in this study the aim was to verify the presence of visual attentional biases using the dot probe task in university smokers, stage where the smoking habit is consolidated. The sample was constituted by 337 students of the University of Huelva, with ages between 17 and 30 years. The participation was voluntary and the participants signed an informed assent. 135 subjects presented consumption history, which were distributed, according to classification of the WHO, in daily smokers, occasional smokers and former smokers. A experimental Ex post facto prospective design was used. The results showed that the smokers group was significantly later time to respond to the clue located in the same place that the tobacco picture than the group of not smokers. This shows that the smokers presented more difficulty to disconnect the attention towards smoking cues than not smokers.","366":"Alcohol abuse has numerous adverse health and social consequences. The consumer response to changes in alcohol affordability is an important issue on alcohol policy debates. Studies from many countries have shown an inverse relationship between alcohol prices and alcohol consumption in the population. There are, however, suggestions that increasing the price of alcohol by rising taxes may have limited effect on alcohol-related problems, associated with long-term heavy drinking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between alcohol affordability and alcohol-related mortality rates in post-Soviet Belarus. For this purpose trends in alcohol-related mortality rates (mortality from liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, alcoholism and alcohol psychoses) and affordability of vodka between 1990 and 2010 were compared. The time series analysis revealed that 1% increase in vodka affordability is associated with an increase in liver cirrhosis mortality of 0,77%, an increase in pancreatitis mortality of 0.53%, an increase in mortality from alcoholism and alcohol psychoses of 0,70%. The major conclusion emerging from this study is that affordability of alcohol is one of the most important predictor of alcohol-related problems in a population. These findings provide additional evidence that decreasing in affordability of alcohol is an effective strategy for reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.","367":"This study explores the prevalence of criminal behaviour in patients addicted to drugs who are in treatment. A sample of 252 addicted patients (203 male and 49 female) who sought outpatient treatment at a specialized centre was assessed. Information on criminal behaviours, socio-demographic factors, consumption factors (assessed by the EuropAsi), psychopathological factors (assessed by SCL-90-R) and personality variables (assessed by MCMI-II) was collected. Patients presenting criminal behaviour were compared with those who were not associated with crime for all the variables studied. The rate of drug-addicted patients with criminal behaviour in this sample was 60.3% (n = 150), and it was mainly related to traffic offenses, followed by drug dealing offenses. Significant differences were observed between patients with and without criminal behaviour. Patients with criminal problems were mostly men and single. Moreover, they were more likely to report poly-consumption. Furthermore, significant differences were observed on several variables: EuropAsi, SCL-90-R and MCMI-II. According to these results, patients with associated criminal behaviour presented a more severe addiction problem. The implications of these findings for clinical practice and future research are discussed.","368":"Pupillometry is becoming a relevant tool in Vision Sciences. So far, only a few studies have explored the relationship between pupil reflex measures and drug consumption. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of dynamic mesopic pupillometry as an objective measurement method for the detection of blood alcohol levels above the legal limit. In a quasiexperimental design, 19 volunteers were asked to participate in two conditions (before and after alcohol intake). In session with alcohol intake, participants were asked to consume 27.5 ml of alcohol in 60 minute intervals for four hours. Pupillometry records were conducted by means of the Power Refractor II, using four types of light stimulation: white (5600 K), blue (450 nm), green (510 nm) and red (600 nm). The basal diameter of the pupil increased significantly for alcohol concentrations equal to or greater than 0.25 mg\/l in exhaled breath. Moreover, the value of the amplitude for red light constriction also provided significant differences between the two conditions. These results are promising in the search for new methods to detect illegal alcohol levels among drivers. This study demonstrates that basal pupil diameter increase and amplitude response could be used as an alcohol consumption level indicator. However, further studies are necessary to validate this and other diagnose methods complementary to breathalyzer and other drugs tests.","369":"Over the last years, the therapeutic community treatment with people who have cocaine problems and psychopathological comorbidity has been increasing and it is important to know more about the success of these treatments. The aim of this paper is to study the psychopathological profile of cocaine-dependent patients and its association with outcome variables. It is interviewed by the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM-IV) and the Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID) a total sample of 218 patients who sought treatment at any of the six public therapeutics community of Andalusia (Spain). The results show that the retention rate after three months of 68.3% (149), 43.5% that leaves the resource with a therapeutic discharge and 52.8% with clinically significant changes. Besides, the 57.8% have psychopathological comorbidity. Finally, there is a higher treatment success (measured by days of stay, type of discharge and therapeutic community outcome clinical impression) among people without psychopathological comorbidity. These data show the need to adapt the therapeutic communities to treat people with comorbid psychopathology and, thus, improve therapeutic success.","370":"The objective was to quantify the prevalence of dual diagnosis and to evaluate the characteristics of these patients from community mental health and substance misuse services in Madrid. The sample consisted of 837 outpatients from Madrid, 208 from mental health services and 629 from substance misuse services. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Personality Disorder Questionnaire (PDQ4+) to evaluate disorders from axis I and II. It was considered that 517 (61.8%) patients had dual pathology (current diagnoses of axis I or II disorders and an addictive disorder): 36,1% in mental health services and 70,3% in substance misuse services. There were fewer males amongst the dual patients and it was also found that they had a worse employment situation, along with higher figures of alcohol and cannabis dependence than addicts without dual diagnoses (n=194). When comparing them with patients with mental disorder diagnoses only, excluding substance use disorder (n=126), there were differences in all socio-demographic characteristics analyzed, and dual patients were associated with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and had more suicide risk and different personality disorders. Thus, dual pathology is higher in patients who are in treatment and have differential characteristics (higher suicide risk, worse employment situation) that suggest greater severity that could be of help in the planning of care resource policies for these patients.","371":"The aims of this work were to analyse the relationships between sense of coherence (SOC) and substance use among Spanish adolescents and to examine the potential moderator effect of the patterns of substance use in the peer group. Sample consisted of 5475 Spanish adolescents aged 15 to 18 from the 2010 edition of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. Statistical analysis included cluster analysis to identify groups of adolescents according to their peer group's patterns of substance use and logistic regression with SOC and peers' pattern of consumption as predictors of current tobacco use, current alcohol use, life-time drunkenness and current drunkenness. The results showed that a strong SOC seemed to reduce the adolescents' likelihood of involving in tobacco use and drunkenness, but it was not associated with being a current drinker. In addition, the protective effect of SOC was moderated by peers' patterns of substance use. Specifically, SOC had a significant protective influence in adolescents whose peer group showed either a nonconsumption pattern or a pattern of frequent alcohol use and occasional drunkenness; but the protective effect of SOC disappeared if peers showed a pattern of consumption that included illegal drugs. In conclusion, SOC tends to act as a protective personal variable with respect to substance use during adolescence, but the influence exerted by the peer group seems to moderate the aforementioned protective effect of SOC.","372":"Colombia is not the same country of the 80s and 90s of last century. The big drug cartels disappeared, but their heirs diversified their activities, created alliances with guerrillas and paramilitaries, and increased the number of minors associated with criminal behaviours. The country has not been systematic in its drug abuse data collection, and there is a remarkable imbalance in the investments made on drug supply and drug demand: 98% and 2%, respectively. However, the official reports assert that there are at least 300,000 people in need of treatment. Regarding drug abuse, Colombia is in the \"middle range\" in Latin America, together with Peru and Mexico; Chile, Argentina and Uruguay are above them, and Ecuador and Bolivia below. Drug consumption was decriminalized in 1994, and the implication was that those involved in drug abuse problems had to find their way out by themselves; this implication contributed to the poor development of the state treatment system. In spite of a new law imposing the obligation of free treatment to everyone asking for it, the health system is on the border of collapse and won't be able to face those requirements.","373":"Alcohol consumption is a public health problem in Latin America, being responsible for thousands of annual deaths and millions of healthy life years lost to acute and chronic conditions caused by alcohol. Consumption is higher and more prevalent among men, but women and adolescent girls are increasing their consumption more rapidly than men and adolescent boys. Beer is the alcoholic beverage most consumed, followed by distilled spirits; however, there are countries differences as some countries drink mostly wine. The industry which produces, distributes and sells alcoholic beverages is powerful, mostly globalized and with great political influence, so the current situation favors commercial interests at the expense of public health. Public policies in Latin America are insufficient to respond to the situation at national level, with little o no regulatory control of the availability of alcoholic beverages, prices and taxation policies or government control of marketing and promotion. There is limited research which can inform policy actions. Gaps in prevention and treatment of alcohol consumption and related problems are discussed as well as some perspectives for the future.","374":"","375":"","376":"Given the benefits that exercise brings to physical and mental health, several authors have investigated its effectiveness as a treatment for various pathologies such as addictive disorders. The aim of this paper is to review the literature regarding the effectiveness of exercise as a complementary intervention for treatment of psychoactive substance dependence. To achieve this aim, a bibliographic search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library, TESEO and TDX. Those articles which evaluated the effectiveness of exercise on craving, withdrawal symptoms and abstinence rates were selected. Regarding nicotine dependence, those studies which evaluated the effectiveness of exercise for reducing weight gain after quitting smoking were also chosen. Seventeen articles met the selection criteria. The usefulness of exercise as a complementary strategy along with habitual therapeutic treatments for psychoactive substance dependence seems to be demonstrated, especially in nicotine dependence for the following variables: achieving or maintaining abstinence, and reducing craving or withdrawal symptoms. Further studies are nevertheless required, especially on illegal psychoactive substance dependence to be able to achieve conclusive results. We must also equally note that this kind of intervention is widely accepted by the drug using community, fact that would make of it a particularly useful tool in treating people with addictive disorders.","377":"The aim of the present study was to analyze: (a) the relationship between alcohol and tobacco use and academic performance, and (b) the predictive role of psycho-educational factors and alcohol and tobacco abuse on academic performance in a sample of 352 Spanish adolescents from grades 8 to 10 of Compulsory Secondary Education. The Self-Description Questionnaire-II, the Sydney Attribution Scale, and the Achievement Goal Tendencies Questionnaire were administered in order to analyze cognitive-motivational variables. Alcohol and tobacco abuse, sex, and grade retention were also measured using self-reported questions. Academic performance was measured by school records. Frequency analyses and logistic regression analyses were used. Frequency analyses revealed that students who abuse of tobacco and alcohol show a higher rate of poor academic performance. Logistic regression analyses showed that health behaviours, and educational and cognitive-motivational variables exert a different effect on academic performance depending on the academic area analyzed. These results point out that not only academic, but also health variables should be address to improve academic performance in adolescence.","378":"This paper aims to compare sexual behaviour and risk and protective factors between samples of adolescents who have sex under the influence of alcohol and those who do not, and to determine predictors factors for having had sex under the influence of alcohol. We analysed differences between these two groups in sexual practices, attitudes towards HIV, subjective norms and HIV knowledge. Drawing on survey data collected from 1216 Spanish adolescents aged 14-18 (M = 15.92; SD = .76), a subset of 297 sexually experienced participants was selected. Of these, 117 reported having had sex under the influence of alcohol in the past six months (51% girls). Adolescents who combined sex and alcohol engaged more in vaginal sex, oral sex and anal sex than those who did not. Having had sex under the influence of alcohol in the past six months was associated with negative attitudes towards condom use, when there are obstacles on using them, and less consistent condom use. There were no differences in knowledge about STIs\/HIV between both groups. Adolescents who combined sex and alcohol showed further characteristics associated with sexual risk. Preventive measures must address the particular characteristics of this risk group. Further evidence is need about alcohol effects on sexual behaviour.","379":"This cross-sectional study aims to determine lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders (including substance use disorders, -SUD and other non substance use disorders, -Non-SUD) among 289 young (18- 30 years) regular cannabis users, during the last year, in non-clinical settings in Barcelona. The Spanish version of the Psychiatric Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) was administered. Only 28% of the participants did not present any psychiatric disorder; while 65% had some SUD, the most common related to cannabis use (62%). Nearly 27% presented a non-SUD disorder. A younger age of initiation on alcohol use was associated with the presence of some SUD. Having consumed a greater number of \"joints\" in the last month was associated with the presence of both psychiatric disorders (SUD and non-SUD). While three quarters of subjects with non-SUD disorders had received some kind of treatment, only 28% of those with any SUD had received treatment. Given the low perception for need of treatment, there is a need for prevention strategies and to be able to offer therapies specifically tailored targeting young cannabis users.","380":"Interventions with relatives of alcohol-dependent patients have shown effectiveness in engaging unmotivated patients into treatment. The Federation of ex-alcoholics, in the Community of Madrid, has a network of self-help centers (Centers to Promote Psychosocial Alternatives against Addictions, CPAA) spread throughout the Madrid's region where alcohol-dependent patients and their families receive attention. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the integration of these facilities could improve the psychological condition of the relatives and the outcome on the patients' treatment. 188 patients attending the treatment program at \"Hospital 12 de Octubre\" and their relatives were randomized into two groups: Group A (n=94) (Standard program for patients and relatives delivered at our facility) and Group B (n=94) (where patients were treated with the standard program in our facilities and relatives attended a family group intervention at the CPAA) After 12 weeks, the CPAA conditions were significantly more effective than our standard program in improving psychological distress of relatives and in engaging patients into treatment. Patients belonging to group B had fewer drinking days during the treatment period. Our results support that psychological interventions delivered at CPAA centers are useful in improving psychological conditions of alcoholic patients' relatives than when undertaking the public alcoholism program. This intervention also improves outcome of alcoholic patients. The integration of these centers within public alcoholism treatment programs could provide a new way to treat alcoholism, based on collaboration of public facilities and patient associations.","381":"The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between physical exercise and sport activities with respect to tobacco consumption in adolescents according to gender. A total of 845 adolescents (412 males and 433 females) between 14 and 17 years of age enrolled in compulsory secondary education in Murcia (Spain) participated in the study. The International Physical Activity questionnaire was administered to all of them to determine their physical activity patterns, also the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance questionnaire was given to evaluate their smoking behaviors. The results show a significant relationship between physical exercise and sport activity and tobacco consumption. In addition, a clear gender difference was found on tobacco use. Among males, a positive and significant relation between practice of sports and physical activity and tobacco use was found; while no association between both variables was found among females. In conclusion, differences between men and women related to practice of physical exercise and sport and tobacco consumption are associated with the characteristics of the current models used to promote practice of sports as well as the different motivations among men and women to engage in physical exercise and sport activity.","382":"Alcohol consumption is often associated with violence against women. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between alcohol and other relevant variables in the intervention with men convicted of intimate partner violence, both at the individual and contextual spheres. Clinical symptomatology, Drug abuse, Impulsivity, Self-esteem, Assumption of responsibility, Intimate support perception, Social rejection perception, Accumulation of stressful life events, Income perception and Social support in community are assessed in a sample of 291 participants in an intervention program for men condemned for intimate partner violence. Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations and ANOVAs. Statistically significant differences were obtained among Risk consumers and Not risk consumers in Clinical symptomatology, Drug abuse, Impulsivity, Self-esteem and Attribution of blame to personal context as individual variables and Intimate support perception, Social rejection and Accumulation of stressful life events as contextual variables. Results of previous work are confirmed and the importance of considering social factors in the participants' environment when considering decreasing alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence is demonstrated. New tools for enhancing interventions in rehabilitation programs with men convicted for violence against women is provided.","383":"Alcohol consumption in Spain has traditionally followed the Mediterranean drinking pattern, featuring daily drinking with meals, beer as the preferred beverage, and comparatively little drinking to intoxication. Alcohol dependence (AD), one of the most detrimental disorders caused by alcohol, was prevalent in 0.2% of women and 1.2% of men, corresponding to 31,200 women and 186,000 men in Spain with AD in 2005 in the age group of 15 to 64 year. These prevalence estimates of alcohol dependence are likely underestimated due to limitations in the World Mental Health Survey which cannot be fully corrected for; however, the estimates of AD for Spain represent the most accurate and up to date estimates available. Alcohol creates a significant health burden in Spain with 11.3 premature deaths in women per 100,000 aged 15 to 64 years, and 40.9 premature deaths in men per 100,000 in the same age group were due to alcohol consumption (data for 2004). This amounts to 8.4% of all female deaths and 12.3% of all the male deaths in this age group being attributable to alcohol consumption. A large percentage of these harms were due to heavy alcohol consumption and AD. AD is undertreated in Spain, with less than 10% of all people with AD treated. For those who are treated, psychotherapy is the most utilized form of treatment to avoid relapse. If 40% of AD patients in Spain were treated with pharmacological treatment (the most effective treatment method), 2.2% of female and 6.2% of male deaths due to AD would be prevented within one year. Thus by increasing treatment rates is an important means of reducing the alcohol-attributable mortality and health burden in Spain.","384":"The debate over drug legalization appears frequently in the media as a potential solution to issues such as drug trafficking and other problems related to drug use. In Spain, private consumption or even the production of small quantities of certain plants, whose active ingredients are considered illegal drugs, if clearly for own consumption are not practices criminalized by any law. In addition, a drug addict is considered a person who is ill. Although it has not always been like that even in the countries that have called for this debate, where at times the law prosecutes consumers. The population of our country, according to the views expressed in the opinion polls, prefer to increase preventive measures, foster the treatment freely assumed by drug addicts and make stricter the repression on drug trafficking. Therefore, when speaking of \"legalization\" we should be scrupulous with the semantics; legalize and decriminalize are not the same, it is not the same decriminalize consumption than decriminalize trafficking, neither is the same decriminalize private consumption than public consumption. Decriminalize private consumption is a fact in our country. Beyond this, we advocate for the strict need to analyze from a scientific perspective the hypothetical benefits that would result from drug legalization. Certainly, from the public health perspective, they are hard to find. We believe that the same logic applied to tobacco, increasing the restrictions on its use, is the path to follow with any addictive substance.","385":"Best practice is the best application of available evidence to current activities in the drugs field. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) created a web-based tool aimed at bridging together scientific evidence and current practices in the drug addiction field. Beyond dissemination of evidence, the scope is to share best practice among the European countries. The synthesis of the evidence is based on the methods of the Cochrane collaboration (the Drugs and Alcohol Group) and the Grade working group. As of February 2013 the portal encompasses four modules on the effectiveness of demand reduction interventions, a collection of European projects on prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration and an inventory of European Guidelines and Standards including a bank of instruments to evaluate interventions (http:\/\/www.emcdda.europa.eu\/bestpractice). The summaries of evidence are presented in a plain language format and include brief explanation of the measures of effect supporting the evidence, but do not provide specific recommendations. The main future challenge of EMCDDA's best practice promotion is to become a service for those willing to implement best practice. The Best Practice Portal should become a platform where to find all is needed for successful implementation (handbooks, training materials, guidelines for evaluation and contacts for mentoring).","386":"Knowing which factors predict the use of psychostimulant drugs among youths is important for designing preventive programs and the identification of youths with the highest probability of use, to avoid some of the problems that can be derived from it. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between perceived availability, risk perception, personality traits, antisocial personality patterns, and use of other substances in the prediction of psychostimulant use. The sample was composed by 1,177 youths (584 males and 593 females) aged 14 to 25 in Spain, recruited randomly, stratified by lifetime use- non use of psychostimulants (cocaine or ecstasy). The path which best predicts psychostimulant use is: Personality traits-legal substance use-cannabis use-psychostimulant use. The next path is: Personality traits-antisocial personality patterns-psychostimulant use. Risk perception and perceived availability were significant in the prediction, but made a smaller contribution. The results of this study suggest that the model evaluated can predict psychostimulant use in youths. This model can be seen as a useful tool for developing preventive strategies and for identifying those youths that are at risk for problems related to drug use.","387":"There is growing concern to understand those interventions which when effectively implemented may bring reduction in the harms associated with recreational nightlife venues. Management of drinking environments vary across Europe and we are faced with the need to set standards across European countries. The aim of this study is to present evidence highlighted by literature to a diverse sample of European recreational industry representatives and other key stakeholders (74 participants in 14 European countries), to ascertain their judgements on level of implementation, acceptance, effectiveness and regulation to propose a set of standards be implemented in European recreational nightlife settings. Results revealed that most industry representatives display high rates of agreement with those preventive interventions deemed most important by evidence, including those concerning venue management, underage checkouts, staff training and collaboration with the police. However, participants expressed doubts on further regulation fearing it would mean further obstacles such as added paperwork and costs. Indeed, in countries were night-time economy is not well developed or is already suffering the impact of the economic crisis, we found that nightlife industry is not keen to adopt measures they may perceive to lower their incomes; while in countries where these practices are widely implemented, industry representatives were reluctant for these practices to be regulated or enforced since it would require a higher level of compliance. Regulating and enforcing the standards highlighted both by literature and industry representatives should be a priority to ensure promotion of health and safety in nightlife premises.","388":"The purpose of this research project was to study the relationship between drug consumption and sexual practices in teenagers in the city of Medellin, Colombia. A transversal studied was designed in order to identify the variables related to having had sexual intercourse under the effects of drugs or alcohol. The sample was made up of 955 teenagers between 14 and 17, who were in 9th, 10th and 11th grades in public and private schools in the city of Medellin. The results show that the prevalence of drug and alcohol influence in sexual intercourse is 43,67%. The most common drugs used for sexual practices are alcohol, marihuana, popper, cocaine and ecstasy. Consuming alcohol or drugs and having sexual practices shows an associated meaningful statistic (p= .001). The more common sexual practices under psychoactive substances are the exploratory ones (caresses and touching) (71%), vaginal penetration (63.67%), oral sex (45.30%) and masturbation (19.59%). Regarding the protection methods during sexual intercourse under drug or alcohol influence 55,9% always use a condom, 37,3% sometimes use it, and 6,8% never do it. This study proves what had been previously established by other research projects that show a high statistic association between drug consumption and sexual practices, but realizes that there is no statistically significant association between sexual practices under the influence of alcohol or drugs and the use or non-use of protective methods, which is the most important finding.","389":"The main aim of this paper is to identify the criminal and penitentiary pretreatment variables associated with re-entry into prison in a population of drug-dependent inmates who had been released from different prisons in Castilla and Leon (Spain) to finish their prison sentence in a Therapeutic Community. The study population was 120 male inmates. The documentary sources consulted for collecting information were the prison record, the classification and treatment protocol and the social record. These official records were consulted in the Burgos Penitentiary, responsible for custody of the documents. Applying a descriptive statistical analysis with contingency tables, the pre-treatment variables that showed the strongest association with re-entry into prison were family prison history, total sentence exceeding five years, imprisonments prior to the sentence in question, change to a higher security level, revocation of parole, breach of the terms of a sentence, completion of sentence in prison and, especially, age at first entry into prison between 16 and 21 years. It was confirmed through logistic regression analysis that the variable age at which participants entered prison for the first time is critical, given the impact that prison can have at an early age. These results provide a profile of the drug-dependent inmate at greatest risk of making poor use of measures alternative to prison.","390":"The aim of this study is to identify personal factors associated with drugs use and the practice of physical activity in a college student population in northwest Spain. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and April 2010 using a self-administered questionnaire including questions concerning gender, age, course and year of study, living arrangements and work. Participants were asked also about current tobacco use, alcohol drinking and heavy episodic drinking, illegal drugs use, and frequency of physical activity. Prevalences were calculated and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate separate models for the different habits making adjustments for the demographic variables. Most of students consumed alcohol (78.3%), with 31.7% consuming tobacco and 34% having used illegal drugs at some point. The prevalence of sufficient physical activity was about 22.7% and it was clearly lower in women and in courses no linked with sports. Women have been lesser consumers of illegal drugs and alcohol. However, heavy episodic drinking is clearly associated with women. Living with friends was noticed as a risk factor, both for tobacco use and the consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs, when compared with living at home. Courses of study connected with sport, health and education showed a lower prevalence of drug uses than the other courses analysed. Since distribution of drug use and insufficient physical activity depending on gender, living arrangement and the course of study, it would be appropriate to design more efficient interventions of health promotion take these differences into account.","391":"There are multiple factors that can affect the risk of tobacco use in adolescence. By analyzing these factors together we can disentangle the specific relevance of each of them in shaping teenagers' individual behavior. The goal of this research study is to deepen our understanding of the relationship between tobacco use in adolescence and socio-demographic and socio-emotional variables. We worked with a representative sample of 2,289 Catalan teenagers (aged 15-18) who responded to a questionnaire drawn up by the Families and Children Panel. Regression models were developed to assess the statistical associations of different mood states (sadness, nervousness and loneliness), peer-group characteristics and parenting styles, with tobacco use. The results indicate that addictive behavior is more likely when teenagers show negative mood states, controlling for socio-demographic variables and other risk factors. Among these additional factors, authoritative parenting styles reduce the risk of tobacco use, compared to authoritarian, permissive and neglectful parenting. Extensive tobacco use within the peer group is the risk factor most strongly associated with teenagers' individual behavior.","392":"Ekbom syndrome is a mental disorder in which the patient has the monothematic delusion of being infected by parasites. It is an uncommon condition that was initially studied by dermatologists. The exactly etiology is unknown to date, though several causes have been proposed, including metabolic diseases (among other physical causes), psychiatric disorders, drugs, etc. Research has now found a relationship between drug abuse and psychotic symptoms, which appear to be due to altered levels of dopamine at the receptor level. In this article we review the clinical features of the condition and present the case report of an intravenous methylphenidate abuser who developed a delusion of parasitosis.","393":"It is important to know which personality factors are associated with addiction so to distinguish addicts that require specialized treatment from those who do not, and to identify those addicts who achieve abstinence from those who continue their substance use despite the negative consequences. Cloninger's model includes biological and psychosocial variables that can be characterized in neuropsychological terms. Two samples were analyzed: individuals who had begun cocaine addiction treatment (n=183) and a non-clinical population sample (n = 183), matched for sex, age and educational level. Alcohol abuse\/dependence was monitored as an independent variable. Significant differences and large effect size were found between addicts and non-clinical population in Novelty Seeking and Self-Directedness, and to a lesser extent, in Harm Avoidance. These differences increase when problematic use of alcohol is added. According to the profile of traits, clusters of addicts were established and differences were obtained in variables such as functional\/dysfunctional impulsivity, dysexecutive symptoms and perceived stress. Six clusters were identified, some of minor severity, the most severely problematic clusters being characterized by higher levels of dysfunctional impulsivity, more dysexecutive symptoms and higher levels of perceived stress. Self-Directedness seems to reflect the deficit of prefrontal systems in the regulation of behavior, as well as in emotion and impulse control. It is proposed that evaluation of the personality is more useful than the mere assessment of symptoms for classifying addicts, determining their needs and designing a therapeutic itinerary.","394":"While it is well known that there is an interaction between sleep disorders and substance abuse, it is certainly more complex than was previously thought. There is a positive relationship both between having a substance use disorder and suffering from a sleep disorder, and vice versa. The effects on sleep depend on the substance used, but it has been shown that both during use and in withdrawal periods consumers have various sleep problems, and basically more fragmented sleep. We know that sleep problems must be taken into account to prevent addiction relapses. Recent research shows that the hypocretinergic system defined by neuropeptide hypocretin \/ orexin (Hcrt \/ ox), located in the lateral hypothalamus and involved in, among other things, the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, may play an important role in addictive behaviors. Different studies have demonstrated interactions between the hypocretinergic system, acute response to stress circuits and reward systems. We also know that selective optogenetic activation of the hypocretinergic system increases the probability of transition from sleep to wakefulness, and is sufficient for initiating an addictive compulsive behavior relapse. Hypocretinergic system activation could explain the hyperarousal associated with stress and addiction. Improved knowledge of this interaction would help us to understand better the mechanisms of addiction and find new strategies for the treatment of addictions.","395":"Hypersexual Disorder has been proposed as a new psychiatric disorder for DSM-V, characterized by an increased frequency and intensity of sexually motivated fantasies, arousal, urges, and enacted behavior in association with an impulsivity component. Excessive appetitive and consummatory behaviors, including hypersexuality, can become a non-chemical addiction. Sexual addiction afflicts people having paraphilic or nonparaphilic behaviors associated with progressive risk-taking sexual behaviors, escalation or progression of sexual behaviors (tolerance), loss of control and significant adverse psychosocial consequences, such as unplanned pregnancy, pair-bond dysfunction, marital separation, financial problems and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. The most common behaviors involved in sexual addiction are fantasy sex, compulsive masturbation, pornography, cybersex, voyeuristic sex, anonymous sex and multiple sexual partners. These behaviors are intended to reduce anxiety and other dysphoric affects (e.g., shame and depression). Axis I psychiatric diagnosis, especially mood disorders, psychoactive substance abuse disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, are common comorbid disorders with sexual addiction. There are significant gaps in the current scientific knowledge base regarding the clinical course, development risk factors and family history and data on women with sexual addiction are lacking.","396":"Relapse remains a common problem in disorders related to cocaine use. The aim of this paper is to review recent research data on the variables and factors related to relapse in cocaine-dependent individuals. We carried out a systematic search for studies including variables related to cocaine use in some of the most important national and international databases: PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library, IME and ISOC. To locate the latest research data, the search covered the period January 2000 to July 2011. Many and varied factors and variables identified with some predictive power were identified, notably psychosocial problems, negative emotional states, anxiety, self-efficacy, psychopathological comorbidity, addictive severity, and several variables related to the treatment process. Knowledge about the relapse process has increased considerably in recent years, but although the influence of certain factors on relapse in cocaine use now seems clear, specific research is still scarce and inconclusive.","397":"It is well known that various aspects of family functioning can influence children's drug use, both by promoting resilience and by increasing the risk of use. This review examines studies published in the last 30 years about the influence of family disorganization on children's drug use. Based on the results, we consider that disorganised families (charactirezed by parents' mental illness, parents' substance use and\/or non-intact families) are more likely to have children who are drug users, both legal and illegal. Finally, we stress the need to improve the conceptualization of family disorganization and its assessment, and point out other methodological limitations found in the empirical studies reviewed.","398":"Accumulated research evidence suggests that alcohol is a major contributor to premature deaths toll in Russia. The aim of the present study was to estimate the premature adult mortality attributable to alcohol abuse in Russia on the basis of aggregate-level data of all-cause mortality and alcohol consumption. With this purpose age-standardized sex-specific male and female all-cause mortality data for the period 1980-2005 and data on overall alcohol consumption were analyzed by means ARIMA time series analysis. As a result alcohol consumption was significantly associated with both male and female all-cause mortality rates: a 1 liter increase in overall alcohol consumption would result in a 3.9% increase in the male mortality rate and in 2.4% increase in female mortality rate. The results of the analysis also suggest that 41.1% of all male deaths and 27.8% female deaths in Russia could be attributed to alcohol. We can conclude that alcohol is a major contributor to the high mortality rate in Russian Federation. Therefore prevention of alcohol-attributable harm should be a major public health priority in Russia.","399":null,"400":"The aims of this study were: 1) To evaluate the predictive ability of cognitive beliefs about craving and alcohol use during treatment; and 2) To examine the course of cognitive beliefs, over a nine-month follow-up, as a function of comorbidity with personality disorders (PDs). Participants in the study were sixty-five alcohol-dependent patients initiating treatment at the Provincial Drug-Dependence Centre in Granada (Spain), 56.4% of whom had comorbid personality disorder. We administered the \"Questionnaire on beliefs related to addiction and craving\", taking number of alcohol-use episodes during treatment and degree of psychological adjustment as outcome variables. We used linear regression models to analyze the relation between questionnaire items and outcome variables, and related-samples t-tests to examine the course of beliefs throughout the follow-up. Results indicate that it is feasible to reliably measure a range of dysfunctional beliefs associated with addiction, that the degree of identification with these beliefs significantly predicts craving and alcohol use during treatment, and that the course of identification with these beliefs is considerably more irregular in alcohol-dependent individuals with comorbid PDs.","401":"The main aim of this study was to replicate and extend previous results on subtypes of adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD), according to their Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory for adolescents (MMPI-A) profiles. Sixty patients with SUD and psychiatric comorbidity (41.7% male, mean age = 15.9 years old) completed the MMPI-A, the Teen Addiction Severity Index (T-ASI), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), and were interviewed in order to determine DSMIV diagnoses and level of substance use. Mean MMPI-A personality profile showed moderate peaks in Psychopathic Deviate, Depression and Hysteria scales. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed four profiles (acting-out, 35% of the sample; disorganized-conflictive, 15%; normative-impulsive, 15%; and deceptive-concealed, 35%). External correlates were found between cluster 1, CBCL externalizing symptoms at a clinical level and conduct disorders, and between cluster 2 and mixed CBCL internalized\/externalized symptoms at a clinical level. Discriminant analysis showed that Depression, Psychopathic Deviate and Psychasthenia MMPI-A scales correctly classified 90% of the patients into the clusters obtained.","402":"Unplugged is a school prevention programme widely implemtend in Europe, with some positive evaluations. This research aims to measure the impact of this program on tobacco use by means of the lifetime and last-30-day tobacco use prevalence indicators and verify the duration of the intervention's measurable effect over time. The study was designed as a randomised controlled prevention trial. The intervention is based on the Comprehensive Social Influence model and consists of 12 lessons delivered to Czech adolescents in the 2007-2008 academic year. The prevalence indicators were calculated to assess the differences between the experimental (N = 914) and control (N = 839) groups on each outcome 1, 3, 12, 15, and 24 months after the end of the intervention. Data were collected using the 2003 version of the ESPAD questionnaire. As regards the 30-day smoking prevalence indicator, the tests performed after the completion of the intervention showed statistically significant differences between both groups in favour of the experimental one. Two years after the completion of the intervention the experimental and control groups showed 30-day prevalence rates of 26.7% and 33.1%, respectively (p = .01). The progression of smoking in the 30-day prevalence among the experimental group was significantly slower than that among the control group over the period of time. The differences in the lifetime prevalence rates were not statistically significant. The implementation of Unplugged resulted in a statistically significant measurable positive effect on tobacco use in Czech adolescents.","403":"Drug abuse is a serious public health problem. Moreover, co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders are common among drug users. This paper examines psychiatric disorders of young cocaine and heroin users using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). A cohort of 1266 young (18-30 years) current regular cocaine (705) and heroin (561) users were recruited outside the health services in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, Spain. The WMH-CIDI was used to evaluate mental disorders; the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) measured the degree of dependence; and the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire (FSSQ) assessed social support, in a crosssectional study design. About 43% was diagnosed with a lifetime mental disorder. The most common diagnoses were depression (37.5%) and specific phobia (6.8%). During the last 12 months, prevalence rates were also slightly higher in heroin group (26.4%) than in cocaine cohort (21.7%). Every day cocaine consumption, having unstable living conditions and low social support were variables highly associated with psychiatric morbidity in cocaine cohort. In heroin cohort, earning money through illegal activities was associated with psychiatric morbidity, while the moderate use of alcohol acted as a protective factor for mental pathology. Morbidity was associated to having received psychiatric\/psychological treatment during the last 12 months in both cohorts. This study has shown a relatively high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in cocaine and heroin users recruited in non-clinical settings. Future studies examining differences between cocaine and heroin patterns of consumption associated with mental diseases are necessary.","404":null,"405":"The emerging threat to public health posed by the use of human enhancement drugs has remained largely unrecognised. In attempts to become stronger, happier or smarter, or to look thinner, younger or more beautiful, people are turning to a diverse range of pharmaceuticals. The widespread availability of drugs with the potential to improve human attributes, appearance and abilities has generated a new and growing audience of users. Unlike users of drugs such as heroin, cocaine etc, users of human enhancement drugs do not necessarily perceive themselves as 'drug users'. Those attracted to these drugs may have little or no knowledge or understanding of the physical or psychological harm associated with these substances or their potential for addiction. In addition to the potent effects of many human enhancement drugs, there are considerable risks associated to the clandestine nature of the market. The growing number of untested, banned or adulterated drugs and the lack of safeguards and quality assurance in the illicit manufacturing process has resulted in serious harms and fatalities. The ease with which pharmaceuticals can be manufactured and distributed, combined with the significant profits that can be made from the illicit market, has resulted in a growing challenge for policy makers and health systems in many countries. This editorial aims to raise awareness of this emerging drugs situation and provide a brief overview of some of the drugs and their associated risks.","406":"There is no large prospective cohort studies using different therapeutic doses and standardized distal outcomes, however there is a fair amount of evidence on the effectiveness of methadone as a long-term treatment for the addiction to opiates. Strengths include less illegal drug use, decreased criminal activity and better general functioning. Also physical and mental health seems to be more preserved and recovered. Since patients undergoing methadone treatment exhibit diminished likelihood of suffering from cardiovascular conditions, HIV, HCV, HBV and other infections, and lesser psychiatric comorbidity. This Editorial intends to define and guide the therapeutic statement to address the management of persons with opiate abuse or dependence. These proposals have been grounded in the main long-term studies, systematic analysis and meta-analytic approaches on the effectiveness of methadone. Thereby it is recommended, with the maximum level of evidence, methadone maintenance treatments in spite of its weaknesses (ie. Toxicity, cardiovascular risk, sedation problems and cognitive impairment), considering the clinical history, general health status, and willingness and preferences of the patient.","407":null,"408":"Several neuropsychological studies have shown that chronic cannabis users have cognitive impairments, including decision-making process. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the process, through the somatic marker hypothesis in a sample of 41 cannabis users compared with a control group of equal size, and to analyze the influence of age, sex, education level, age of onset and amount of daily consumption. In order to do that, the software \"Cartas\" (similar to the Iowa Gambling Task), was used, implementing its two versions: normal and reverse. The results show significant differences between cannabis users and control group in the normal and reverse task execution. By block analysis, the control group obtained higher scores in the normal task execution, however, in the reverse task, the differences between groups are present in the initial task execution but not final task execution. None of the analyzed variables (age, sex ...) are significantly related to task performance. These results suggest the existence of alterations in the decision making process of consumers cannabis, which may relate to the difficulty in generating somatic markers, and not for insensitivity punishments insensitivity.","409":"A cross-sectional study was carried out with the purpose of validating seven life skills scales reported in the literature as related to drug-abuse prevention, and which identify differences between these skills among non-user adolescent students and users of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and inhalants. The sample was made up of 425 adolescents, 196 (46.1%) male and 229 (53.9%) female. These participants were randomly selected from a private high school in the state of Morelos, and their mean age was 15.8 years, with a standard deviation of 1.97. To measure skills we used the scales validated in this survey, while patterns of drug use were measured with a scale based on the National Addiction Survey (2008) indicators. Results showed that students who did not use alcohol, tobacco, cannabis or inhalants scored higher in skills of empathy, future orientation and peer pressure resistance, compared to those who had used these substances in the last month. On the basis of these findings it would seem necessary to develop drug-abuse prevention programs for high school students based on a life skills training approach.","410":"The mobile phone is a relatively new technological tool, versatile and accessible, and very attractive, especially for young people, but whose use involves a risk of abuse and addictive behavior. In recent years there has been increasing interest in this problem, especially in view of the fact that it involves an increasingly younger population. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of scientific knowledge about cell phone addiction\/abuse. To this end, a search was carried out in international databases, using the descriptors \"mobile phone\", \"cellular telephones\", \"addiction\" and \"abuse\", and focusing on prevalence studies, diagnostic tests, associations with psychological variables and gender differences. There is a conceptual vagueness about the concepts of abuse and addiction in relation to mobile phones, and wide disparity in the adoption of diagnostic criteria; moreover, there are numerous instruments for the assessment of these concepts. As a result, the estimated prevalence ranges from 0-38%, depending on the scale used and the characteristics of the population studied. Surprisingly, self-attribution of cell phone addiction exceeds the prevalence estimated in the studies themselves. The personality trait most consistently associated with addiction is low self-esteem, though extraversion is associated with more intense use. Women with low self-esteem are the most vulnerable group, and the most commonly associated psychopathological symptom was depression. In short, while the evidence suggests a problem in relation to mobile phone use, the vagueness of the cell phone addiction concept and the poor quality of the studies make it difficult to generalize the results. It is necessary to define and unify criteria with a view to carrying out quality studies that permit appropriate comparisons.","411":"The aim was to analyze the relationship between Cloninger's dimensions and Personality Disorders (PD) (with DSM-IV criteria) in opiate dependents. The study was Cross-sectional. The sampling of 196 patients with opiate dependence was consecutive. All were receiving treatment in an inpatient detoxification unit. Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), International Personality Disorders Examination (IPDE) and a Substance Use Questionnaire were used. Character's dimensions as Self-directness and Cooperation were related with PD when scored low. Opposite to Cloninger descriptions, high scores of Self-transcendence were related with presence of PD. Related to temperamental dimensions, cluster A was related with low scores of Reward Dependence (RD) and cluster C with high scores of Harm Avoidance (HA). Otherwise, in cluster B, while Borderline PD had high scores of Novelty Seeking (as high HA), the Antisocial PD only were related to low scores of RD. RD dimension seems useful to differ from presence or absence of Antisocial PD, also when alcohol consumption is considered. Cloninger's Model of Personality is useful in drug dependents for the definition of the different PD, as well as for probable PD's aggregation. This model also helps to create subtypes in opiate dependents as the antisocial or type II.","412":"Problematic use of the mobile telephone is an emerging phenomenon in our society, and one which particularly affects the teenage population. Knowledge from research on the problematic use of this technology is necessary, since such use can give rise to a behavioural pattern with addictive characteristics. There are hardly any scales for measuring possible problematic use of mobile phones, and none at all adapted exclusively for the Spanish adolescent population. The scale most widely used internationally is the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS). The aim of the present study is to adapt the MPPUS for use with Spanish adolescents. The Spanish version of the questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1132 adolescents aged 12 to 18. Reliability and factorial validity were comparable to those obtained in adult population, so that the measure of problematic mobile phone use in Spanish teenagers is one-dimensional. A prevalence of 14.8% of problematic users was detected.","413":null,"414":"A recent theoretical approach describes addiction as a dynamic behavioural change process on the impulsivity-compulsivity axis. However, on the basis of current evidence, it is still difficult to establish a selective association between the course of addiction and individual transition along this axis. The aim of this study is to categorize each of the individuals in a sample of cocaine-dependent patients (CDI) as mainly impulsive or mainly compulsive, on the basis of their performance in neuropsychological inhibition and perseveration tests, and to test the association between the assigned category and their scores in trait impulsivity, and severity of cocaine addiction (measured by means of self-report assessment tools). A total of 42 CDI and 65 healthy control individuals (HCI) were assessed using the UPPS-P Scale (to explore trait impulsivity), the Stroop and Go\/No Go (to assess response inhibition), and Revised-Strategy Application and Probabilistic Reversal tests (to assess response perseveration). Forty-five per cent of the CDIs were classified as compulsive, and this subgroup scored significantly higher than the impulsive group on the UPPS-P dimensions of lack of perseverance and lack of premeditation. A substantial proportion of CDIs can be classified as compulsive. No differences between compulsive and impulsive CDIs were found with regard to severity of exposure to cocaine; however, patients classified as compulsive by means of neuropsychological tasks are less perseverative in the pursuit of long-term objectives and more prone to make under-meditated decisions, as shown by trait impulsivity assessment questionnaires.","415":"Drug addictions are complex disorders that require multiple approaches, including the use of pharmacotherapies. Currently, these therapies are based on \"small\" molecules or chemicals that penetrate the blood-brain barrier, reach the brain, and produce their effects on neurotransmitter systems. Unfortunately, they often do not have the desired efficacy or may cause undesirable side effects, especially at the central nervous system (CNS) level. A novel approach is the use of biologics to treat drug addictions. Biologics are usually complex and \"large\" molecules, which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and, thus, have no CNS effects. In principle, it appears that the efficacy of biologics to treat drug addiction is by preventing the access of the drug of abuse to the brain, preventing the activation of brain reward systems, and eventually producing the extinction of addiction. Biologic therapeutics includes immunotherapies, such as vaccines or antibodies, as well as enzymes. New products as well as new and more efficient methods of production, are offering vast opportunities to advance the discovery and development of biologics to treat addictions as well as drug overdose. These products include new vaccines with greater specificity and ability to produce antibodies, new methods and techniques to produce vaccines and antibodies, as well as new enzymes with high efficiency to metabolize cocaine. The purpose of the article is to provide a general overview of the development of biologics for the treatment of drug addictions and overdose.","416":"The Environmental Enrichment (EE) paradigm is a housing condition which aims is to provide physical, cognitive and sensorial stimulation to rodents. Animals are housed in larger cages containing inanimate objects such as tunnels, toys and running wheels. The main aim of the current work is to tackle the arguments which suggest that EE may diminish vulnerability to developing addiction to nicotine and other drugs of abuse and to review recent experimental studies performed in relation to this subject. We discuss the major changes induced by EE at physical, neurobiological and behavioral levels and review the results of recent studies which indicate that EE promotes both neurochemical (potentiation of the increase in dopamine release induced by nicotine in the brain cortex) and behavioral changes (increased ability to discriminate the presence of reward and decreased impulsivity), thus supporting the hypothesis put forward. In light of these results, EE can be proposed as a model for the study of vulnerability to addiction to different drugs of abuse, including cocaine and nicotine, though further studies are needed in order to establish the neurobiological implications of the effects of exposure to enriched environments and their possible relationship with changes in brain reward systems.","417":null,"418":"The emotions predispose to action providing information from both internal and external environment. There is evidence indicating that the emotional response in drugdependent patients is different from that of the not consuming population. The present work analyzed the emotions of drugdependent under ambulatory treatment (N=57), following the Lang's theory of emotion, considering the dimensions of valence, arousal and dominance or control, across the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), individually applied. The results were contrasted with a control group of not consuming persons (N=44) of similar age, since this variable concerns emotional experience. The influence of sex was also analyzed, considering the possible differences between men and women in emotional experience. The results can be summarized in the following points: (1) There were significant differences between substance abusers and not consumers in the dimension of valence, valuing the consumers the emotional stimuli of the most extreme form (the agreeable ones as better, and the disagreeable ones as worse); (2) there were no differences between both groups in the arousal and dominance dimensions; and (3) women reported more arousal before aversive images, and less before the sexual ones, than males, independently of they were or not substance abusers. Finally, it is suggested the need to deep into the analysis of sex differences and into the images selected, as well as into the usefulness of the emotion centred therapies for the treatment of drugdependency.","419":"Impulsivity is a stable correlate throughout the course of drug addiction. However, it has always been studied as a negative condition, linked to psychopathology. Dickman (1990) proposed two subdimensions of impulsivity, dysfunctional (DI) and functional (FI). He defines the latter as the tendency for rapid, goal-oriented decision-making characterized by well calculated risks. Only a few studies have attempted to differentiate between these two subdimensions using classical neuropsychological tests. Fifty two drug addicts in treatment were tested using Dickman's Impulsivity Inventory and a battery of classical neuropsychological tests. FI shows moderate to high correlations with many classical neuropsychological test scores in relation to enhanced executive functioning, whereas DI reveals surprisingly weak and scarce correlations with indicators of impaired executive functioning. DI appears to be a trait related to some difficulties in classical neuropsychological tests, while FI emerges as a consistent and much stronger predictor of higher attention capacity, lower distractibility, better precision, fewer errors, and better maintenance of goal-oriented strategies. Thus, functional impulsivity is related to positive conditions and more efficient cognitive functioning. Implications for the treatment of drug addictions are suggested.","420":"Cannabis is a widely used substance among adolescents and young adults, but demand for help and treatment from this age group continues to be low. It is therefore essential to develop instruments especially designed for the early detection of problems associated with cannabis use in this population. The purpose of this work is to adapt and validate the CPQ-A (Adolescent Cannabis Problems Questionnaire) for its use as a screening instrument in Spanish population. The sample was made up of 144 young people (71.5% male) aged 16 to 20 (M = 17.12; SD = 1.17) who had used cannabis in the last month and were on some kind of study or training course at various educational institutions in Asturias (a region in northern Spain). Factor analysis of the CPQ-A in this sample provides evidence of a unidimensional structure, with a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.86 for the questionnaire. The evidence also shows that the instrument's convergent validity is good. The CPQ-A score permits discrimination between moderate and excessive cannabis users over the last month, is positively related to score on the CAST (Cannabis Abuse Screening Test), and presents adequate sensitivity and specificity for identifying cases of cannabis abuse and dependence according to the DSM IV-TR criteria. It is also sensitive to young people's degree of concern about cannabis use and the psychopathological effects associated with it. In accordance with the results obtained, the CPQ-A can be considered a useful screening tool for young cannabis users with problems.","421":"Research shows that drugs and delinquency are frequently linked, the abuse of various types of substance being a widespread practice among young offenders. At the same time, some psychosocial characteristics are associated with both drug abuse and criminal\/antisocial behavior. To help us explore the relationship between young offenders' drug abuse and certain psychosocial variables, we examined closed judicial files on young offenders from the Juvenile Justice Service in Jaen (Spain) corresponding to the period 2001 to 2010. From the contents of these judicial files we analyzed demographic variables such as gender and age, as well as psychosocial variables such as drug abuse, peer group, violent behavior, self-control, tolerance to frustration and attributional style. The results show that most of the young offenders use some type of drug, as well as revealing differential patterns of use according to gender. Also observed is a link between drug abuse and deviant peer group, violent behavior and the above-mentioned psychological variables. Finally, we found some differences in these psychological variables depending on the type of drug used.","422":"It has been repeatedly emphasized that alcohol provides the most plausible explanation for both the high rate of cardiovascular mortality rate and its dramatic fluctuations in Russia over recent decades, while other traditional risk factors identified in epidemiological studies have little predictive value. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality rates in Russia. A ge-standardized sex-specific male and female IHD mortality data for the period 1980-2005 and data on overall alcohol consumption were analyzed by means of ARIMA time series analysis. The results of the analysis showed that alcohol consumption was significantly associated with both male and female IHD mortality rates: a 1-liter increase in overall alcohol consumption would result in a 3.9% increase in the male IHD mortality rate and a 2.7% increase in the female IHD mortality rate. As a conclusion, the results of this study provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the drastic fluctuations in IHD mortality in Russia over recent decades are related to alcohol, as indicated by the close temporal association between number of deaths from IHD and overall alcohol consumption per capita.","423":null,"424":"The aim of the study was to show whether there was a connection between drug use and Eating Disorders, as well as to identify the type of drugs most widely used and to ascertain whether they are used to suppress appetite. An \"ad hoc\" scale was developed using the items of the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale, whose aim is to detect cases at risk of certain types of eating disorder, and items for assessing drug use. This scale was applied to samples of teenagers (n=446) aged 13-18 from various secondary schools in the Valencia Region (Comunidad Valenciana) in Spain. An association was found between teenagers that use drugs, and particularly between the variable \"use of some kind of drug as an appetite suppressant\", and being at risk of having an eating disorder. Tobacco was the drug most commonly used (accounting for 66% of those within the risk threshold of the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale). We conclude that those teenagers from the sample who fall within any of the risk thresholds consume more drugs than those who do not fall within the risk threshold of the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale. Stimulant-type drugs are those most widely used by these teenagers with the aim of suppressing appetite.","425":"Drawing on an analysis of data from over 30 cohort studies, it can be estimated that between 10.000 and 20.000 opioid users die each year in Europe. Typically, annual mortality rates are between 10-20\/1000, representing an excess mortality 10 to 20 times greater than expected. Most deaths occur among males in their mid-thirties. Four broad categories of cause of death can be identified: overdoses, diseases, suicide and trauma. While the long term trend in HIV related mortality among drug users is downwards, other causes of mortality have shown little sign of decreasing in recent years. Of particular concern are overdoses which account for 6300 to 8400 deaths reported annually. The fact that deaths have not decreased is surprising given the scaling up of treatment and other services. Opioid substitution treatment in particular is known to be protective and the numbers of those in substitution treatment in Europe has increased dramatically. A number of interrelated factors may help explain this intractable problem. These include: the possibility of an aging cohort becoming more vulnerable; the use of alcohol and other drugs; high levels of ill-health, risk behaviour, and co-morbidity; and social exclusion and marginalisation. Reducing overall morbidity among heroin users remains a key issue for Europe's public health services. More efforts are required to better understand and target both the direct and indirect factors associated with mortality among problem drugs users, if this major health cost associated with drug consumption is to be reduced.","426":"This study focuses on the problematic situations adolescents have to face resulting from their own alcohol use. These situations were described according to their type and frequency of occurrence, and possible explanatory variables were explored. In particular, we considered the effect of perceived peer intake of alcohol, social and family permissiveness, patterns of use and parental norms. The sample comprised 9276 adolescents from nine cities and municipalities in Colombia, with an average age of 14. Results indicate that the most common problematic situations experienced by the adolescents are: getting drunk, vomiting, and having problems at home or with one's boyfriend or girl friend because of the drinking. As in previous studies, the behavior of peers is associated with severity of the drinking-related problems experienced by the adolescents. The study also suggests that easy access to alcohol is related to the perception that their peers use it, and appears to be more closely associated with the possibility of accessing alcohol at parties and among friends than with the perception that it is easy to buy it. It was also found that excessive drinking habits were associated with greater likelihood of negative consequences, that in Colombia the presence of alcohol use in the family is associated with fewer reports of extreme and difficult situations, and that having problems at home because of alcohol use is associated with a larger number of problems such as drunkenness and vomiting, among others.","427":null,"428":"The population strategy for intervention on risk factors became known through the work of Geoffrey Rose in the field of public health and preventive medicine in relation to cardiovascular diseases in the late twentieth century. Currently, one of the risk factors with the most impact on health is the smoking epidemic. The aim of this study is to describe and put into practice the preventive medicine strategies proposed by Geoffrey Rose in the control of this smoking epidemic. To illustrate the situation, we have used the data on salivary cotinine concentration from a representative sample of the adult population in the city of Barcelona. In conclusion, public tobacco control policies worldwide should take into account the utility of the population strategy for addressing this important health issue, without ignoring \"high risk\" interventions of proven effectiveness.","429":"Tobacco companies' strategies to promote tobacco use and undermine tobacco control policy are key in tobacco use among young people. The analysis of tobacco companies' internal documents can be instrumental in identifying those strategies, improving social support for tobacco control policy, and planning public health interventions. The goal of this study was to identify and analyze internal documents related to the activities of tobacco companies during the 1980s and 90s aimed at promoting smoking in young Spaniards. Electronic search by key word of tobacco industry documents held at the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. More than 1,000 documents were identified and reviewed, including letters, messages, memos, and other documents. Seventeen documents related to the objective of the study are analyzed and discussed. Tobacco companies funded and conducted activities aimed at maintaining high smoking incidence and prevalence in Spain. These activities, which included research, cigarette and packaging design, promotion, and social and political manipulation, may have had an impact on current levels of tobacco use in Spain. ","430":"Alcoholic patients show a high mortality rate. We know about the increased mortality of outpatients following specialized treatment for alcohol abuse and inpatients with organic diseases related to alcohol, but it is not clear whether alcoholics with a comorbid psychiatric profile also die prematurely. To investigate clinical characteristics, therapeutic evolution, survival, and factors that can better predict mortality. 14-year longitudinal monitoring of 91 patients hospitalized in 1993 for detoxification in a psychiatric unit and who subsequently received outpatient treatment. Patients show a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders (40.6%) and multiple periods of previous treatment (78%). After 14 years the mortality rate was 34.1%. Deceased patients more often presented cognitive decline and were more often on pensions. They were also taking more antidepressants, had less family support and were more likely to have relapsed into alcohol use. Many of the factors that predict higher mortality are age-related. In younger patients, the presence of neuropsychological deterioration symptoms may indicate a premature organic disorder and probably greater risk of treatment failure, poor physical care and traumatic physical and mental situations, all of which would also increase the likelihood of premature mortality. ","431":"Introduction Recent pharmacotherapy findings from new alcohol reduction programmes could change the paradigm of alcohol-dependence treatment. This study reviews the neurobiological background and pharmacotherapy of alcohol-dependence disorder, focusing on opioid receptor antagonists, abstinence-oriented treatment and moderation-oriented treatment. 1. Alcohol-dependence treatment programs show only low to moderate efficacy. 2. Patients usually show low motivation to sustain abstinence but high motivation to reduce alcohol use. 3. A treatment program based on continued reduction of drinking and associated with intermittent treatment with naltrexone can be useful for low-severity alcohol-dependent patients. Although high severity alcohol-dependent patients should stop drinking alcohol, low severity patients may have the option of reducing their alcohol consumption if they take an opioid antagonist medication every day that they decide to drink alcohol. In the short term, the continuing drinking-reduction programmes may reduce the number of drinks per drinking day and in the long term, they may progressively decrease the obsession for drinking, alcohol seeking behavior, and related medical, behavioral and social disorders. To change the paradigm in the treatment of alcohol-dependence disorder there is a need for further randomized controlled trials in order to assess their efficacy and tolerability. ","432":"In Spain, the Therapeutic Community (TC) constitutes a common model of treatment in the field of addictions, although there hardly exists any investigation about its efficiency and the persistence of its attainments. To evaluate the short, half and long term effects of treatment of addiction to alcohol or cocaine in the TC run by \"Fundacion Salud y Comunidad\" (Foundation Health and Community). descriptive pilot study, with a sequential design of cohort. 91 users completed a survey specifically designed to know their evolution at different follow-up periods (1, 3, 5 or 10 years after their exit from the TC): socio-demographic, psychoactive substance use, other variables related to the stay at the TC. Changes between before the TC and the present time regarding variables such as academic, labour, drug consumption, health, family and social adaptation and their criminal behaviour are described. the cohorts showed a relatively common previous socio-demographic pattern having received a similar treatment. The users reported to have diminished the frequent consumption of the main drug, having 48.9% never relapsed even through an occasional consumption of the drug\/s. Also they perceived to have improved their health and family relations, as well as their aggressive behaviour and legal problems linked with their consumption of drug\/s. after their rehabilitation in a TC, the users report a global decrease of the consumption of drugs and perceive an improvement of their health, family relations, violence and other problems linked to their former drug use. ","433":"The somatic marker hypothesis proposes that certain body signals guide decision-making processes in an adaptive direction. To see the influence of these markers on decision-making we used the Iowa Gambling Task, through which several studies have shown impaired decision-making in drug-dependent patients. To assess the performance of a sample of drug-dependent patients in a task that is sensitive to the measurement of decision-making process, so as to see whether there are significant alterations, and to compare the performance of these patients with that of non-users (in the normal and inverted versions). The sample consisted of 66 people (33 addicts and 33 control participants). We used a semi-structured interview on socio-demographic variables and two versions of the \"Cartas\" task, a computerised version of the Iowa Gambling Task. Result. Significant differences were found between the control and experimental groups in execution of the normal task, but not of the inverted version. In total, 75.76% of the drug-dependent patients showed impaired task performance, as against 24.24% who performed it correctly. The results indicate the presence of alterations in the decision-making processes of drug-dependent patients, who did not perform as well as the control group. This may be due to difficulty in generating somatic states according to possible future consequences (myopia about the future) in patients addicted to drugs. ","434":"Addiction is associated with changes in brain activation patterns. In recent years new techniques of neurostimulation that can alter the activity of brain circuits have been developed, and are being explored in the treatment of addictions. The most important of these techniques are Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Transcranial Direct Electrical Stimulation (tDCS), Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). The findings reported are clearly still insufficient for them to be considered as therapeutic alternatives in substance use disorders.","435":"This study appraises the results of an intervention to prevent drink-driving in a cohort of pre-drivers in the region of Catalonia (Spain). The program applied, based on attitude change, sets out to reduce significantly the risk of being involved in drink-driving. A classic quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with control group was used, and two questionnaires were applied: a general one measuring several risk factors, and another one specifically addressing the question of alcohol. The study was carried out with three groups: a) experimental 1, which received the entire program, b) experimental 2, which received a part of the program, and c) control, which did not receive the benefits of the program. Results from the factor analysis (PCA) and the repeated-measures ANOVA suggest that young pre-drivers who received the program obtained better results in road safety and showed less risk of drink-driving than those who did not receive the program or received only part of it. Significant differences were also found between men and women. The results confirm the effectiveness of the attitude-change program and the possibility of reducing alcohol use among young pre-drivers.","436":"To evaluate retrospectively the comorbidity of mental and addictive disorders in community mental health and substance misuse services in Madrid. The medical records of 400 patients from mental health and substance misuse services in Madrid were evaluated. Records were examined for the last 20 patients from each service unit. Dual pathology was constituted when a current diagnosis of mental and addictive disorders, excluding nicotine addiction, appeared on the patient's records. Prevalence of dual pathology was 34%. There were differences in the prevalence figures for the two kinds of service: 36.78% in substance misuse services, and 28.78% in mental health services. There was an association of dual diagnosis with alcohol or cocaine dependence, but not with opioid dependence. The mental disorders more prevalent in dually diagnosed than in non-dually diagnosed patients were mood disorders, personality disorders, and schizophrenia. There is a high prevalence of dual pathology in those seeking treatment, being higher in substance misuse services than in mental health services, and higher in patients with alcohol or cocaine dependence. These findings could be of help in the planning of care resource policies for these patients. ","437":"This study analyzes the relationship between a multidimensional measure of self-concept, the Self-concept Form-5 Questionnaire (AF5), and drug use among adolescents. From the responses of 632 participants (47.5% females) aged 12 to 17 years (M = 14.88 years, SD = 1.71 years), results showed negative relationships between family, academic and physical self-concept, and drug use. Although a positive relationship between social self-concept and drug use was found, this significant relationship disappeared once the age and sex of adolescents was controlled statistically. Moreover, the study includes other adjustment indicators in adolescence (psychological adjustment, personal competence, antisocial behavior and parenting). Results support the idea of self-concept as an important correlate of psychological well-being and a basic theoretical construct for explaining adjusted and adaptive behaviors in adolescence. Likewise, our results underline the need for statistical control of the effect of a third variable (sex), which could explain some contradictory results reported in the literature (a positive relationship between social self-concept and drug use), so as to avoid reaching conclusions based on spurious relationships. self-concept, multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, adolescence, psychosocial adjustment, drug use.","438":"The goal of this study was to determine the evolution of variables such as quality of life, craving, or psychological adjustment during treatment in a sample of 65 patients with alcohol-dependence disorder, 56.3% of whom also presented a personality disorder (PD). Five measurements were taken over the course of the treatment, at 3-month intervals. The analysis of tendencies of the variables craving, quality of life, and psychological adjustment assessed at the five assessment points revealed that the cognitive-behavioral treatment influences each one of these variables differently: a quadratic and cubic relation was identified for craving, whereas for quality of life there were linear, quadratic and cubic relationships in its diverse scales depending on the time point in question, and for psychological adjustment there were linear and quadratic relationships. At the end of treatment, the patients assessed presented significantly higher levels of quality of life than at the beginning, but the results showed that, although the patients with PD had better perceived quality of life at three months, it was lower over the entire course of the treatment compared to patients without PD. It was also found that quality of life and craving at the start of the treatment predicted alcohol use during the first three months. The implications of these results are discussed with a view to psychological intervention with alcohol-dependent patients.","439":"This study examines the addictive, criminal and psychopathological profile of a sample of 59 women incarcerated in the Villabona prison in Asturias (a region in northern Spain). The instruments administered were the EuropASI, the SCL-90-R and a semi-structured interview. Results showed that the profile is a young, single women with family dependents serving an average of 5 years' imprisonment. Of the total sample, 64.4% met criteria for a substance abuse disorder. We found a statistically significant relationship between the variables use-nonuse and type of crime: women who used substances had committed the most crimes against property and against the socioeconomic order. As regards psychopathology, 44.06% of the sample fulfilled the requirements for clinical case according to Derogatis' (1994) criteria. The results of the SCL-90-R showed that the predominant psychological disorders were, in the following order, depression, somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoid ideation. Moreover, in the group of female users, 47.4% had dual pathology. Our results revealed a statistically significant relationship between clinical case and substance use. Finally, statistically significant differences were found between the user and nonuser groups in the EuropASI severity profile. Highest scores were found for the medical, psychiatric and family areas in the user group.","440":"Traffic accidents, sexually-transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, drunkenness, and drug use (especially psychostimulants) are negative aspects associated with recreational nightlife. The aim of the present study is to analyze in a sample of 1214 young people (aged 15-25; 49.7% males, 50.3% females) whether psychostimulant users (cocaine and ecstasy) have a higher frequency of drunkenness and risk behaviours related to sex and to driving. We also analyze the importance of these behaviours in the prediction of psychostimulant use in the last year. The results indicate that psychostimulant users get drunk more frequently, are more likely to have seen a relative drunk, and present more risk behaviours in the contexts of driving and full sexual relations. Therefore, cocaine and ecstasy users are a risk population who need specific preventive programs.","441":"High accidental deaths rate in the former Soviet republics (FSR) and its profound fluctuation over the past decades have attracted considerable interest. The mounting body of evidence point to binge drinking pattern as a potentially important contributor to accident mortality crisis in FSR. The aim of this study was to estimate the aggregate-level effect of binge drinking on the accident mortality rate in the former Soviet Slavic republic Belarus. Trends in fatal alcohol poisoning (as a proxy for binge drinking) and accidental deaths rates from 1979 to 2007 were analyzed employing a distributed lag analysis in order to asses bivariate relationship between the two time series. According to Bureau of Forensic Medicine autopsy reports the number of deaths due to accidents and injuries increased by 94.5% (from 38.7 to 75.6 per 100.000 of residents), and fatal alcohol poisoning rate increased by 108.6% (from 12.8 to 26.7 per 100.000 of residents) in Belarus between 1979 and 2007. Alcohol in blood was found in 51.4% victims of deaths from accidents and injuries for the whole period, with the minimum figure 43.1% in 1986 and maximum 59.1% in 2005. The outcome of distributed lags analysis indicated statistically significant association between the number of alcohol poisoning deaths and the number BAC (blood alcohol concentration)- positive deaths from accidents and injuries at zero lag. The outcome of this study supports the hypothesis that alcohol and deaths from accidents and injuries are closely connected in culture with prevailing intoxication-oriented drinking pattern. This research evidence points to binge drinking pattern as a potentially important contributor to accident mortality crisis in Belarus. ","442":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and percentages of personality patterns, and explore their relationship with clinical syndromes in a sample of 212 pathological gamblers from a rehabilitation center. The study also explores the possibility of profiles, common in gamblers, in which personality disorders and clinical syndromes coexist. The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMIII) was employed. Four clinical personality patterns were the most frequently identified: dependent, obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic and antisocial. The relationship between personality patterns and clinical syndromes was also analyzed. Subsequent cluster analysis revealed two personality profiles, with features belonging to different scales, called \"antisocial profile\" and \"obsessive-compulsive profile\". These two profiles differ considerably in their relation to clinical syndromes. The \"antisocial\" group scores significantly higher on all clinical syndromes, and close to the clinical score in the cases of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, psychotic thinking and delusional disorder.","443":"Democratically organised societies have to find ways how to proceed when in need of a reformulation of strategies in face of new societal and technological developments, especially in dealing with controversial preferences and interests. The area of drug policy change presents an excellent example for discussing the problem and the process of coalition building for finding acceptable answers to new challenges. Modern sociological theory has developed concepts and tools for a description and analysis of such processes. Some concrete case studies from Swiss cities are available as a basis for advanced discussion of theoretical concepts. The observational description of the coalition building in the city of Zurich helps to illustrate the inherent elements, problems and outcomes; a more detailed process analysis focuses on the initial phases and further development of the various formal and informal coalitions, introducing the importance of shared objectives for action and the need for concerted activities. A clear policy concept and a consistent action plan were not available at first, but they proved to be an important step in the consolidation of what was a non-systematic beginning. What started at local level and led to a new national policy was not so much a continued clash between two ideologies - harm reduction versus strict prohibition -, but was the beginning of a new thinking about how the various policy elements could successfully work together in the pursuit of a shared concrete objective. These observations may be considered in further theory development and policy considerations.","444":"Dual diagnosis is the co-occurrence of a substance abuse disorder and a psychiatric condition. Gender has been found to be associated with differences in prevalence of mental disorders as well as outcome, prognosis and treatment-seeking. Articles published in Medline, Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports up to December 2009 that examined gender, prevalence and clinical characteristics of dual-diagnosis patients aged over 18 were reviewed. The distribution of Axis I disorders by gender is similar for dually diagnosed patients and single-disorder patients. The prevalence of psychotic and bipolar disorders is higher in men, whereas anxiety and affective disorders are more prevalent in women. Dually diagnosed females with psychotic disorders do not show better prognosis than men. Finally, polydrug use among dual-diagnosis individuals is more prevalent in males. ","445":"The Multidimensional Alcohol Craving Scale (MACS) and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) with (123)I-iodobenzamide ((123)I-IBZM) can be useful tools for assessing relapse risk in early recovery from alcohol-dependency. The aim of this study was to assess possible relationships between MACS score, (123)I-IBZM binding and time to first heavy drinking day (TFHD) after detoxification treatment. Nineteen alcohol-dependent in-patients were evaluated by MACS scale and an 123I-IBZM-SPECT, performed following alcohol detoxification treatment. At discharge, participants were advised to take naltrexone 50 mg\/day for relapse prevention. TFHD was assessed over a 12-week follow up. The MACS score at the beginning of the detoxification process and naltrexone treatment after detoxification were independent predictive factors for TFHD. The MACS scale is a better predictor of TFHD than IBZM binding. It is simple, non-invasive and inexpensive and appears to be a useful instrument both for clinical practice and for research. ","446":"6-month naturalistic, open-label trial to compare amisulpride versus topiramate and naltrexone as a treatment for patients with alcohol dependence, with assessments at enrolment and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. 274 alcohol-dependent patients who had been drinking heavily during the past month were included. Once detoxified, patients were assigned to one of three treatment groups (naltrexone 50 mgr per day, topiramate 200 mgr per day or amisulpride 100 mgr per day). Patients were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Outcome was measured using tools that assessed alcohol intake (EuropASI and Alcohol Timeline Followback), craving (OCDS), disability (WHO\/DAS), and quality of life (EQ-5D); changes in biomarkers of alcohol intake were also noted. at the 6-month follow-up patients taking amisulpride had poorer results than those taking topiramate in direct measures of alcohol intake (OCDS, alcohol intake, number of drinks per day and heavy drinking days), but no significant differences were found in these measures on comparing the amisulpride patients with those taking naltrexone. in this study, amisulpride, at a dose of 100 mgr per day, was less effective than topiramate, at a dose of 200 mg per day, but as effective as naltrexone, at a dose of 50 mg per day, for reducing alcohol intake and craving over the period of the study. ","447":"This study addresses, from theories of associative learning, the impulsivity and craving in patients with a diagnosis of substance dependence in abstinence, habitual use and relapse. We present a new method for the assessment of desire based on discount curve self description, in which patients describe how they perceive the temporal evolution and intensity of their desire. At the same time, through a brief questionnaire about emotion and desire -developed by the authors-and the Plutchik Impulsivity Scale, we set out to check whether positive or negative emotions increase, decrease, or are uninvolved in changes of desire and impulsivity. Perception of the evolution of desire in patients from the Relapse and Habitual Use groups is similar and presents a hyperbolic curve, but the Relapse group presented greater impulsivity. Moreover, a relationship is found in patients from the Relapse group between the hyperbolic increase of desire, the pleasurable states and impulsivity. The higher scores on impulsivity and the hyperbolic evolution of desire in patients who have recently suffered a relapse indicate the need to consider and specifically address these aspects as relevant to psychotherapy and\/or pharmacological therapy.","448":"To describe the relationship between personal values and personality traits in cocaine-using patients and analyze their specificity in the explanation of different types of constructs. A study was carried out to explore the association between these variables in a group of 230 patients receiving treatment for cocaine dependence. The Portrait Values Questionnaire was used for measuring personal values, while the Big-Five Factors Questionnaire was used to measure personality traits. In addition, we explored the relationship of values and traits with the variables \"degree of satisfaction with life\" (life satisfaction) and \"belonging to a religious association\" (religiosity). A significant association was found between personal values and personality traits. At the same time, their conceptual and empirical differences were revealed, as it was demonstrated that personal values better explain \"belonging to a religious association\", whilst personality traits better explain \"degree of satisfaction with life\". Thus, it was found that personal values better explain behaviours that depend on greater cognitive control, while personality traits would have more influence on tendencies and behaviours that are subject to lower cognitive control levels. Considering the relationship between the two constructs, and given that cocaine use is associated with both high and low cognitive control, in explanations of cocaine use it would be appropriate to take into account the explanatory contribution of personal values and personality traits in a complementary way. ","449":"Craving has been defined as the motivation to self-administer a substance previously consumed. It has been hypothesized that craving contributes significantly to compulsive drug use and relapse after a period of abstinence in humans. Neuropsychological and brain-imaging studies have identified numerous brain regions that may be involved in craving. In this paper, the neuropsychological mechanisms of craving for nicotine are reviewed, focusing on three systems that appear to be involved in craving states. First of all, the reward system, responsible for the development of dependence and craving. Secondly, the emotional and associative system, which is related to conditioned craving. And third, the system involved in the neural basis of cognitive and decision making processes. The most influential theoretical models on craving are also reviewed, including those based on conditioning mechanisms, on cognitive mechanisms and on cognitive-behavioral mechanisms, as well as the neurobiological model. Factors related to the evaluation and treatment of craving are also discussed, with particular emphasis on clinical aspects. Finally, we stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for achieving a common model on craving and improving the diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.","450":null,"451":"In the WHO region Europe, the average unrecorded adult per capita alcohol consumption was 2.67 L pure ethanol in 2005, which is 22% of the total consumption of 12.20 L. Despite concerns about potential health harms from the chemical composition of unrecorded alcohol, there are surprisingly few data on the problem in the European Region. This study reports the results from the Alcohol Measures for Public Health Research Alliance (AMPHORA) project, which assessed the quality of unrecorded alcohol in a Europe-wide study. Samples of unrecorded alcohol were collected in 16 European countries and chemically analyzed for potentially health-relevant parameters. Thresholds for parameters were defined based on potential health hazards of daily drinking. The average alcoholic strength of unrecorded wine products was 14.9% vol, and 47.8% vol in unrecorded spirits. One half of the samples (n=57) showed acceptable alcohol quality. The other half (n=58) showed one or several deficits with the most prevalent problem being ethyl carbamate contamination (n=29). Other problems included copper (n=20), manganese (n=16) and acetaldehyde (n=12). All other parameters (including methanol, higher alcohols, phthalates) were only seldom problematic (limit exceedance in less than 10 samples). The price of unrecorded alcohol was approximately 45% of the price of recorded alcohol. The major problem regarding unrecorded alcohol appears to be ethanol itself, as it is often higher in strength and its lower price may further contribute to higher drinking amounts. Compared to the health effects of ethanol, the contamination problems detected may be of minor importance as exposure will only in worst-case scenarios reach tolerable daily intakes of these substances. ","452":"","453":"Adolescents go through changes in their neurobehavioural and psychosocial functioning that can result in their desire to conform to peer norms taking predominance over cognitive impulse control mechanisms. This can help explain why, when peers are present, adolescent behaviour may not be significantly modified by what they know about risks and consequences. This finding has implications for prevention as it points to the importance of responses that actively target the environment in which substance use takes place, and where social norms are formed and supported. In practice however, across Europe information-only prevention approaches - despite a weak evidence for their effectiveness - continue to be most commonly used. Why this is the case is the question addressed by this editorial. A definition for environmental prevention is also provided: as strategies that aim to alter physical, social and economic environment without relying on persuasion. Boundaries of the definition with health promotion are discussed and the available evidence for the efficacy of this perspective reviewed, as is the information on the availability of environmental prevention within Europe. These data do not support the contention made by some member states that their prevention strategies are comprehensive and cover all addictive substances. Overall, although environmental approaches are becoming more common, they are disproportionately found in the North of Europe, and are most noticeable in three areas: at the macro-level in tobacco bans and alcohol policies, in strategies to improve the school environment and ethos, and in local level policies to regulate recreational settings.","454":"Affective psychoses include those disorders with psychotic and affective symptoms described in the DSM-IV-TR. In these pathologies, the prevalence of nicotine dependence is very high. The objective here is to carry out a review of the relation between nicotine use and psychiatric disorders considered as affective psychoses at the epidemiological, clinical, prognostic and treatment levels. We review studies published in the PubMed database that include the keywords smoking, tobacco, nicotine and schizoaffective or bipolar disorder. Comorbidity of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder with nicotine consumption is 66-82.5 % and 67%, respectively. On the basis of this review it can be concluded that smoking results in poorer prognosis and greater clinical seriousness of bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. Use of other substances, psychiatric diagnosis, clinical seriousness and caffeine consumption are risk factors for nicotine use. The most effective treatment approach is pharmacological treatment in combination with psychological interventions. The first-line medication for tobacco detoxification and dishabituation are substitution therapy (transdermal patches, sprays, sublingual tablets, sucking pills or nicotine chewing gums), varenicline and bupropion. The medically indicated treatment for psychotic symptoms is atypical antipsychotics, due to their better tolerability profile and better results in smoking cessation.","455":"Review of the concept of adolescent binge drinking in order to propose an operational definition. We conducted a literature review in the databases MEDLINE and PSYCLIT for the period 1980 to 2009. Through the filter \"(binge drinking OR heavy-episodic-drinking) AND (adolescence OR university-students OR college-students)\" 80 articles were selected for review. Epidemiological studies that have reported the prevalence of binge drinking show a lack of consensus regarding the operational definition. Alternative approaches have been proposed in relation to the number of standard drink units (SDUs) consumed per occasion, frequency of episodes and their duration. A proper definition of the pattern of intensive alcohol consumption should integrate the quantity and frequency variables, and also take into account the negative consequences associated with it. The criterion most widely accepted by the international scientific community is the consumption of 5 or more SDUs - 4 or more for women - on a single occasion at least once in the last two weeks. However, aspects such as differences in the grams of alcohol of SDUs hinder the establishment of an international definition of the term, making it necessary to adapt this approach to the country in which the study is being carried out. ","456":"To investigate the predictive ability of \"core addiction-related beliefs\" and \"craving-related beliefs\" on the desire to take drugs based on the cognitive model of addiction. In addition, we analyzed more in depth the influence of duration of abstinence on the degree of identification of participants with these beliefs and the intensity of craving. We used three different questionnaires in order to measure: the intensity of the craving experienced by participants, and the degree to which they identify with \"core addiction-related beliefs\" and \"craving-related beliefs\". The sample was made up of 130 drug abusers with different main drugs of choice, course of addiction, duration of abstinence and gender. The \"core addiction-related beliefs\", together with clinical variables such as the main drug of choice and the duration of abstinence, significantly predicted the intensity of craving experienced by participants. The intensity of craving and the degree to which participants identify with \"core addiction-related beliefs\" and \"craving-related beliefs\" differed significantly as a function of duration of abstinence; this effect was due to the fact that patients with shorter abstinence periods were more likely to endorse these beliefs. \"Core addiction-related beliefs\" can significantly predict not only intensity of craving but also the degree to which participants identify with \"craving-related beliefs\". \"Core addiction-related beliefs\" constitute the best predictor of intensity of craving across treatment, and may therefore be highly relevant for difficulties in controlling craving, as proposed by the Beck cognitive model of addiction. This association may help to explain why some patients have a persistent desire to take drugs even after protracted abstinence, when a lack of desire for drugs would be expected. ","457":"Data show that 92.5% of prison inmates report drug or alcohol use. In spite of this, only 2% of dual diagnosis research has been carried out in the prison context. Therefore, the aim of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to analyze the profiles of dual diagnosis in a Spanish prison and test the feasibility of two assessment instruments. The sample was made up of 152 drug-addicts imprisoned in the Villabona Penitentiary Center (Asturias, Spain) who volunteered to be interviewed. The sixth version of the Addiction Severity Index and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview - MINI- were used for the assessment of inmates' psychopathological status and drug problems. The results show that, in general, the offender's profile is: male, 34 years old, unmarried, with children and with an average time spent in prison of approximately five years. Only 4.5% of respondents did not use drugs at the time of the study. In the remainder, the most widely used substances are cocaine (37.6%), heroin (29.9%) and alcohol (10.8%), with 52.7% reporting having used drugs in the last month. With regard to psychopathological state, only 12.9% have no associated disorders, and the most prevalent symptoms correspond to antisocial personality disorder (65.6%), risk of suicide (45.2%), depression (35.9%) and anxiety (25.5%). The instruments proposed (ASI-6 and MINI) are feasible tools for detecting addiction severity and associated psychopathology in this context. ","458":"Addiction is a complex disorder of brain function, which involves primarily the frontal cortex as a structure responsible for the organization of intentional behavior. The performance of everyday life activity is one of the key factors in assessing the impact of cognitive impairment. There are no validated instruments in Spanish applicable to addicts for assessing self-perceived efficacy in the performance of everyday activities. Based on the Occupational Self-Assessment, a questionnaire was developed for the exploration of: perceived level of performance quality, evaluation of competences and the influence of environment on performance. For the study, a sample of 425 non-clinical participants and 300 patients treated for substance addiction was used. The Occupational Performance Self- Report (ADO) has 37 items and showed adequate internal consistency (Alpha = 0.93, 0.75 and 0.87 for the subscales) and a stable structure in confirmatory factor analysis. The self-assessment of performance showed consistent correlation with dysexecutive symptoms in daily life (-0.54 &lt; r &lt; -0.66). The ADO emerges as a reliable and valid instrument for the exploration of self-perceived level of performance in the everyday lives of individuals with substance addiction, and may be useful for establishing treatment goals in conditions of high ecological validity.","459":"To study the risk of pathological gambling and its possible relation with mental disorders and school and family problems in a population of school pupils from the city of Medellin (Colombia), with a view to providing guidance for mental health care. Cross-sectional study; sample comprises 3486 students aged 10 to 19 years selected from all the educational institutions in the city. The sample is probabilistic and represents an estimated population of 290,000 young people from Medellin. The SOGS instrument (South Oaks Gambling Screening) was used for screening risk and likelihood of problem gambling. The analytic stage assessed possible associated factors such as mental disorders, alcohol use and drug use, with statistical significance levels of 5% and prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 48.6% were without problems, 37.6% were at risk and 13.8% were possible pathological gamblers. Males were more at risk than females (2.5:1), and the highest proportion of possible pathological gamblers was in the 10-14 age group (58.7%), vs. the 15-19 group (41.3%). Pathological gambling in young people is associated in this study with: anxiety OR=2.1(1.69-2.60), depression OR=1.73(1.33-2.24), suicide attempt OR=1.85(1.20-2.85), impulsivity OR=3.48(2.85-4.26), violent behavior OR=4.64(3.57-5.58), and problems at school OR=2.46(1.97-3.06); recent use of cigarettes, drunkenness and illegal drugs (use\/addiction) were identified as associated risk factors, p value: &lt;0.05. Pathological gambling risk is high in this young population, and is associated with mental disorders, use of psychoactive substances, and school and family problems. This situation suggests the need for large-scale and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic intervention measures for addressing the problem. ","460":"Monitoring health-related behaviors in adolescence requires instruments capable of providing valid data The objective of this paper is to review and assess existing information sources on smoking and alcohol and cannabis use by age and sex among adolescents in Spain. A search was carried out for studies with repeated observations over time, and their methods and characteristics reviewed. For each study, the number of surveys, their frequency and their sample size are assessed, as well as the instrument used, the available indicators, and the availability, accessibility and comparability of the information. Five sources of information providing data over extended periods of time with accessible data are identified: the National survey on drug use in secondary-school children (Encuesta estatal sobre uso de drogas en estudiantes de secundaria; ESTUDES); the Health behavior in school-aged children study (ECERSHBSC); the Monitoring system for risk factors associated with non-transmissible diseases in young people (Sistema de Vigilancia de Factores de Riesgo Asociados a Enfermedades No Transmisibles dirigido a poblacion juvenil; SIVFRENT-J); the Study of risk factors in secondary school children (Estudio de factores de riesgo en estudiantes de secundaria; FRESC); and the Monitoring study of health behaviors in adolescents (Estudio de monitorizacion de las conductas de salud de los adolescents; EMCSAT). Two of the surveys cover the whole of Spain, one is regional, and two are city-specific. All use solid methods and representative sampling techniques. In some, changes have occurred that make comparison of the evolution of some indicators difficult. Report accessibility is variable; comparability is limited for some surveys. Some provide almost no stratified data. There are valuable sources of data, but all have shortcomings. Changing the measurement instrument in a survey for comparison with others raises dilemmas as to the internal comparability of series. ","461":"There is a close relationship between substance abuse (alcohol and other drugs) and intimate partner violence. Studies carried out with male offenders and with addicted patients show a high comorbidity rate between these two phenomena. However, few batterer intervention programmes have been implemented to date in the field of drug addiction. This paper proposes, first, the need to detect cases of intimate partner violence that are camouflaged beneath a drug problem. Thus, it is important to determine the prevalence rate of intimate partner aggressors among users of drug-addiction treatment programmes, as well as identifying the specific characteristics of these patients. Second, once aggressors are identified, it would be possible to develop specific programmes for the simultaneous treatment of the two problems (addiction and intimate partner violence). Some studies have already been carried with joint treatments for addiction and intimate partner violence. The results obtained are encouraging, and show that intervention programs with addictions can be a useful framework for applying also, where necessary, specific treatments for those addicted patients with an associated problem of intimate partner violence. Finally, implications for clinical practice and future research in this field are discussed.","462":"Motivational Interviewing (MI) has proved to be effective with a wide range of addictive behaviors. However, in the case of tobacco smoking it is more difficult to demonstrate its effectiveness. MI provides specific motivational strategies for each stage of change. The aim of this paper is to review studies investigating the use of MI in the treatment of smoking in order to provide an update on its effectiveness. To this end, we reviewed the most important research published internationally and in Spain. A review of 33 selected studies leads us to conclude that it is very difficult to assess and compare the results of the studies in view of their variability and heterogeneity. Hence, it is in this area that we see the most contradictory results on its effectiveness. We therefore need more research in order to determine its reliability and possible explanations for the discrepant findings observed in studies of smoking cessation. Finally, we strongly suggest the need to know which treatment location is best, how MI functions in treatment programs and which conditions may affect its effectiveness.","463":"Alcoholic men and women have differential characteristics. It has been discussed whether alcoholic women have specific and additional difficulties that require extra study. However, these differences may imply an advantage for some aspects of treatment. data from eleven published studies of alcoholic patients are reanalyzed from a gender perspective. to gain better knowledge of gender differences and their therapeutic implications. women present more suicidal attempts than men, but these attempts are less lethal and have less intentionality. Personality structure is similar in the two sexes, but women have better prognosis, even if they present psychiatric disorders. A notable characteristic of women's prognosis is their better adherence to group therapies. Women diagnosed with severe alcohol dependence who need inpatient treatment for detoxification are usually younger and have higher rates of benzodiazepine abuse and personality disorders than men, but are also more collaborative, and benefit more from therapy. Female benzodiazepine abusers show lower rates of neurocognitive impairment than men. Alcoholic women with severe organic conditions that require inpatient treatment usually have a medical record with more unsuccessful treatment attempts for alcohol dependence than men, and their prognosis is equally unfavourable. alcoholic women may have psychological mechanisms that facilitate higher abstinence rates and lower mortality rates than men. Future research for improving knowledge of such mechanisms, which are related to emotional factors such as guilt, depression and anxiety, and traditionally considered as problematic, may indicate that they actually increase motivation to change. ","464":"The use of potentially addictive substances may be influenced by the young person's place of residence. To determine the frequency and characteristics of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use in secondary school pupils in a small urban area during the academic year 2008-09. Cross-sectional survey. Socio-demographic data related to tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use were gathered by means of a confidential self-administered questionnaire. The survey was responded to by 88% of the pupils (393). Prevalence of tobacco use was 48%, 16% of whom smoked every day. Forty four percent of third grade pupils and fifty two per cent of forth-graders, did consume alcohol on the week ends. Thirty-five percent said that they had been drunk on at least one occasion, while 30% of the pupils had tried cannabis, and 50% of third-graders. Among those who had used cannabis, 23% had done so in the previous month. At onset of cannabis use was 13 years. Almost 80% of those surveyed said they had not paid for the first drugs they used. The use of legal and illegal drugs for those in our sample begins between the ages of 12 and 14 years, representing slightly higher frequencies than those found in big cities. Despite the illegality of the sale of tobacco and alcohol to minors, Spanish teenagers continue to obtain them. It is essential for primary care professionals, educators and families to be aware of the importance of early detection of the use of psychoactive substances. The prevention of drug addiction is more effective the sooner the potential risk is detected. ","465":null,"466":null,"467":"High violent mortality rate in Russia and its profound fluctuation over recent decades have attracted considerable interest. A mounting body of evidence points to the binge drinking pattern as a potentially important contributor to the violent mortality crisis in Russia. In line with this evidence, we assume that higher level of vodka consumption in conjunction with binge drinking pattern results in close aggregate-level association between vodka sales and violent mortality rates in Russia. To test this hypothesis, trends in beverage-specific alcohol sales per capita and mortality rates from external causes in Russia between 1980 and 2005 were analyzed by means of ARIMA time-series analysis. Results of the analysis indicate that violent mortality rates tend to be more responsive to change in vodka sales per capita than to change in total level of alcohol sales. The analysis suggests that a 1-litre increase in vodka sales per capita would result in a 5% increase in violent mortality rate, an 11.3% increase in accidents and injuries mortality rate, a 9.2% increase in suicide rate, a 12.5% increase in homicide rate, and a 21.9% increase in fatal alcohol poisoning rate. The outcomes of this study provide support for the hypothesis that alcohol played a crucial role in the fluctuation in violent mortality rate in Russia in recent decades. Assuming that drinking vodka is usually associated with intoxication episodes, these findings provide additional evidence that the binge drinking pattern is an important determinant of the violent mortality crisis in Russia. ","468":"The aim of this study is to obtain knowledge about habits related to addictive behaviour (pathological gambling, Internet, compulsive shopping, use of mobile telephones, etc.) that may be displayed by young students at the University of Cordoba (Spain), and to relate this behaviour with variables such as age, sex, course year, macro-field of study (arts\/sciences) and the consumption of substances such as alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and cocaine. Using an ex-post facto single-group design (Montero &amp; Leon, 2007), we applied a questionnaire especially designed to gather socio-demographic information on substance use and behavioural patterns related to \"non-substance\" addictions, which included the Shopping Addiction Test, Echeburua's Internet Addiction Test (2003) and Fernandez-Montalvo and Echeburua's Short Pathological Gambling Questionnaire (1997). A total of 1,011 students participated in the study (42.7% males and 57.3% females), with an age range of 18 to 29. Significant differences were found between mean score on the questionnaires and variables such as age, sex, field of studies and course year. It would seem that being female is a protective factor for Internet and gambling addiction, being a sciences student is a risk factor for gambling addiction, and being older and being an arts student are risk factors for shopping addiction. In conclusion, it can be stated that the students surveyed showed moderate incidence of behaviours such as Internet browsing, gambling, shopping and mobile phone use, whilst a very small group are close to having an addiction problem with such behaviours.","469":"The aim of this study is to analyse the factors related to the use of addictive substances in adolescence using association rules, descriptive tools included in Data Mining. Thus, we have a database referring to the consumption of addictive substances in adolescence, and use the free distribution program in the R arules package (version 2.10.0). The sample was made up of 9,300 students between the ages of 14 and 18 (47.1% boys and 52.9% girls) with an average age of 15.6 (SE=1.2). The adolescents answered an anonymous questionnaire on personal, family and environmental risk factors related to substance use. The best rules obtained with regard to substance use relate the consumption of alcohol to perceived parenting style and peer consumption (confidence = 0.8528), the use of tobacco (smoking), cannabis and cocaine to perceived parental action and illegal behaviour (confidence = 0.8032, 0.8718 and 1.0000, respectively), and the use of ecstasy to peer consumption (confidence = 1.0000). In general, the association rules show in a simple manner the relationship between certain patterns of perceived parental action, behaviours that deviate from social behavioural norms, peer consumption and the use of different legal and illegal drugs of abuse in adolescence. The implications of the results obtained are described, together with the usefulness of this new methodology of analysis.","470":"Implants and depot injections (DI) of naltrexone (NTX) have undergone considerable development since the first commercially available implants appeared in the mid-1990s. In particular, long-acting implants that can deliver relapse-preventing serum NTX levels for around six months have now been subjected to classic randomised controlled trials that have given positive and generally significant results when compared with oral NTX and placebo implants, or with standard post-detoxification care. They also provide lower serum levels that can prevent opiate overdose for several additional months and 3-year mortality rates are similar to those of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). At least 18 months of antagonist-assisted abstinence may be desirable to normalise new, opiatefree cognitive-behavioural habits and extinguish old, maladaptive ones. We discuss ideological antagonisms between protagonists of MMT and of NTX implants, notably in Australia, but we argue that both treatments can and should co-exist. The main obstacle to the expansion of longacting implant treatment is not the lack of an evidential or theoretical base but the lack of a licensed product. NTX appears to block all opiates if serum levels are adequate and we stress its apparent lack of clinically significant hepatotoxicity. Some patients may need above-average serum levels and occasionally, habitual injectors continue to inject opiates despite experiencing no opiate effects.","471":"To analyze the methodological design of long-term longitudinal studies of alcoholics who have undergone treatment. Systematic review of prospective longitudinal studies of treated alcoholics with follow-up periods of at least 8 years, and published in English, during the period 1983-2009. The review includes 9 studies which analyzed: follow-up evaluations, information sources, the period of reference in the final assessment, the measurement of alcohol use, the operationalization of drinking patterns, and data analysis. 2434 patients (ranging between 57 and 850 per study) were studied on average for a period of 15.3 (D.T. = 3.2) years (range 8-20 years). Studies differ in the number of intermediate evaluations (0, 1, 3, 4) and the length of the period considered for the final evaluation (the whole period, the last 3 years, the last year, last 6 months, last month or present situation). Drinking patterns tend to be used as the main outcome variable, but they are operationalized in non-equivalent forms and the analysis is performed using classical cross-sectional statistical techniques. Alcoholism evolution is studied by analyzing the evolution of drinking patterns and patients' life situation during the period under study. The scarce amount of data available on the evolution of treated alcoholism cannot be compared across studies due to considerable methodological differences. There is a need to promote common methodological criteria in relation to follow-up strategies. New statistical methods that permit longitudinal analysis for non-balanced and correlated data should also be incorporated. ","472":"This article examines the analysis of drug use among Secondary Education students in Andalusia from two different studies: the Health Behavior in School-aged Children Study (HBSC), in its 2006 edition, and a study assessing the implementation of the Prevenir para Vivir (\"Prevent to Live\") drug use prevention program in the education field. To this end, on the one hand the paper analyzes the use of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis among Andalusian adolescents on the HBSC Study, and on the other, selects two groups of adolescents to examine and compare their drug use: a group from the HBSC Study who had not participated in any drug use prevention program and in whose schools the staff had not received training in relation to these issues (called HBSC Control Group), and a group of adolescents who had participated in the Prevenir para Vivir drug use prevention program working with specialized staff (called Prevenir para Vivir Experimental Group). The results indicate, first, higher levels of drug use in older students than in younger ones; and, second, on comparing the two groups, that adolescents who have received drug prevention programs with specialized staff are not always those most likely to present healthier drug use. These results must therefore be interpreted as offering only limited support to drug use prevention programs.","473":"The aim of this paper was to describe the psychopathological and personality profile associated with cannabis dependence in young adults and to compare it with those of non-addictive disorders and the normal population. The sample consisted of 141 cannabis-dependent subjects attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic, 140 psychiatric patients with non-addictive disorders and 140 subjects from the general population chosen to match the patient samples for age, gender and socioeconomic level. All participants were assessed with different instruments related to personality (Impulsiveness Scale, Sensation-Seeking Scale and STAI) and psychopathology (SCL-90-R, BDI, STAI and Inadaptation Scale). Patients from the clinical groups presented more anxiety and depression symptoms than healthy participants, and had more problems adjusting to everyday life, but there were no differences between the two clinical groups. Cannabis-dependent patients were specifically characterized by low educational level and by the presence of paranoid ideation; they were also more impulsive and sensation-seeking than those from the other two groups. We discuss the implications of this study for clinical practice and for further research.","474":"For many years now, Neuropsychology and the Psychology of Personality have developed in parallel, without any attempt to integrate the knowledge provided by the two disciplines. This paper sets out to analyze the relationship between the presence of symptoms in daily life related to the functioning of the brain's frontal lobes and individuals' personality patterns. The Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX-Sp), the Frontal System Behavior Scale (FrSBe- Sp) and the Inventory of Temperament and Character Revised (TCI-R) were administered to 421 non-clinical participants and 246 individuals in treatment for substance abuse or dependence. Significant correlations were found between symptoms for all frontal syndromes (mesial, dorsolateral and orbital) and some personality traits (novelty seeking, harm avoidance and self-directedness), even more than 50% of the variance being predicted. Results suggest that frontal performance should be seen as a continuous dimensional variable, ranging from optimal to non-adaptive performance, without a neat cut-off point. Addiction would be related to an increase in frontal symptoms, both mesial (apathy) and orbital (disinhibition), as well as dorsolateral (dysexecutive syndrome), and this would result in changes in the previous personality pattern. These data seriously question the supposed genetic basis of temperamental traits, and suggest hypotheses of great relevance for clinicians.

Retrospective, single-center study of consultations at the Montevideo Poison Control Center between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. One hundred and thirteen consultations were included, with an average age of 22 years (+ - 0.5 years) and a female-male sex ratio of 1:4.3. The consultations were related to drug overdose (77%), suicide attempt (16.8%), and wanting to give up CBP use (6.2%). In 48.1% the time elapsed since inhalation of CBP was less than 6 hours. Doses varied between 0.5 gr. and 25 gr. Use of other drugs at the same time, such as alcohol, marijuana or benzodiazepines, was common (51 cases). The symptoms most frequently observed were neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular, followed by respiratory symptoms. In 16.8% of patients, reason for the consultation was intentional acute ingestion of drugs, considered as a suicide attempt, occurring within a few hours of drug consumption. CBP users are mostly young males. Although clinical findings are compatible with those for cocaine abuse, euphoria is a major clinical feature in CBP abusers. The presence of respiratory symptoms reflects the complications associated with the ingestion route. Suicide attempts occurring within a few hours of CBP confirm the high prevalence of suicidal ideation reported by other authors. cocaine base paste, clinical features, suicide attempts.

Cross-sectional descriptive study. 117 9th-grade classes in 39 schools (2812 students). The information was gathered by means of a self-report questionnaire for teachers and families. A descriptive analysis was made of the implementation of the intervention in the classrooms and of the families' participation. Teachers' response rate was 65%. Discussion was the method most widely applied (100% of the classrooms) and DVD was the most widely used material (93.4%). Skills training was applied in 72.4% of the classrooms. In 59.2% of the classrooms there was an acceptable intervention (at least 8 of the 16 preventive activities), while in 38.2% there was a qualified intervention (at least 1 activity for each general lesson and 2 for each specific one). Mean score given to the program by teachers was 7.4, and 81.6% of them reported their intention to apply it again. Participation rate of the students' families was 28.3% (796). The intervention was acceptable in two out of three classrooms, while in four out of ten the protocol was applied strictly. Greater participation of the students' families corresponded to those schools in which the intervention was better implemented.

Delphi consensus method, implemented from September 2007 to March 2008 by means of three rounds of interviews with questionnaires administered by electronic mail to 39 professionals. The Panel of experts was made up of Dispensers and Prescribers of methadone as well as Coordinators of welfare services from the Methadone Treatment Program (MTP). Selection criteria were: Being in active employment with a minimum of 3 years experience. Sample diversification variables: Professional role, geographical environment and type of habitat. Recruitment: By means of key professional bodies from different institutions. 48 improvement opportunities were identified. Thirteen of these obtained a high level of agreement in the final round. According to the EFQM model, the dimensions that obtained the most consensus in relation to improving the care service were: Leadership, Alliances and Resources. The dimension that caused the greatest disagreement was Processes.

The PDSQ (Zimmerman, 2001) is a self-administered questionnaire with 125 items which can be applied in just 15 minutes, enabling rapid and effective screening of the psychiatric disorders (Axis I) most commonly found among substance abusers. After linguistic adaptation (translation\/back-translation) and verification of its content validity, the PDSQ was administered to 156 alcohol-dependent patients (DSM-IV criteria; women = 36%), treated consecutively in an alcohol-disorders treatment setting. Its psychometric properties (reliability and validity) were determined, applying the DSM-IV criteria as a \"gold standard\", by means of SCID interview. Using the original cut-off points, the PDSQ showed excellent internal reliability (Alfa = 0.68-0.96) and diagnostic validity, with mean sensitivity = 99.6% (range: 96.6%-100%), specificity = 69.5% (range: 51.9%- 94.6%) and NPV = 99.8% (range: 98.6%-100%). Diagnostic efficiency with the original cut-off points was 73.2%, rising to 91.6% using new cut-off points for certain scales, with a degree of agreement with DSM-IV criteria of Kappa = .303 -. 896. The PDSQ is a reliable and valid instrument for detecting psychiatric comorbidity in alcoholic individuals. Its psychometric properties and the added value of self-administration and short application time make it a recommended instrument for use in routine clinical settings. ","479":"Better coping skills are related to greater capacity for dealing with stressful situations. This relationship could be relevant for the prevention of alcohol-misuse relapse. Relapse rate is higher among severe alcoholics. The current study examines whether this may be due to a lack of coping skills in those cases. The COPE (Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced) is a questionnaire used for assessing coping strategies. COPE scores of 216 alcohol inpatients are compared while controlling for personality disorders (PDs), cognitive impairment (CI) and benzodiazepine misuse (BM). Patients with PDs score higher on the scales of Humor, Venting emotions, Substance use and Use of instrumental support. However, there are no differences in COPE scores attributable to CI or BM. Alcoholics with Personality disorders use maladaptive coping strategies. Patients presenting CI or BM have low capacity for introspection and are unable to properly evaluate their own abilities, so that they tend to give a socially favorable but unrealistic image of themselves. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the predictive validity of the coping skills before training alcoholics, who are especially difficult to assess due to their lower capacity for objective self-observation. ","480":"Marijuana is consistently the most widely used illicit drug among teenagers and most users first experiment it in adolescence. Adolescence is a critical period between childhood and adulthood, including not only reproductive maturation, but also cognitive, emotional and social maturation. In this period adolescent brain is still in transition differing anatomically and neurochemically from the adult's one. The endocannabinoid system is an important determinant for cerebral maturation, therefore its strong stimulation by the delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol, that acts through the endocannabinoid system, might lead to subtle but lasting neurobiological changes that can affect adult brain functions and behaviour. We summarize the more recent researches investigating the relationships between adolescent exposure to cannabinoids and increased risk for psychotic disease such as schizophrenia, as highlighted by both human and animal studies. Epidemiological evidence suggests that cannabis use is a risk factor for schizophrenia, and an exacerbation of symptoms and worsening of the schizophrenic prognosis may occur in individuals with a predisposition for schizophrenia. The characteristic of adolescent brain probably makes it more vulnerable to cannabis effect producing psychotic like symptoms and possibly cause schizophrenia.","481":"","482":"","483":"The association between psychopathology and nicotine dependence in smokers has been a relevant topic in recent years. Nevertheless, little is known about personality disorders in smokers. The aim of this article is to review research published nationally and internationally which analyzes the relation between tobacco use and personality disorders. Our review permits us to affirm that research on the presence of Axis II disorders in smokers is rather scarce. Of 12 studies analyzed, it can be concluded that the prevalence of personality disorders in smokers is highly variable (between 9% and 45%), and that, in the majority of the studies, smoking is associated first with the presence of cluster C disorders (dependent, avoidant and obsessive-compulsive), and second, with cluster B disorders (histrionic, narcissistic, borderline and antisocial). Finally, we note the various limitations of previous studies and stress the need to better understand these disorders, given their relevance to the treatment of smokers.","484":"Party networks of young people are very important for socialization, but can also influence their involvement in risk behaviours or they can be protective. The influence of nightlife network of friends in using alcohol\/ drugs is investigated through a survey. We explore the individual-centred networks (7.360 friends) of 1.363 recreational nightlife users in 9 European cities in 2006, through 22 friend characteristics. Statistical analysis utilised factorial analysis with varimax rotation and analysis of variance. The 69% of the sample had been drunk during the last month and more than half of them had used illicit drugs. Most of the respondents use to have a stable group of friends with whom to go out. Networks main characteristics were being more or less deviant and\/or prosocial. Having not network or a less prosocial network is related to be low consumers. Having a non deviant, but prosocial network is related to being a person who gets drunk without using illegal drugs. Users of illegal drugs have a deviant and prosocial network. Finally ex users have less deviant networks, but at the same time a helper and prosocial network. Males drug use patterns appear to be less affected by the characteristics of their networks. Some preventive consequences coming from these results are already known as the importance of having less deviant friends. But some other issues are less known: to enhance certain prosocial skills may have counter preventive effects among recreational users and to influence the network for preventative purposes may be more effective among females.","485":"There is little information available regarding the course of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a general hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the timing of the most important clinical features attributed to alcohol withdrawal, as well as their prognostic implications. A cohort study of patients with a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome was carried out at the Xeral Hospital in Lugo (Spain) between 1987 and 2003, in accordance with DSM IV-TR criteria. Data on clinical characteristics and course were collected, with special attention to the timing of significant events. A total of 539 episodes were studied in 436 patients: 156 cases of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and 383 of alcohol withdrawal delirium. Mean time of abstinence until the diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome was 54 hours (D.T. = 31.1). Seizures occurred at 35 hours (D.T. = 23.3) after abstinence. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome lasted for 46.4 hours (D.T. = 23.1) after diagnosis. In cases in which delirium tremens developed, this occurred at 46.4 hours (D.T. = 23.1), and lasted 73.9 hours (D.T. = 41.5). Patients needing intensive care were admitted to the ICU 40.8 hours (D.T. = 60) after the diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The clinical features of alcohol withdrawal syndrome tended to be more prolonged in patients admitted with a medical or surgical diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome than in those admitted because of withdrawal syndrome itself. The natural history of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a general hospital setting and the timings of its principal events follow a clearly recognizable pattern. This knowledge can help to provide better assessment in relation to the monitoring and treatment of these patients. ","486":"The HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs) has led to greater support for the development of the harm-reduction perspective. This has proven to be a driving force for initially reluctant policy makers, managers and health care providers and has facilitated the implementation of harm-reduction programmes. This article presents recent data, both global and at the European and Spanish levels, about a) the epidemiological situation of HIV infection among IDUs, and b) the state of development of harm-reduction programmes. The incidence of HIV infection among IDUs not only continues to grow in different areas of, for example, Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe, but has even shown an upturn in cities or specific IDU groups in parts of Western Europe with apparently comprehensive harm-reduction strategies. On the other hand, of the 158 countries that acknowledge illegal drug use via injection in their territory, only 82 support harm reduction, explicitly in national policy documents and\/or through the implementation or tolerance of interventions such as needle exchange programmes or opioid agonist programmes. These data, in conjunction with the high-quality and consistent evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of harm- and risk-reduction programmes for HIV prevention and management among IDUs, should serve as a call to avoid complacency with regard to the diversification, accessibility and coverage of harm- and risk-reduction programmes for IDUs.","487":"The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between substance use (i.e., alcohol and illegal drugs) and dating aggression in couples of adolescents and young adults. The sample comprised 1,282 people of between 15 and 20 years of age. Through cluster analysis, three groups of young people with different levels of substance use were identified: low, intermediate, and high use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Through logistic regression analysis, high levels of alcohol and illegal drug use were revealed to significantly increase the probability of reporting physical and sexual aggression in both sexes. Likewise, young people with high levels of use more frequently reported that they were the ones who initiated episodes of aggression against their partners. The results suggest that alcohol and drug use is a risk factor for dating aggression, a finding that should be taken into account for the prevention of intimate partner violence, beginning in adolescence.","488":"A new measure of positive and negative alcohol expectancies for children aged 8 to 12 years was developed and validated. Study 1: 117 children answered a structured open-format question to provide information regarding the effects of alcohol use that they anticipate. The pool of items obtained was analyzed by a group of three experts according to the following criteria: item correspondence with two different theoretical models and item semantic clarity. Following analysis of the agreement between judges, a set of 55 items was obtained. Study 2: 209 children answered the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire for Children (CEA-N). Internal structure was analyzed through the use of exploratory factor analysis. A principal components analysis with oblimin rotation yielded a five-factor structure. The measure was found to demonstrate good internal consistency for the global and 'risk and aggression' scales, and moderate internal consistency for the remaining four scales: sociability, relaxation, courage and negative mood. These results indicate that the CEA-N is a valid and reliable measure for assessing alcohol expectancies in Argentinean children.","489":"Although a high prevalence of personality disorders has been reported in substance users, the literature on their value for predicting treatment response is controversial. On the other hand, while the predictive validity of personality traits as predictors of response to drug abuse or dependence has been studied, research on the validity of narcissistic personality traits is scarce. To study the predictive value of personality disorders, narcissistic personality traits and self-esteem for predicting treatment response. We assessed 78 patients attended at an addiction treatment unit using personality disorder diagnoses and measures of self-esteem, narcissism and covert (hypersensitive) narcissism. These variables were used in a Cox survival model as predictive variables of time to relapse into drug use. Hypersensitive (covert) narcissism and borderline and passive-aggressive personality disorders were risk factors for relapse into drug use, while open narcissism was a protective factor. Self-esteem did not show predictive validity. Personality disorders characterized by impulsivity-instability and passivity-resentfulness show higher risk of relapse into drug abuse. Personality traits characterized by high sensitivity to humiliation increase the risk of relapse, whereas pride and self-confidence are protective factors. ","490":"Although smoking and depression have been related, little importance is given to the impact of depression on outcomes of smoking cessation interventions in the workplace. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of depressive symptoms and a history of depression on abstinence after a workplace smoking cessation intervention, and to explore the roles of gender, nicotine dependence and antidepressants. A retrospective study with employees of Barcelona City Council participating on a voluntary basis. The intervention consisted of a multicomponent approach combined with pharmacological treatment. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and history of depression was noted in the baseline assessment. Higher scores in BDI were associated with lower rates of abstinence at 3, 6 and 12 months. BDI scores &gt;or= 13 were related to a 1.81x higher likelihood of relapse. This relationship was independent of the effect of dependence severity, of gender and of treatment with antidepressants. In contrast, a history of depression did not influence outcomes. New therapeutic strategies are needed to reduce the impact of employees depressive symptoms in workplace smoking cessation programmes. ","491":"In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.","492":"The Internet and virtual social networks are new technologies that have had most impact on young people and have provided many benefits to their users. However, some people become obsessed with the Internet, are unable to control their use of it, and may put their work and relationships in jeopardy. This paper addresses the issue of the maladaptive use of these technologies. Internet use and abuse are related to psychosocial variables, such as psychological vulnerability, life stress and family and social support. There are some specific risk factors for abuse of virtual social networks among young people. Certain alarm signs appear before a hobby becomes an addiction. The concept of 'Internet addiction' has been proposed as an explanation for uncontrollable and harmful use of this technology. Symptoms of excessive Internet use can be identified with the criteria used to diagnose other chemical or non-chemical addictions. Prevention strategies in both home and school settings should be implemented on the basis of behavioral risk factors and demographic characteristics. The goal of treatment for this type of addiction, unlike the case of other addictions, cannot be total abstinence, but rather controlled use. The psychological treatment of choice appears to be stimulus control and gradual exposure to Internet, followed by a cognitive-behavioral intervention in relapse prevention. There is a need for more information about young Internet abusers and about the most appropriate programs for treating them. More research is required on the enhancement of motivation for treatment and the types of brief intervention available in relation to the problematic use of Internet among young people. The implications of the present review for clinical practice and possible future research directions in this field are discussed, as well as the problems as yet unsolved.","493":"Clinical practice shows that addict patients tend to seek attention from health services after a long period of time, and that their relatives do not seek early medical care, despite knowledge of the addiction. To determine the time elapsed between the beginning of patients' substance use and when they first seek specialized medical care (TC) and the time elapsed between relatives perceiving the substance use and when they first seek specialized medical care (TSAM); also, to identify the factors associated with seeking medical care earlier. Observational, descriptive study. A structured survey, validated by experts in the field of addiction, was applied to 113 family members responsible for patients addicted to psychoactive substances in 5 hospitals in the city of Lima. Patients seek specialist medical care for the first time 11.22 years after commencement of substance use, and family members take to 4.69 years to seek medical care from when they perceive of the substance use. Female gender, the concept of addiction as a disease and not waiting for the patient's decision before seeking medical care reduce TC and TSAM in the case of most substances. Patients addicted to psychoactive substances turn to health services only after long TC and TSAM; moreover, the delay in seeking medical care on the part of relatives means that patients continue to use substances. ","494":"To know the psychometric properties of the GHQ-28 when it is applied to a sample of opiate-dependent patients. Participants were 138 opiate-dependent patients. Reliability was estimated by means of the Cronbach's alpha and Spearman-Brown coefficients. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was applied to check the four-factor structure proposed by Goldberg and Hillier. The sensitivity and specificity of the instrument for the detection of possible psychiatric cases were measured using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, using as criterion the DSMIV diagnosis from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Reliability estimation was adequate. Validity results could not confirm the four-factor structure of GHQ-28 proposed by Goldberg and Hillier. The sensitivity and specificity parameters show optimum values of 60.7 % and 73.7 %, respectively, 65.9 % of the participants being correctly classified. GHQ-28 shows adequate reliability and appropriate sensitivity and specificity parameters when it is applied to opiate-dependent patients. However, the original factorial structure could not be confirmed. Given these results and those from other validity studies in which the relationships with Severity of Dependence, Physical Health and Health-Related Quality of Life were shown, the GHQ-28 can be considered a useful instrument for screening in clinical practice. ","495":"The high rate of dropout from treatment programs is one of the most serious problems in the field of drug dependence. Early identification of predictors of dropout risk can provide useful information on the specific treatment needs of these types of patient. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of premature cessation of an outpatient treatment program for cocaine addicts. The study was carried out at public healthcare units in a Spanish city. Participants were 91 cocaine addicts admitted for treatment for their addiction, assessed by means of interview and various self-report measures. For identifying predictive variables the researchers used a factor analysis, a cluster analysis and a CHAID analysis. The variables that obtained predictive capacity were the MAST scores and the combined alcohol and drugs scores on the EuropASI. These three variables were grouped in a single factor which was called addictive severity. The predictive analysis showed that this factor had some degree of capacity for the prediction of dropout, but that it was not completely determinant. The results suggest the advantage of detecting at the admission stage those patients who might require more attention to their motivational aspects, greater treatment control and intensity, or the provision of complementary interventions.","496":"To analyze the relationship between participation in a drug addiction treatment program and Schwartz's values of Openness to change (Self-direction, Stimulation and Hedonism) and Conservation (Tradition, Conformity and Security) in cocaine users. The present quasi-experimental study was carried out on a sample of 411 adult cocaine users, grouped according to whether they had begun treatment more than three months earlier or less than three months earlier or they were not receiving any treatment. Using Schwartz's Personal Values Questionnaire (PVQ), we measured the priority given by each of these groups to the values of Conservation and Openness to change. Participants who had initiated the treatment more than three months earlier tended to score lower in the values of Openness to change than those who were not in treatment, though there were no significant differences in these values between those who were not in treatment and those who had been in treatment for less than three months. On the other hand, it was observed that participants in treatment, regardless of the time spent in treatment, scored higher in values of Conservation than the cocaine users who were not in treatment. These results reveal the relationship between attendance on a cocaine-dependence treatment program and personal values, together with their potential importance in treatment and rehabilitation programs for cocaine users. ","497":null,"498":"Narcissistic personality is an important component of personality disorders which are prevalent in those presenting drug abuse or dependence. Assessment instruments usually consider self-esteem, narcissism and covert narcissism, but although Spanish versions of instruments for self-esteem and narcissism are available, there is no available test for covert narcissism. OBJECTIVE. To test the validity of the Spanish version of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in individuals presenting drug abuse or dependence. In a sample of 79 outpatients, we assessed reliability by means of Cronbach's alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), construct validity through factor analysis, and concurrent validity by means of the correlation between the HSNS and measures of severity, disability, self-esteem, grandiose narcissism and personality disorders. Reliability of the HSNS total scale score was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha = 0,73, ICC = 0,67), though some items would require further consideration. Factor analysis showed good construct validity with three factors compatible with the theory of covert narcissism. With regard to concurrent validity, covert narcissism (HSNS) correlated positively with open narcissism, severity and disability due to drug use, and negatively with self-esteem. Highest scores on the HSNS corresponded to borderline, narcissistic and passive-aggressive personality disorders. The Spanish version of the HSNS could be a valid instrument for the assessment of covert narcissism in those treated for drug abuse or dependence. ","499":"Ephedra is an amphetamine-like compound with a potent sympathomimetic effect. Ephedrine, its active component, is widely used for weight loss, to enhance athletic performance or as component of some drugs. Its cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, increased inotropy, arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension, and these are the effects for which it is used therapeutically. However, it can also cause adverse effects, such as neuropathy, myopathy, psychosis, addiction, stroke, insomnia, myocarditis, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction or sudden death. We present the case of a patient, with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, who developed congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema in the context of severe biventricular dysfunction and myocardial necrosis secondary to longstanding ephedrine abuse. Secondary causes of dilated myocardiopathy such as alcohol abuse, autoimmunity, hemochromatosis, thyroid alterations, viral or bacterial myocarditis and coronary heart disease, were ruled out. Five years after total cessation of use of the drug containing ephedrine, the patient is symptom-free, with partial recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction.","500":"It is important to assess the interaction between family psychopathologic history (FH), family dynamics (FD), behavior disorders, substance-use disorders and personality disorders (PD). Cross-sectional design. The sample was made up of 350 subjects with substance-use disorders who were assessed for FH including alcoholism and substance-use disorders through an interview; for substance use via a questionnaire; for FD; for PD using the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE); for behavior problems in adolescence; and for disocial disorder. Correlated variables were included in logistic regression models. Early age of onset for substance use is related to FH of substance use disorders and poorer FD. FH of alcoholism, substance-use disorders and psychiatric disorders are related to poorer FD. Early age of onset for substance use, FH and a disruptive FD are related to behavior problems and disocial disorder. Early age of onset for substance use, FH, disruptive FD, behavior problems and disocial disorder are related to presence of PD. Logistic regression predicted the presence of PD by age of onset for use of methadone (CI(95):1.005\/3.222; p=0.048) and of other opiates (CI(95):0.864\/0.992;p=0.028). FH score in alcoholism predicted Borderline Personality Disorder (CI(95):1.137- 2.942; p=0.013), and age of onset of cocaine use predicted Antisocial Personality Disorder (CI(95):0.864\/0.992; p=0.028). FH of substance use and own use predict the presence of some PDs. ","501":"Prevention programs and interventions in the field of drug abuse are designed to reduce the incidence of onset of substance use, but they can also produce harms. This is the reason why rigorous evaluations are absolutely needed. In Europe, in spite of the large spread of such interventions, they are rarely evaluated with rigorous study designs. For these reasons it is important to promote the evaluation of every program that can be considered of relevance. This would allow the other practitioners to choose the interventions on the base of evidence of effectiveness. But which kind of evaluation prevention programs needed? There is a substantial agreement on the role of the randomized evaluation. Randomization is the only effective way to control for numerous factors that can bias the results. The typical evaluation design associated to most part of intervention programs, the pre-post assessment, cannot produce unbiased estimations. There are however many interventions that cannot be randomised, because they cannot be provided at the individual level (e.g like the price policies for cigarettes). These programs require an observational approach for evaluation, like a cohort or an Interrupted Time Series design. Even if these study designs have a complex methodology, the evaluation is of high relevance in order to allow the development of prevention strategies based on evidence.","502":"The chronobiological aspects of addiction constitute a recently developed field of study that has obtained interesting data from both basic and clinical research. Drug consumption has a negative effect on the expression of circadian rhythmicity, since it produces a flattening of the functions and a delay of maximal values, and can even cause a state of desynchronization of endogenous control. Moreover, it has been shown that the clock-genes Clock and Per2 are associated with vulnerability to addiction, the first gene directly regulating dopaminergic activity in the reward system and the second participating in the sensitivity to and abstinence from drugs. The evening circadian typology has also been proposed as an individual difference to be taken into account as a risk factor in the development of drug addiction. Finally, the reorganization of circadian rhythmicity with regular daily schedules adjusted to the cycle of light-darkness, exposure to natural or artificial light, and the administration of melatonin may be useful strategies in the treatment of drug addictions.","503":"Participating in nightlife it is a meaningful cultural activity for young people. Councils welcome a flourishing late-night entertainment industry. But there also problems related to the people involved (alcohol and drug abuse, violence, risky sex...) and to the recreational activity itself (noise, street drinking, vandalism...). Prevention intervention possibilities are numerous, and most have been implemented, however assessment of their outcomes is less common. We have identified 11 types of prevention according to their main objective (venues centred, community, education, law enforcement, industry collaboration...) and we have reviewed the existing evidence in relation to each form of intervention. Popular types of interventions as providing information or pill testing are not evidence based. Other interventions as Responsible beverage services or designated driver programmes, backed by the industry, are not exactly the most effective, especially if they are not enforced. Others like community approaches can be effective but it can be a problem how to achieve their continuity. From the present review, what emerges as the best strategy is the combination of training, cooperation and enforcement. 'Classical' measures (taxation, reduced BAC limits, minimum legal purchasing age...) are also evidence-based and effective. Could be interesting to investigate interventions that address the cultural aspects of nightlife. But this sort of interventions do not depend on the will or the skills of professionals, and are more related to societal changes. The highly frequent use of popular but ineffective interventions contributes more to the problem than to its solution, and only facilitates giving preventive efforts a bad reputation.","504":"Early Club Studies emphasised the inclusiveness of club cultures and the PLUR ethos of 'peace, love, unity and respect' alongside a polarised characterisation of nightlife contexts, as either commercial, alcohol-oriented nightclubs offering 'mainstream' pop music, or 'authentic'\/'alternative' underground dance clubs associated with widespread illicit drug use. This paper adds to the growing body of research problematising these simplistic characterisations of club cultures and leisure venues across the night-time economy, emphasising elements of fragmentation and segregation alongside the continued importance of social structure and resultant social and spatial exclusion. The authors explore how informal processes - such as club launches, internet promotions and dress codes - together result in the production and reproduction of two contrasting forms of English clubland elites: 'cultural elites' produced through the social, cultural and spatial exclusion of electronic dance music of black origin and its minority ethnic, working class and lower income followers from Manchester city centre dance clubs; and 'consumer elites' produced through the economic and cultural exclusion of working class and lower income club-goers from nightclubs in London's West End. The complex and interweaving practices of cultural distinction and structural discrimination which produce such elites are often closely intertwined with the formal and informal regulation, marginalization and criminalization of specific cultural forms. The paper therefore argues for the construction of more nuanced conceptual understandings of the social divisions and inequalities within nightlife and in studies of young people's leisure opportunities more generally.","505":"There has been a significant incursion of prescription drugs in to the club scene worldwide. The concomitant use of ecstasy and pharmaceutical drugs is associated with potentially serious health-related harms. This has ramifications for people who deliberately combine pharmaceutical drugs with ecstasy to achieve a specific effect and for people legitimately using pharmaceutical drugs for a health condition who may incidentally use ecstasy. This exploratory study had the broad aim to investigate the patterns and harms of concomitant use of pharmaceutical drugs and ecstasy, and to explore participants' experiences when visiting a General Practitioner (GP). In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 ecstasy\/pharmaceutical drug users. Users reported deliberately combining stimulants (dexamphetamine, methylphenidate (e.g. Ritalin), antidepressants and sildenafil (e.g. Viagra) for non-medical purposes with ecstasy. A wide range of effects were reported. Several clear relationships emerged between the use of pharmaceutical drugs and ecstasy, and the distinctions between these in terms of motivations for use and consequences are discussed. The attitudes of GPs were professional and non-judgemental and there was little reluctance among participants to disclose illicit drug use. Screening for illicit drug use was limited. Findings have important implications for clubbers in regard to harm reduction strategies and highlight a number of areas for future research. ","506":"This paper explores how music and music genre can govern the nightlife experience, specifically how a nightclub's music policy can impact on clientele, health behaviours, bar sales and levels of disorder. Participant observations were conducted in sample of eight city centre nightclubs in Glasgow, Scotland. Music policy was found to influence nightclubs' clientele and their behaviours, for example in relation to differences in levels of alcohol or illegal drug use, sexual activity and violence between venues. Further, within individual venues, music policy was also observed operating as a crowd control tool, with for example such entertainment being used in alcohol marketing, in 'soft policing' and in the temporal management of patrons' movements. This research acknowledges the centrality of the DJ in implementing these controls. It is clear that music is a central component of the Nighttime Economy. Despite this, to date music has tended to play 'second fiddle' to sex and drugs within Club Health research. From this research it is recommended that music policy be incorporated into responsible bar server training packages. ","507":"Night recreational settings have become a key location for the socialisation of young people. For customers attending these places, the consumption of alcohol and drugs is related to changes in sexual decision making and associated with increased likelihood of engagement in more risky sexual behaviours. To identify the characteristics of Portuguese young people who attend nightclubs, pubs and bars; to explore relationships between attendance at these settings and the consumption of alcohol and drugs; to study associations between substance use and sexual behaviour. Respondent-driven sampling methodology was used in nine Portuguese cities to survey 1142 young people who attend nightlife leisure locations. Respondents regularly go out at night, especially at weekends. The most used substances are alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy. Alcohol and drugs users have more regular and deeply-rooted night recreation habits than nonusers and drugs consumption increases with increased recreational activities. In the last 12 months, 83.3% of the respondents have already had sexual intercourse (X= 2.0 partner; SD = 2.3), 51.0% had sex under the influence of alcohol, 22.9% under the influence of drugs and 46.7% agreed that this influence made them have unsafe sex. Early alcohol and drug use was proportionately related to an early sexual experience. Alcohol and drugs use s were more likely to adopt more sexual risk behaviours than non-users. The enjoyment of recreational nightlife settings exposes Portuguese clubbers to environmental factors which, in combination with substance use, may influence the nature of relationships between alcohol and drug use and sexual behaviour. ","508":"Research on clubbing spans numerous fields and adopts diverse approaches to the populations in question. Yet, a somewhat homogenous narrative has emerged about clubbers and substance use, one that focuses on overconsumption, risky behavior, and considerable consequence. The purpose of our study is to unpack this narrative by exploring how the substance use patterns of clubbing populations differ by individual and scene-level factors. From this, we hope to increase an understanding of how social and cultural factors impact the relationship between clubbers and substance use. We draw on direct observation of 29 club events and interviews with 51 respondents from the hip hop (HH) and electronic dance music (EDM) scenes in Philadelphia to inform our research objective. Analyses revealed two broad criteria on which a substance use-based typology of clubbers can be offered: motivations for clubbing and level and type of scene involvement. From these two dimensions, we are able to distinguish among three types of clubbers: drug sub-cultural members, commercial clubbers, and music connoisseurs. Drug sub-cultural members reported early onset of drug use and a greater frequency of current drug use at largely underground EDM club events and outside them as well. Commercial clubbers had benign histories with drugs, but they reported attending mostly commercialized HH events to get drunk and court the opposite sex. Music connoisseurs reported minimal current drug and alcohol use at exclusively underground EDM and HH club events, following from, in some cases, extensive histories with drugs and alcohol. The differences between these three groups' substance use patterns, we contend, can be attributed to the interplay between numerous social and cultural factors not previously considered.","509":"The present study is an evaluation of a designated driver intervention. The objectives were: (1) to verify the intervention assumption, which is that offering incentives, linked to a positive result of the breathalyser test (&lt;0.5 g\/l) when leaving the club, leads to a decrease in the percentage of drivers leaving the club with a BAC above the legal limit; (2) to understand the reason why drivers take part in the intervention and assess whether the operation was effective in lowering the amount of alcohol consumed during the night; (3) to verify the assumption that there is a bias in the selection of designated drivers. Pre-experimental research design with a control group and no pre-test. The two conditions of the independent variable were: presence or absence of the \"Safe Driver\" intervention. A group of drivers who took part in the intervention (DDs N=124) was compared with a group that did not (non-DDs N=139). (1) DDs' mean BAC was significantly lower than non-DDs', but (2) the incentive motivated just 5% of DDs to drink less, and (3) there is a bias in the selection of DDs that present a lower drinking risk profile than non-DDs. The effectiveness of the intervention doesn't seem to be supported by strong evidence. The free-entrance incentive is not effective in motivating drivers to drink less. More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of designated driver interventions where the bias in the selection of drivers has been removed, by, for example, using other incentives and to have a clear understanding of designated drivers' risk profile. ","510":"Substance use, risky sexual behaviour and violence are among the key youth health issues today. Whilst they are the focus of much prevention work in the UK, relatively little information is available to inform prevention in international holiday resorts, where young people can take the greatest risks with their health. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1033 British holidaymakers aged 16-35 in Ibiza and Majorca airports (Spain). Surveys covered frequency of alcohol and drug use at home and abroad, and drunkenness, sexual activity and experience of a range of negative experiences on holiday. Illicit drug use was more common in Ibiza. Over half (53.9%) of visitors to Ibiza reported using at least one drug on holiday (compared with 13.9% in Majorca) and over a third reported using more than one drug. However visitors to Majorca reported more frequent drunkenness and more negative outcomes (arguments, fighting, unintentional injury, illness and requiring medical attention). In both locations, frequency of substance use increased on holiday. A quarter of those travelling without a partner reported having had sex during their holiday, and of these a third did not consistently use condoms. Frequent drunkenness was associated with fighting, unintentional injury and sex with a new partner. Illicit drug use, particularly polydrug use, was associated with fighting and unprotected sex. Young holidaymakers face significant health risks on holiday. Understanding which resorts are associated with which types of health risk behaviour is critical in targeting health promotion and harm reduction measures appropriately. ","511":"This editorial presents the views of the guest editors of this collection in summarising some of the general themes arising from a selection of papers presented at the 2008 Club Health Conference in Ibiza, Spain. Particular emphasis is placed upon the value of comparative approaches to club studies, youth culture and substance use so that researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners can gain new understanding of the interplay of local and global factors which shape club cultures, nightlife scenes, and individual lifestyles. By contextualizing the studies in this volume, the editorial outlines important themes and issues which will help promote Club Studies as an interdisciplinary field of endeavour well into the future.","512":"Drug consumption constitutes a public health problem in Mexico. In the international literature and from the health promotion perspective, the Life Skills Approach proposed by the World Health Organization identifies the ability to resist pressure as a key component in the prevention of legal and illegal drug use among adolescents. An instrument for measuring this ability was developed and validated in order to confirm whether, as the empirical evidence suggests, it differs between users and non-users of alcohol and tobacco. The sample was made up of 5651 adolescents, 2637 (47.9%) of whom were male and 2864 (52.1%) female. These participants were selected at random from among public high school pupils in Mexico City, and average age was 16.7 years. The instrument used was that validated in the first phase of the study. To measure patterns of use, we used a scale based on indicators derived from the National Addiction Survey (2002). Factor analysis yielded three factors: peer pressure acceptance, partner pressure acceptance and peer\/partner pressure resistance. Non-users of alcohol and tobacco scored higher in the ability to resist pressure than those who had used alcohol and tobacco in the last month. Based on these results, the aim is to develop an addiction prevention program for public high school pupils in Mexico City. ","513":"The incidence of the abuse of illicit drugs in sport may be a useful indicator of the extent of the phenomenon among the youth population. Many drugs of abuse are included in the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Prohibited List, and are therefore routinely tested for in antidoping controls. This study presents the data obtained in tests carried out in the period 2003- 2007 at the Antidoping Laboratory of Rome, on 44781 samples analysed. The methods used are those developed by the Laboratory for routine antidoping analyses. The percentage of positive test results ranges from 1.1 to 2%, with a high incidence of stimulants and drugs of abuse. The substance most frequently found is THC metabolite, which accounts for 0.2-0.4% of the total, followed by cocaine metabolites, accounting for 0.1%. Other stimulants found are ephedrines, carphedon, modafinil, and anorexic compounds such as phendimetrazine and norfenfluramine. No amphetamines or amphetaminelike designer drugs have been detected. These data may be indicative of the widespread incidence of cocaine and cannabis abuse among the young Italian population, bearing in mind that the phenomenon is underestimated in this study, due to the fact that drugs of abuse are investigated only in samples involved in competitive sport, and especially to the fact that people doing such activities take more care of their health and are subject to greater control in their behaviour and habits with respect to the 'normal' population.","514":"The pronounced fluctuations in cardiovascular mortality in the countries of the former Soviet Union over the past decades have attracted considerable interest. The mounting evidence suggests that binge drinking pattern is a potentially important contributor to higher cardiovascular mortality rate in the former Soviet republics. There is assumption that if occasional heavy drinking of strong spirits increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality, countries where this is predominant drinking pattern should display positive association between spirits consumption and cardiovascular mortality at the aggregate level. To estimate the aggregate level beverage specific effect of alcohol sale on myocardial infarction mortality rate in drinking culture, which combine a higher level of spirits consumption per capita with the explosive drinking pattern. Trends in beverage specific alcohol sale per capita and myocardial infarction mortality rate from 1970 to 2005 in Belarus were analyzed employing ARIMA time series analysis. The results of time series analysis suggest positive relation between strong spirits (vodka) sale per capita and myocardial infarction mortality rate. The analysis suggests that a 1 liter increase in vodka sale per capita would result in a 7.2% increase in myocardial infarction mortality rate (8.2% increase in male mortality and 6.8% increase in female mortality). the results of the present study suggest a positive relation between vodka sale and myocardial infarction mortality rate at aggregate level and support the hypothesis that binge drinking of strong spirits is a risk factor of myocardial infarction at the individual level. Thus, from a public policy point of view, the outcome of this study suggests that cardiovascularrelated mortality prevention programs should put more focus on addressing alcohol consumption structure. ","515":"It is well known that there is a lack of psychometric studies testing sexual function in drug-dependent population. Thus, the main objective of this work was to carry out the first psychometric analysis of the Brief Sexual Functioning Inventory (BSFI) in a sample of drug users (N = 104). Participants filled out the BSFI, Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14) and Addictive Behavior Questionnaire (ABQ). The BSFI shows a five-factor structure similar to the original (Sexual drive, alpha = .75; Satisfaction, alpha = .63; Erectile function, alpha = .70; Ejaculatory function, alpha = .74; and Problem Assessment, alpha = .70), though compared to the original scale two items are loading in a different dimension. The high and significant correlations with the CSFQ-14 indicated adequate validity of the measures. Capacity of the BSFI to discriminate between clinical and non-clinical samples is discussed.","516":"Experimentation with alcohol constitutes a problem on the increase among young people in recent years, and mean age at first consumption has fallen. The goal of the present work was to carry out an exploratory study of attitudes toward alcohol use in terms of three dimensions (cognitive, affective and behavioural) in a sample of 755 secondary school pupils from the Principality of Asturias (Spain). Subsequently, we selected a sample of 141 adolescents described as at risk in view of their more permissive attitudes in relation to their lower age level (mean= 14.24 years), with the aim of applying a socio-educational preventive programme that included follow-up assessments at two, seven and twelve months. The results showed the preventive efficacy of the didactic activities programmed, a strengthening of attitudes contrary to experimentation with alcohol, and greater resistance to peer pressure, as well as the modification of patterns and frequency of use. Of the four programs applied (Family Intervention, Expert, Information, and Basic Sensitization), we found greater preventive efficacy for the competence-enhancement and psychosocial intervention programs, compared to the merely informational type.","517":"Alcohol advertising correlates with consumption, particularly in young people. We studied the evolution of the amounts spent on alcoholic beverages advertising and on advertising as a whole in conventional media in Spain during the period 1995-2005. We analyzed the amounts spent on advertising in total and on alcoholic beverages advertising by studying the annual INFOADEX Survey on Advertising Investment in Spain in conventional media (TV, radio, the press, billboards and Internet). The results were subdivided into the periods 1995-2000 and 2001-2005. In the period 1995-2000 there was an increase (Delta) in alcoholic beverages advertising expenditure, from 268 to 347 million euro (Delta=29.5%), but a decrease in its percentage of advertising as a whole (from 7.6% to 6.1%). In the period 2001-2005 there was a rise in alcohol advertising expenditure from 145 to 186 million euro(Delta=28.0%), and also in its percentage of total advertising (from 2.7% to 2.8%). In 2001-2005, spending by Regional governments on preventive advertising increased from 22 to 52 million euro (Delta=136%). Alcohol advertising expenditure remains high in Spain, with young people as a primary target. In contrast, there is only modest investment in preventive advertising. Regulatory measures are necessary with a view to protecting populations especially susceptible to uncontrolled consumption. ","518":"To assess the metric properties of the abridged, 10-item version of the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire-Now (CCQ-N-10) in its Spanish adaptation. The sample consists of 63 people beginning treatment for cocaine-abuse (n=23) or dependence (n=40) disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed an assessment battery that included the extended, 45-item version of the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ-N-45) - in which the CCQ-N-10 is embedded -, the Cocaine Craving Scale (CCS), a Visual Analog Craving Scale (VAS), the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), and the Clinical Psychiatric Impression (CPI). Cronbach's values for the CCQ-N-10, CCQ-N-45, SDS and CCS scales were 0.95, 0.88, 0.79 and 0.93, respectively, indicating that all instruments show high internal consistency. Test-retest reliability for the CCQ-N-10 was fair (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient=0.59; p&lt;0.001). A factor analysis of the CCQ-N-10 (KMO=0.85) shows a one-factor structure explaining 68.6% of the variance, with factor loadings ranging from 0.64 to 0.92. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the unidimensionality of the scale (CF =0.91; SRMR=0.06). The CCQ-N-10 explains 86.6% of the variance accounted for by the CCQ-N extended version (CCQ-N-45) and shows convergent validity with related measures such as the CCS (r=0.64, p&lt;0.001), VAS (r=0.65, p&lt;0.001), SDS (r=0.53, p&lt;0.001) and CPI (r=0.50, p&lt;0.001). Persons fulfilling criteria for cocaine-dependence disorder, compared to those who present cocaine abuse, show higher CCQ-N-10 scores (F(1;60.6)=7.16, p=0.010). The Spanish adaptation of the CCQ-N-10 shows metric adequacy, and can be considered as a suitable assessment instrument in relation to cocaineuse disorders. ","519":"To explore empirically the presence of certain To explore empirically the presence of certain factors as risk elements for cocaine consumption. Analysis of the data obtained in a set of items that measure the variables of the Planned Behavior Theory (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention) in three groups: Group A is made up of 192 cocaine users without treatment, Group B comprises 110 cocaine users in treatment, and Group C is made up of 100 individuals who had never used cocaine. Group A scored significantly higher in all the variables, while Group C was which obtained the lowest scores. Group B showed no significant differences from Group A in the subjective norm variable, nor from Group C in the perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention variables. This study highlights the importance of attitudes and subjective norm in the explanation of current cocaine use, but especially the function of perceived behavioral control as a risk factor that should be taken into account in the design of preventive strategies. ","520":"Some smokable herbal mixtures under the brand name Spice drugs have been sold on the Internet and in specialised shops (smart shops) since 2004. The mixtures are advertised as an exotic incense blend which releases a rich aroma and not for human consumption. When smoked, Spice drugs products have been reported by products have been reported by some users to have effects similar to those of cannabis. Spice drugs have received intensive attention in drug forums due to the possibility to obtain a non legal substitute of cannabis. Forensic analyses have found different potent synthetic cannabinoid agonists in some Spice drugs products, as JWH-018, CP 47497, JWH-073 and HU-210. There are few data about its pharmacological properties in animals, but nothing about its toxicity. At present, almost nothing is known about the pharmacology, toxicology and safety profile of such compounds in humans, except the opinions of consumers in internet forums. Neither the herbal ingredients of Spice drugs, nor any of the synthetic cannabinoids found in them, are internationally controlled under the 1961 or 1971 UN drug control conventions. Some European countries have recently taken legal actions to ban or otherwise control Spice drugs products and related compounds. These cannabinoid substances can be considered as new products to be added to the list of 'designer drugs'.","521":"Dual diagnosis requires complex therapeutic approaches to adapt treatment to the dual nature of the problem. It is important to understand the drug effects and the drug interactions that may be observed during the integral treatment of these pathologies. Given the scarcity of data on the effects of lithium and methadone treatment, the aim of this clinical case report is to explain the interactions produced between methadone and lithium carbonate, in a female patient with medical multi-pathology, opioid-dependent and with comorbid bipolar disorder, who was treated with both drugs. The most common adverse effects for each drug are described. Drug interactions and temporal correspondence of the two drugs, as well as their dosages, are described through review of the retrospective chart and prospective follow-up of the patient. After one year of follow-up the patient had experienced no interactions in the concomitant lithium and methadone treatment. It should be noted that treatment of bipolar patients with dual diagnosis is complex, and should only be carried out by experts.","522":"Several studies have shown evidence of executive function impairment associated with substance abuse. This suggests the potential usefulness of a baseline assessment measure to screen for dysexecutive impairments in individuals beginning treatment. The Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) is a test widely used to estimate executive dysfunction. The main objective of this work is to study the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX-Sp). A complementary goal is to study its potential utility for initial screening in addicted individuals seeking treatment. A sample of 131 non-clinical and 127 clinical individuals meeting the DSM-IV-TR substance abuse or dependence criteria were recruited. Internal consistency of the questionnaire was assessed (Cronbach's Alfa=0.91), as well as other reliability indicators. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis offers four- and five-factor solutions. Also tested were the dimensionality and structural model and its convergent and discriminant validity with other instruments. Differences between clinical and non-clinical individuals and total scores were also analyzed. The data suggest that the Spanish version of the DEX is a useful measure for assessing general symptoms of dysexecutive syndrome, and a valid, reliable and adequate screening test for estimating cognitive impairment associated with substance abuse. ","523":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of gender, alcohol use, smoking behaviour and the practice of sport on physical self-concept among Spanish students of physical education. A total of 1,008 students (M age=15.94, SD=89) participated in the study, and completed the physical self-concept questionnaire (PSQ). The results revealed that physical self-concept was related to gender, alcohol use, smoking behaviour and the practice of sport. The best perception of body image was found in women who did not smoke and participants (male and female) who did not do sport. On the other hand, being male and practicing sport predicted general physical self-concept. This study shows the relevance of the belief that smoking is associated with good body image and that sport is practiced to improve physical appearance.","524":"Benzodiazepines (BZ) are widely prescribed drugs, but their use is controversial in patients who present a disorder caused by substance use\/abuse, due to the risk of tolerance and abuse\/dependence. The purpose of this work is to determine the levels of BZ use in patients treated with methadone and to compare them with findings from the current literature. a sample of 43 patients was selected; inclusion criterion was being on the PTDO (treatment program with opiate derivatives) at the UAD (Drug-dependence unit) in Monforte de Lemos (Lugo-Spain). Demographic and use variables were analyzed. Data collection and subsequent analysis were carried out using the statistical program SPSS 12.0. 46.5% of the patients take BZ, and of these, 60% are over age 45. The most widely used of these is alprazolam (p&lt;0.001), and 70% take just one active ingredient. The main prescriber is the general practitioner, and the most frequent indication is insomnia. BZ-use data and their relationship to time spent on methadone are similar to those of other published studies. Despite the recommendation to use long half-life BZ in patients with substance abuse disorders, it is striking that in the case studied here the most widely prescribed type is alprazolam. ","525":"The aim of this study was to develop an exploratory approach to characterizing the pattern of recreational abuse of alcohol and other drugs abuse at Christmas work dinners. An adaptation of the rapid assessment methodology RARE was carried out through the combination of quantitative (rapid assessment surveys, n=444) and qualitative (observations and semistructured interviews, n=8) techniques. The fieldwork was carried out at 13 restaurants in Valencia and Alicante (Spain) in December 2007. In general we observed a marked increase in the use of alcohol and other substances compared to the rest of the year, though restaurant staff perceived a decrease in alcohol abuse attributable to new road traffic legislation. Cocaine is perceived as the illicit substance most widely used at such events. Younger coworkers initiate older ones in the use of illicit drugs, and the the latter may use this behaviour as a means of feeling younger and more uninhibited. Christmas work dinners propitiate a recreational substance-use pattern that requires adapted preventive and restrictive interventions, such as the introduction of suitable transport initiatives and the restriction of alcohol serving hours.","526":"This study analyses the neuropsychological profile of a sample of cocaine addicts and compares it with a control group from the same social environment. Also, it explores the predictive power of some neuropsychological tests on treatment outcome six months after the exploration. We administered a neuropsychological battery to 30 patients with a diagnosis of cocaine abuse or cocaine dependence, and to 30 control participants with no history of drug abuse from the same social environment. Verbal learning (p&lt;0.001), immediate visual memory (p&lt;0.05), attentional resources management (p&lt;0.05), phonologic fluency (p&lt;0.01), abstraction (p&lt;0.001), complex problem-solving (p&lt;0.05) and mental flexibility (p&lt;0.05) are the functions most affected by cocaine use. The alterations found in the addict participants were small and non-pathognomonic, though the deficits can be correlated with impact on quality of life and on everyday occupational performance. The neuropsychological exploration showed a certain predictive capacity of abstinence after 6 months (the addict participants with better verbal mnesic performance and greater mental flexibility at the beginning of the treatment seem to benefit more from this). Finally, the results suggest that addicts live in a cognitively poor social environment. It is suggested that drug use increases previous deficits, probably of an educational or environmental origin, that are common to their immediate social context. ","527":"To evaluate th e impact of a training intervention To evaluate the impact of a training intervention for health care professionals on inpatients' smoking and alcohol consumption and to compare the hospital intervention for the two substances. Through two parallel studies, we compared, using auto-administered questionnaires, the referred clinical behaviour on smoking of 66 health care professionals and the intervention received by 169 patients, with the clinical behaviour on hazardous drinking of other 38 professionals and other 118 patients from different hospital wards before and after attending a training in brief intervention on smoking cessation and hazardous alcohol drinking respectively. We only found slight differences between alcohol and tobacco concerning professionals' behaviour. Professionals declared to assist more often patients with alcohol risk consumption than smoking (36.4% vs 10.9% [p&lt;.0001]) although with patients those differences haven't been confirmed. They just told to have been asked more often about alcohol consumption than about smoking (43.6% vs 30.8% [p&lt;.05]). There were no differences after the training sessions. Before and after training, health professionals hardly intervene in patients with alcohol or tobacco consumption even we observed higher detection and assist for alcohol risk consumption. It is necessary to examine other barriers to the application of the knowledge gained. ","528":"The purpose of this study is to analyze to efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral treatment program, in individual and group format, for people with alcohol problems, and to determine the role of some personality variables in the process of therapeutic recovery. The sample was made up of 80 patients diagnosed as alcoholics, 83.8% of whom were men (n=67) and 16.3% were women (n=13). Mean age was 42.73 years, with a standard deviation of 9.63 years. Basically, we found a high incidence of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and consumption patterns that change as a function of the presence or absence of personality disorders. We also observed that the results varied in relation to physiological variables and environmental situations associated with the presence of craving responses. Treatment of such patients with dual pathology demands greater effort from the therapist to promote treatment adherence, an aspect crucial to completion of treatment programs and to achieve therapeutic success. Cognitive-behavioral intervention for relapse prevention was observed to produce satisfactory results in patients with personality disorders. Neither consumption patterns nor personality disorders predict the type of treatment termination.","529":"The aging or senescence process that follows maturation is characterized by time-related functional decline due to genetic, biochemical, physiological and anatomical degeneration in tissues and organ systems with time. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the heart and brain is inversely related to maximum life span of mammals, suggesting that accumulation of mtDNA damage is involved in the various disorders associated with aging, cancer and neurodegeneration. The suppression of stem\/progenitor cell proliferation also contributes to the aging process, by reducing tissue regeneration and repair and ultimately reducing longevity. Another important factor is the intracellular deposition of lipofuscin granules (age pigment), a non-degradable polymeric material accumulated within lysosomes, which ultimately exacerbate oxidative stress levels in senescent cells. Drugs of abuse can strongly contribute to these senescence accelerating factors in the brain. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('ecstasy') and methamphetamine were shown to promote deletions in brain mtDNA. Concerning stem\/progenitor cells, it has been shown that several opiates and psychostimulants, including ecstasy, decrease the self-renewal capacity of the hippocampus by diminishing the rate of proliferation of neural progenitors and\/or by impairing the long-term survival of neural precursors. Chronic alcohol consumption induces lipofuscin deposition in neurons and heart cells. These facts provide interesting hints on the potential of these drugs in accelerating brain senescence. While the extent and severity of the contribution of drugs of abuse for accelerated senescence remain uncertain, these putative aging effects add up to the dark side of drug addiction and undoubtedly require a strong research effort in the near future.","530":"Transitions in drug abuse (going from one substance to another and from one form of administration to another) has been scarcely studied in Latin America. In this project 96 people in treatment, aged 14 to 50, were interviewed in seven Colombian cities. Five kinds of transition were identified: general, cumulative, substitutive, reverse and negative, occurring at nine different points; 113 transitional patterns (combinations of two substances) were found, 23 common to men and women, 10 exclusive to women and 80 exclusive to men. Contrary to all expectations, 21 cases of heroin users appeared in this sample, mainly among upper- and middle-class users, more in men than in women, and in very young people: 11 out of 21 were under 20 years of age. The 10 main transitions only involve four substances: marihuana, cocaine, inhalants and tranquillizers, and are most common amongst those under age 23. The youngest use marihuana, cocaine, tranquillizers, glues, ecstasy, poppers and heroin; the eldest prefer cocaine, basuco and marihuana. Mixtures, changes of substance and changes of from of administration are always associated with a search for more powerful effects. Many youngsters believe that marihuana is either harmless or beneficial, because it can cure cancer caused by smoking tobacco. Heroin is considered the most dangerous drug because of its bad effects on all levels. The main limitations of this study were: the small number of participants, the even smaller number of women, and the fact that only people in treatment were interviewed.","531":null,"532":"This paper explores the personality disorders most commonly related to cocaine addiction. The samples used were 60 cocaine-addicted patients, who were assessed with the MCMI-II before treatment, and 50 normative participants from the general population with the same demographic features (age, sex and socioeconomic level). According to the results, 36.7% of the clinical sample (versus 16% of the normative sample) showed at least one personality disorder. The most prevalent disorders in the cocaine sample were Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder (10% in each case), followed by Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder and Histrionic Personality Disorder (6.7% each). Moreover, 15% of the clinical sample showed more than one personality disorder. Finally, the implications of this study for clinical practice and future research in this field are discussed.","533":"The aim of this study was to assess the association between stress, cognitive schemas, impulsivity, and substance use in adolescents. A sample of 657 adolescents (367 girls and 290 boys) completed measures of stressful life events, cognitive schemas of grandiosity and insufficient self-control, impulsive style of problem-solving and substance use. The results indicated that stressful life events and the cognitive schemas were significantly associated with substance use. In addition, the impulsive style of problem-solving moderated the relationship between stressors and substance use, this association being stronger among more impulsive adolescents. Finally, the results indicated that boys scored higher on Grandiosity and on the use of marijuana, cocaine, LSD and ecstasy, while girls scored higher on tobacco use (smoking). Despite these differences, gender did not moderate the association between schemas and substance use.","534":"Several studies have indicated that certain aspects of schools may influence parents decision to participate in preventive interventions related to the health of their children. 1) To study the relationship between parental rating of calls for participation sent from the school and family risk factors. 2) To study differences in parents attendance and drop-out for a family-based drug-use prevention programme according to their rating of the calls for participation sent out by the school. 339 families of children aged 12-14 from 3 state (public) secondary schools in the region of Asturias (Spain). It is noteworthy that parents with higher educational level present better parenting practices, and therefore, fewer risk factors in relation to drug use in their children. Furthermore, the presence of fewer risk factors correlated with the items related to attendance and calls for participation and the interest shown in such calls, indicating that the children least likely to use drugs are those whose parents are most actively involved in their education. As regards the effect of the calls for participation on programme attendance and drop-out, we found that parents who attended several sessions have had previous and satisfactory experience of some kind of preventive intervention, and receive with great interest the calls for participation from the school. ","535":"To know the underlying dimensional structure of personality disorders in the MCMI-II through factor analysis. A sample of 749 patients who start a treatment by substance abuse or dependence, according to DSM-IV criteria, compliment the MCMI-II, once free of the direct influences (intoxication, withdrawal) of abuse drugs. Their answers in the MCMI-II were studied, through first and second order factorial analysis. An initial factorial solution of 46 components is obtained. The first of them refers to changes experienced in last years, explaining 25.51% of the variance. A second order factor analysis groups the former factors in 7 components. The first of them reunites symptoms of Axis I around the components of change in two last years and in the last months and weeks (14.17% of the total variance). The other components reflect those dimensions usually found in some other factor studies of personality. Results show that a wide proportion of the variance in the MCMI-II is better explained by recent changes than stable traits and their extreme combinations. As these results are obtained in substance addict population, it is suggested part of which the MCMI-II measures can be referred to changes in personality. These changes may be associated to inadequate answers to stressful environmental factors. They can be also associated to changes in brain functions due to direct or indirect influences of substances on brain locations. ","536":"To analyze several factors and attitudes related to drug use among first-year Spanish university students, with special reference to tobacco. Descriptive study using voluntary and anonymous questionnaire. sex, age, family environment, tobacco, cannabis and alcohol use, attitudes in favour of or against smoking, perceived danger of drugs and perceptions of friends behaviour. 2445 students, 1014 (42%) men and 1431 (58%) women, mean age 19 years. Women in this study see smoking as appealing, believe it helps them stay slim and claim that it makes them feel good. Of the total sample (men and women), 16.5% use cannabis daily, occasionally or at weekends, while 10.4% state that their friends have tried or use other drugs. In this sample women and men have different perceptions about tobacco. Level of tolerance and permissiveness with regard to alcohol contributes to the fact that young people perceive less risk in relation smoking. Starting smoking tobacco early may make the use of alcohol and other drugs more likely. ","537":"Relapse Prevention (RP) is the central and most original focus in the treatment of addictions. Several studies support the effectiveness of group therapy in RP. To compare group psychotherapy for RP with standard follow-up of alcohol-abuse\/ dependence patients. Fourteen patients were assigned to the relapse prevention group and another ten patients received the standard outpatient monitoring. Numbers of relapses during the group therapy and one year later were recorded. We found statistically significant differences (CHI(2)=7.95) p=0.019 between the two groups for rates of abstinence and relapse at the twelve-month follow-up. Group Therapy for Relapse Prevention is effective, easy to apply in the outpatient context and obtains better rates of abstinence than standard outpatient treatment at the one-year follow-up. ","538":"Binge Drinking (BD) pattern is firmly established among adolescents and young people. This pattern has raised a strong concern within the neuroscience community due to its possible impact on specific brain regions still maturing. Research with animal models demonstrates that BD may have serious structural and functional effects during these ages. Some regions like the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus and the cognitive processes in which these structures play a role seem to be specific targets of alcohol. Results provided by the scarce studies carried out in humans support the evidence from previous animal experiments. However, we are far from being able to answer if this pattern of consumption has a special effect in the adolescent brain and what the short and long-term consequences are. Common limitations in human studies include the insufficient control of powerful confounding factors, the use of designs that does not allow differentiation between markers and effects, the use of reduced samples and the lack of replication studies. Although the innocuousness hypothesis is no longer sustained and experimental evidence has accumulated showing the risk associated with BD, results have been somewhat overinterpretated. The valuable contributions of cross-sectional designs should be complemented by the contributions of prospective longitudinal studies with appropriated sample sizes and a higher control of critical variables in order to identify short and long-term structural and neurocognitive consequences.","539":"Professionals treating persons with addictions must work with the individual characteristics of each case. However, collective aspects shape consumption at the population level and also the personal frequency of exposure which influences the development of dependence. Among factors influencing consumption, some may be modified by regulations or public policies. Most important are those related to substance availability, social acceptability of use, promotion, price, and treatment availability. This editorial discusses actors favouring and opposing the adoption of preventive policies, the contexts in which they are discussed, and the potential role of professionals and their organisations.","540":"The burden of alcohol-related problems in central and eastern Europe is the highest in the world. The level of alcohol consumption in Belarus is among the highest in the world, with an annual consumption rate estimated to be 14 litres of pure alcohol per capita. The social, economic and political turmoil that Belarus has experiences in the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union has been accompanied by a substantial rise in all-cause mortality. Although alcohol seems to be an important contributor to the burden of disease in the former Soviet republics, little systematic research has been undertaken on its impact on all-cause mortality in Belarus. The aim of the present study was to address this particular deficit concerning the alcohol-total mortality relationship in Belarus by using aggregate-level data. Trends in the all-cause mortality and alcohol psychoses incidence rates (as a proxy for alcohol consumption) from 1970 to 2005 were analyzed employing ARIMA time series analysis in order to asses bivariate relationship between the two time series. The results of time series analysis suggest a close relationship between all-cause mortality and alcohol psychoses rates at the aggregate level. This study replicates the previous findings that suggested close link between alcohol and mortality. The outcome of present study also supports the hypothesis that alcohol is a crucial factor of mortality crisis in Belarus. Therefore, alcohol control must be a key priority for Belorussian public health policy. ","541":"Tobacco use among girls is increasing at an accelerating pace, with adverse effects for their own health and that of their potential offspring. In order to test, through structural equation modeling techniques, an explanatory model of smoking intention in young girls, we applied a validated instrument to 386 female students at state and private secondary schools. The model considered the effect of six protective and risk factors on smoking intention, as well as the relationship between them. These variables were obtained from a multiple regression analysis which included a total of 25. The results indicated that having friends who smoke cigarettes constitutes the main influence on smoking intention in young girls. Parents play a fundamental protective role, since, on supervising their daughters activities and prohibiting smoking at home, the girls smoking intention is decreased, presence of friends who smoke is controlled, and rebellious behavior is moderated, and this influences the girls beliefs about the benefits of smoking. Believing that tobacco is really addictive is also a protective cognitive factor for such girls. Proposals are discussed for applying the findings to prevention programs addressing smoking in young girls, and in which parents are included.","542":"Alcohol dependence is a chronic disease whose treatment begins with detoxification, followed by rehabilitation. We present a descriptive and retrospective study of 147 patients admitted to our unit during the period 2003-2005. Median age was 46.07 years, with 77.6% men and 22.4% women. Admission diagnosis was alcohol withdrawal syndrome in 31 patients (21.1%) and programmed alcohol detoxification in 116 patients (78.9%). On the CIWA-Ar scale: mild withdrawal, 100 patients (68.5%), moderate, 35 patients (24%), severe, 11 patients (7.5%). Mild group showed a statistically significantly lower proportion of hepatopathy, by comparison with the moderate and severe groups. Statistically significant differences were found between the mild and severe groups on comparing mean age, duration of stay, quantity of alcohol and parameters of chronic consumption (ferritine, fe, VCM, UBE, AST, bilirubin and Mg) for AST and bilirubin. There were 11 seizures: 4 patients from the programmed group, with mild withdrawal on the CIWA-Ar scale, and 7 patients with moderate-severe withdrawal. No relationship was found between patients intensity of withdrawal syndrome, age or sex. There was higher intensity on the CIWA-Ar score (moderate and severe) among patients who had already begun withdrawal syndrome, compared to those admitted on a planned detoxification programme. The CIWA-Ar is a useful tool for assessing withdrawal symptoms and risks of complication and for planning treatment. Clinical practice must provide patients with access to health resources for the appropriate treatment of their addiction, with standardized assistance during their stay in hospital.","543":"Irresistible compulsion to use, or craving, is one of the key symptoms of substance dependence syndrome, and of major relevance with regard to relapse in the abuse of alcohol or other drugs. In the present paper, the relationship between attention, attentional processes and the craving phenomenon is reviewed. The paper also explores the different elements of attention, and particularly the relevance of selective attention in craving and the initial stages of relapse. Those psychological strategies that have emerged as effective in the management of craving for substances are also reviewed, with particular emphasis on the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse and on relapse-prevention therapy. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of so-called attentional therapy, based on mindfulness, and its potential effectiveness in the management of addictive disorders in general and of craving in particular.","544":"Recent years have seen an increase in drunkenness among young people who go out at weekends, but there is limited information on the relationship between sexuality and drunkenness in these contexts. Here we analyze, in a sample of 440 people aged 14 to 25 who frequent nightlife recreational contexts, who have had sexual relationships and who use some type of drug or alcohol, the reasons for not initiating a sexual liason, as a function of drunkenness and gender. The sampling method used was respondent-driven sampling. The results show that 63.3% admit that under the effects of alcohol or other drugs they have failed to take precautions in their sexual relations, the proportion of women not taking precautions being higher than that of men. The results referring to the reasons for not initiating a sexual liason are similar across genders and states of drunkenness. The only difference found is that women are more likely to reject sex when the prospective partner is inappropriate. A logistic regression analysis indicates that drunkenness is the most important variable in explaining the different sexual behaviors. We conclude that drunkenness is related to the failure to take precautions in sexual relations, the results being similar in men and women.","545":"The evolution of people in treatment for cocaine dependence at public Drug Abuse Centers is a relevant topic in view of the notable increase in demand for such treatment in recent years. The aim of the present study was to analyze the evolution of people with cocaine dependence receiving treatment at public Drug Abuse Centers in Galicia (NW Spain), two years after the initial assessment for inclusion on the treatment program. The sample for the present study was 38 participants who formed part of a larger initial sample (N = 115). The variables analyzed were: substance use, social adjustment on the O.T.I. scale, problems with the legal system and perceived psychological distress as assessed with the scales and indices of the SCL-90 R. The results indicate that, after two years of treatment, 78.9% of those in the sample located (26% of the initial sample) had not consumed cocaine in the month prior to assessment, and that there was a reduction in psychological distress. These results indicate a positive evolution after two years of the sample of people in treatment for cocaine dependence assessed in this study.","546":null,"547":"To study the psychometric properties of the VAL-89 questionnaire and its possible use in addict individuals who ask for treatment. Analysis of the psychometric properties of the questionnaire and its factorial structure, applying it to 792 individuals. 365 of them were substance users seeking treatment and 427 were general population. Reliability of the questionnaire is confirmed, although its factorial structure appears to be different from the original. In our study appear 12 factors, instead of the original 10. These factors are named: Power, Stimulation, Submission, Tradition, Spirituality, Self-Sufficience, Hedonism, Sociability, Universality, Convencionalism, Idealism and Self-Realization. These factors are distributed through several dimensions represented by four axis: individual-social, dominance-equality, tradition-pleasure and great values-anomie. The VAL-89 questionnaire seems to be a useful tool to explore which are the more appreciated social values, being of special interest to know which are specially selected by addict individuals. ","548":"This paper deals with the new development of controlled gambling embedded in a harm-reduction context as a viable solution both for primary prevention at school and for treatment of some kinds of problematic gamblers. Pathological gambling significantly improves with psychological therapies, such as stimulus control and in vivo exposure with response prevention or cognitive interventions. In some cases psychopharmacological therapy may complement the benefits of treatment for pathological gambling when patients have comorbid depression or high impulsivity. However, in this mental disorder the goal of treatment (total abstinence or controlled gambling) is currently a controversial issue. Controlled gambling may be a therapeutic option for young gamblers or patients without severe dependence. Furthermore, controlled gambling may be a relevant issue for health education in schools, with a view to teaching teenagers how to cope with actual and virtual exposure to gambling. Likewise, the gambling industry and governments are involved in harm minimization initiatives. Thus, it is necessary to coordinate a program of research that includes the industry, science, and public representatives, based on cooperative research that will permit the introduction of controlled gambling within a global strategic framework. We discuss the relevance of this review for clinical practice and for future research, as well as the unsolved problems in this field.","549":"The term 'dual diagnosis' refers to the co-occurrence of at least one substance use disorder with another psychiatric disorder in the same individual. These 'dual' patients or patients with psychiatric comorbidity are common, and present greater severity from both the clinical and social perspectives than those subjects with only one type of disorder (addictive or other psychiatric illness). We present the current situation regarding dual diagnosis from epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic perspectives and we review the most important challenges for the future. Among the challenges for the future, we highlight: the need to improve the understanding of the nosological characterisation of the co-occurrence of psychopathological symptoms and the use, intoxication and withdrawal from substances; the need for clinical screening instruments to detect dual diagnosis; the need to develop effective therapeutic strategies both pharmacological and psychological; the importance of providing integrated care to these patients by one therapeutic team within a single mental health and addiction network; and finally, the need to incorporate training on dual diagnosis for health professionals.","550":"Objective: This article explores differences in personality traits between subjects with substance addiction in treatment and subjects from the general population matched in the variables sex, age and educational level. Material and method: Consecutive sampling was used to obtain a sample of participants undergoing treatment for addictive disorders at a public centre (CAD 4). A sample of the general population was obtained by means of the snowball technique. Only pairs (one participant from each sample) with the same age, sex and educational level were considered. In this way, 55 pairs were obtained. Cloninger's TCI-R was used and the global results were compared, crossing all variables. Results: Significant and consistent differences were found in just two traits: Novelty-Seeking, greater in addicts, and Self- Directedness, greater in general population. Conclusions: Data strongly suggest that observed differences are not previous, but consecutive to the addiction, it being apparent that the effects of the substances and the psychosocial conditions associated with their consumption are what exacerbates or blocks development of the traits. Findings are related to studies linking these variables with neuropsychological functions, and the inclusion of this neuropsychological perspective is strongly proposed for application to the assessment and treatment of addictive disorders.","551":"Directly Observed Treatment (TOD-DOT) has been tested in different conditions. The objective of this work is to check whether a UCA-CAB (Centre for Addictive Behaviour) can achieve detox and reduce the risk of early relapse (up to 12 weeks) in alcoholic patients. All patients had an established organic addiction and serious withdrawal syndrome, and had undergone multiple previous treatments. Furthermore, they had not managed to abstain for a 3-month consecutive period over the previous 2 years. The aim of the Directly Observed Treatment was to attain detox and reduce relapse by following a multi-method approach: medical, psychological and personal care, based on a brief daily consultation and pharmacological supervision. The results were as follows: Of the 18 patients included in the study, after 12 weeks, 13 (72 %) were still abstinent and 4 (22 %) had relapsed. Thus, 17 (94 %) were still following the treatment, with just one drop-out. We analysed the profiles of the patients abstaining, of those who relapsed (4) and of the one who dropped out. The average CIWA-Ar was 27.05 (21-36). Any value over 20 is considered to indicate serious withdrawal syndrome, though there were no negative events leading to hospitalization. Level of adherence to the treatment (94 %) meant that the most seriously affected patients and those with fewest financial resources could benefit, not only from any auxiliary social schemes, but also from basic health services, permitting them to improve the quality of their everyday life.","552":"The assessment of quality of life has become one of the priority indicators of outcomes in the field of clinical research. Therefore, it is necessary to use instruments adapted to and validated for the context in which they are to be used. To assess the psychometric properties of the IDUQoL (Injection Drug User Quality of Life Scale) in its Spanish adaptation. Participants were 100 persons with a diagnosis of opiate addiction who were on a methadone maintenance programme. They responded to the IDUQoL -in its 21-domain version- and two other quality of life instruments (the SF-36 and the EQ-5D). Good reliability data are obtained (Cronbach's alpha of 0.92 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for the test-retest of 0.79). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and semi-partial correlations analysis confirm the unidimensionality of the construct, with explained variance of 43.8% and adequate fit indices (GFI = 0.92; CFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.044). Convergent and criterion-related validity were also quite adequate (correlation coefficients with the SF-36 and EQ-5D were situated between 0.34 and 0.61, and with other criterion variables between 0.23 and 0.39; p &lt;0.05), even though the discriminant validity analysis is not completely conclusive. The findings from this study provide evidence to support the use of the IDUQoL as a specific quality of life instrument in the addictive disorders context, and confirm its appropriate characteristics in the Spanish adaptation. ","553":"High alcohol consumption by young people at weekends is a public health problem of considerable social and family importance. Chronic alcohol intake causes structural changes in the central nervous system, though the effects are not uniform throughout the brain. The prefrontal cortex (PC) has been reported to be one of the regions most sensitive to prolonged alcohol ingestion. The effects of chronic ethanol exposure have been extensively studied. Our aim is to identify the neuropsychological deficits in PC function induced by intermittent heavy alcohol drinking in young adults. Neuropsychological assessment was carried out on participants to examine their performance in PC-dependent tasks. 62 subjects (mean age 18.82+\/-1.099) were assigned to one of three categories: 1) Those reporting heavy binge drinking of alcohol at weekends (ALE); 2) Those reporting moderate binge drinking of alcohol at weekends (ALM); and 3) Those reporting no alcohol intake (CTR). The findings indicate that intermittent alcohol binge drinking, either heavy or moderate, in young people results in poorer performance in neuropsychological tasks such as Digits, Corsi or Stroop, which depend on correct PC functioning. Our results support the claim that the binge pattern of exposure to ethanol leads to neurocognitive and neurobehavioural impairment equivalent, in many respects, to that found in chronic drinkers. Moreover, intermittent heavy alcohol drinking in adolescence and early adulthood increases the risks of lifetime alcohol dependence and other psychopathologies. ","554":"To assess the efficacy of oxcarbazepine in the treatment of cocaine addiction and its influence on impulsivity and craving in cocaine addicts. A prospective, observational and clinical study was conducted in patients diagnosed with cocaine abuse\/dependence (DSM IV criteria), monitoring supervised treatment with oxcarbazepine for 12 weeks. 30 patients (aged 18 or over) voluntarily undergoing treatment at an Addictive Behaviors Unit (UCA). Patients were selected randomly after providing explicit authorization and informed consent. Abstinence rate increased, reaching 100% of participants that remained in compliance throughout the 12-week period (60% of those who started the treatment). Negative results in the urine test for cocaine detection also increased, reaching 90.9% of those in treatment at week 8. Treatment with oxcarbazepine was seen to produce a statistically significant reduction in craving and impulsivity after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, with respect to baseline measures at the start of treatment. The craving index correlates with reduction in cocaine use. Oxcarbazepine is effective in reducing impulsivity and craving in relation to cocaine. Thus, we recommend high initial doses of oxcarbazepine in patients with high impulsivity prior to treatment. ","555":"The increase in opiate addicts in treatment with methadone, coupled with improved survival of HIV patients, has meant an increase in the demand for detoxification from this substance in our environment. It is common practice in hospital detoxification units to request a maximum dose of methadone (around 40 mg) on beginning detoxification treatment. However this is not always possible, due to the time needed for a gradual decrease for outpatients making daily visits to the methadone dispensing centres, due to the appearance of withdrawal symptoms, or because the patient starts out from very high doses of methadone. Reported here is an experience with 22 inpatients who over the last two years underwent detoxification from methadone without requesting from their treatment centres a maximum-limit dose at the start of their treatment. During the detoxification they are given treatment with clonidine and benzodiazepines (dosage being adjusted according to concomitant use of alcohol, benzodiazepines and cocaine) and non-opiate-based painkillers. On the seventh day they are given 50 mg of naltrexone. Of these addicts, 21 completed the detoxification adequately.","556":"To analyze social behaviours of alcoholic and cocaine-dependent women. Six alcoholic women and six cocaine-dependent women in outpatient treatment made up the study sample. The technique used was that of life history interview. Data analysis was carried out based on Grounded Theory. Alcoholic women become dependent through progressive consumption, while cocaine-dependent women begin cocaine use as consequence of a particular event or incident; cocaine use among these women is also related to pleasure-seeking and to drug-dependent partners. There is a social stigma in drug-dependent women--more evident in alcoholics--related to non-fulfillment of tasks and roles that society imposes on women. The illness concept also appears more often in the discourse of alcoholic women than in that of cocaine addicts. As regards the family, it has a double meaning for these women: on the one hand, it is the first context to suffer the consequences of their drug abuse, through lies, petty theft and verbal aggression; on the other, the family is an important source of support in the initiation and process of treatment. Drug abuse has specific social repercussions that should be taken into account in the establishment of appropriate help mechanisms. ","557":"Several observational follow-up studies about cardiovascular health have found an overlap between moderate drinking and lower mortality from coronary heart disease and other causes. However, such studies have serious methodological limitations. Most non-drinkers were in fact ex-drinkers, that is, people who had had to stop drinking for health reasons. Other variables that may play a decisive role in cardiovascular risk, such as tobacco smoking, exercise and body mass index, were not evaluated, and changes in drinking habits were not assessed periodically. Due to the methodological limitations of these studies, the findings suggest a statistical association but not a causality relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and lower risk of mortality. Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that excessive drinking can cause not only cardiovascular diseases--such as hypertension, arrhythmias, dilated cardiomyopathy and stroke--but also other medical and psychiatric disorders. Alcohol clearly has addictive properties that can contribute to the development of heavy drinking in some people, leading to alcohol-related physical and mental disorders. The public health message should emphasize the potential risk of heavy drinking rather than promote the possible benefits of moderate consumption. A simplistic message that alcohol is good for cardiovascular health may be prejudicial when stated outside the context of the possible adverse consequences of heavy drinking.","558":"There is growing evidence of extensive damage from alcohol to chronic disease, trauma, social problems and high economic costs. In a number of countries there has been an increase in consumption and\/or high risk drinking in recent years. However, it appears that in many context alcohol management is not yet of high priority. Canada has experienced several developments in recent years: a gradual increase in overall consumption, an increase in high risk drinking, more extensive marketing and promotion of alcoholic beverages, and easier access to alcohol. Survey data for Canada, and for Ontario, the most populous province, indicate that the proportion drinking 5+ per occasion has increased since the mid-1990s. Overall, alcohol-related harm has been conservatively estimated to contribute to $14 billion to social costs using 2002 Canadian data. There are a national and several provincial-level alcohol strategies designed to reducing alcohol-related problems, but they are at the proposal, not full-scale implementation, stage. In order to generate effective, efficient and decisive action and reduce overall harm, several recommendations are highlighted: an increase in alcohol pricing\/taxation, a ceiling on further access via controls on outlet density and hours of sale, a rejuvenation of the control functions of liquor boards, and the resources to effectively implementation these measures.","559":"","560":"The objective of the present research is to assess perception of and levels of satisfaction with the Lugar de Escucha program, as well as its brief interventions using counseling and motivational sessions. The study is of a pre-experimental type, with a single-group pretest-posttest measurement design. The sample was made up of 128 participants (9.4% females and 90.6% males), aged 15 to 51 (mean= 23.65; standard deviation = 7.92), users of cannabis, cocaine base paste, cocaine, inhalants and alcohol who attended the program. Data collection was carried out using Attention Forms (FdA); the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA); the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (CST); and the Cases Follow-up Survey (ESC). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Lugar de Escucha Program, we assessed participants' motivational phases during the first interview and at referral, their level of satisfaction with the service received and the percentage of entrance to different treatment programs of the referred participants. The results on perception and satisfaction confirm a predominance of the program's strengths. With regard to the motivational phases, the findings show that the motivational induction interventions help to establish and maintain the patient's motivation for attitude change and for cessation of the abuse. In this sense, according to the findings, such interventions tend to be more effective when applied to patients in the Precontemplational and Contemplational phases. This suggests the need to work with more homogeneous groups, considering type of drugs, age and gender, and to use pre and post instruments. Likewise, the results suggest the need to classify patients in phases of change; such classification could be a useful tool for the improvement of treatment programs for drug users.","561":"There is increasing evidence to suggest that the cannabinoid system is a crucial mechanism in the regulation of feeding and metabolism. It is against this background that a cannabinoid antagonist, rimonabant, is about to come onto the market for the treatment of obesity. Moreover, in addition to weight-loss effect, this drug has a beneficial effect on the so-called metabolic syndrome, with changes in the lipid and glucidic metabolism not observed for other anti-obesity drugs currently available. We present a review of current knowledge in this field and data from our own studies: genetic studies of this system in eating disorders and in obesity and studies of localization of cannabinoid receptors at sites related to feeding. These studies support a state of cannabinoid hyperactivity in obesity; furthermore, such hyperactivity can constitute a prognostic factor.","562":"The paper introduces a variant of chain-referral sampling: respondent-driven sampling (RDS). This sampling method shows that methods based on network analysis can be combined with the statistical validity of standard probability sampling methods. In this sense, RDS appears to be a mathematical improvement of snowball sampling oriented to the study of hidden populations. However, we try to prove its validity with populations that are not within a sampling frame but can nonetheless be contacted without difficulty. The basics of RDS are explained through our research on young people (aged 14 to 25) who go clubbing, consume alcohol and other drugs, and have sex. Fieldwork was carried out between May and July 2007 in three Spanish regions: Baleares, Galicia and Comunidad Valenciana. The presentation of the study shows the utility of this type of sampling when the population is accessible but there is a difficulty deriving from the lack of a sampling frame. However, the sample obtained is not a random representative one in statistical terms of the target population. It must be acknowledged that the final sample is representative of a 'pseudo-population' that approximates to the target population but is not identical to it.","563":"The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) generate new styles of meeting people or connecting with friends or strangers. In this context, the internet and the mobile phone deserve special attention. This article deals with the maladaptive use of these technologies. By reviewing the literature published between 1991 and 2005 and indexed in the databases of PsycINFO, Medline, Psicodoc, IME, and ISOC, we aim to determine whether maladaptive use of these technologies can be considered a mental disorder, and if so, of which type. We describe the psychological phenomena of maladaptive use of the internet and mobile phones, we review research on prevalence and possible risk groups, and finally we discuss some of the criticisms made with regard to the existence and classification of this disorder. It is concluded that excessive use of the internet can lead to a mental disorder of the addictive type, which can particularly affect individuals with special emotional needs, as well as adolescents and young adults. Among specific applications of the internet, a major risk is found for the use of communicative and synchronic applications, such as chats and online role games, since they permit hyperpersonal communication, playing with different identities, and projections and dissociation without consequences in real life. Furthermore, the internet can play an important role in the development and maintenance of other addictions, such as pathological gambling and sex addiction. In contrast to the case of the internet, maladaptive use of mobile phones may be considered abuse, but not addiction, since their use does not lead to the rapid emotional changes or the playing with identities that can take place in chats and online role games.","564":"To find differential personality traits, through the TCI questionnaire, between alcoholic patients who abuse benzodiazepines (BZD) and those who do not, and between patients affected by personality disorders (PD) and those not affected. These traits can then be used as criteria of good prognosis and as psychotherapeutic targets. Cross-sectional study of 218 alcoholic inpatients, comparing TCI scores between BZD abusers and non-abusers, and between PD-affected patients and non-PD-affected patients. BZD-abusing patients score higher in Harm Avoidance and lower in Self-Directedness than non-abusers. Patients with PD score higher in Novelty-Seeking and lower in Cooperativeness than patients without PD. BZD-abusing patients are less mature and self-sufficient, more impressionable, insecure, and have a high tendency to avoid risk. Patients with PD are more impulsive and less cooperative. The characteristics found with TCI are coherent with the difficulties of these patients during treatment and with clinical impressions. These problematic areas should become therapeutic targets to be modified through treatment. For all of these reasons the TCI emerges as a useful instrument for understanding, assessing and identifying alcoholic patients and their treatment needs. ","565":"To adapt a questionnaire for assessing the use and abuse of Internet, as well as the relationship between this resource and psychosocial profile in a group of university students. 391 students filled out the questionnaires; 26.1% were men and 73.9% were women, with a mean age of 19.59 years (DT = +\/- 2.83; Range: 18-47 years). We used a sociodemographic questionnaire, Social skills questionnaire (Caballo, 1993, EMES-C and EMES-M), Personality questionnaire (E.P.I., Eysenck and Eysenck, 1982), and an Internet and Use and Abuse of Internet questionnaire (adapted from Bruner, 1997, Suler, 1996 and Young, 1996a, Garcia del Castillo y Terol, 2007). 73.91 % of students connect for an average of 84.81 minutes (DT = +\/- 2.05) per week. Except for one subscale of the Internet use and abuse questionnaire, all the subscales showed reliability coefficients &gt; or = . 70 and mean scores lower than the average of the score range. Internet use and abuse showed a relationship with psychosocial variables such as cognitive social skills (r =.14; p =.016) and neuroticism (r =.-13, p =.01). ","566":"The promotion of smoking cessation in hospital settings is uncommon. One of the main barriers to such promotion is lack of knowledge on how to proceed. The objective of this study is to assess changes in professionals' knowledge, attitudes and actions after having received training in brief intervention. Self-perceived knowledge, actions and status in relation to smoking status were assessed in 66 healthcare professionals before and after training. Furthermore, we compared the actions carried out by these professionals with 170 inpatients before the professionals' training and with another 170 after the training (patient's report), to corroborate professionals' self-reported actions. Brief intervention training significantly increased professionals' knowledge of psychological skills (by 23.3%) and of pharmacological resources (by 27.1%). Nevertheless, changes were not observed in the extent to which professionals: ask (30.8% vs. 38.2%, before and after the training, respectively); register patients' smoking status (73.4% vs. 65.9%); assess willingness to quit (25% vs 12.5%); or advise patients to quit (21.9% vs. 20.8%), according to the information provided by patients, which is consistent with that provided by the professionals. It is necessary to examine other barriers to the application of the knowledge gained. ","567":"In a phenomenon as complex as drug dependence there is no doubt that affective and emotional aspects are involved. However, there has been little research to date on these emotional aspects, especially in specific relation to everyday affective stimuli, unrelated to drug use. In this work we investigate whether the consumption of narcotic substances causes changes in the emotional response to powerful unconditional natural stimuli, such as those of a sexual nature. To this end, I.A.P.S. images with explicit erotic content were shown to 84 drug-dependent males, in separate groups according to preferred substance. These groups' results were compared with each other and with the values obtained by non-consumers. The results indicate that drug abusers respond differently to visual stimuli with erotic content compared to non-consumers, and that there are also differences in response among consumers according to preferred substance.","568":"Immunotherapies in the form of vaccines (active immunization) or monoclonal antibodies (passive immunization) appear safe and a promising treatment approaches for some substance-related disorders. The mechanism of action of the antibody therapy is by preventing the rapid entry of drugs of abuse into the central nervous system. In theory, immunotherapies could have several clinical applications. Monoclonal antibodies may be useful to treat drug overdoses and prevent the neurotoxic effects of drugs by blocking the access of drugs to the brain. Vaccines may help to prevent the development of addiction, initiate drug abstinence in those already addicted to drugs, or prevent drug use relapse by reducing the pharmacological effects and rewarding properties of the drugs of abuse on the brain. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies has been investigated for cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine, and phencyclidine (PCP). Active immunization with vaccines has been studied for cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and nicotine. These immunotherapies seem promising therapeutic tools and are at different stages in their development before they can be approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of substance-related disorders. The purpose of this article is to review the current immunotherapy approaches with emphasis on the risks and benefits for the treatment of these disorders.","569":"The addictions are common chronic psychiatric diseases which represent a serious worldwide public-health problem. They have a high prevalence and negative effects at individual, family and societal level, with a high sanitary cost. Epidemiological genetic research has revealed that addictions are moderately to highly heritable. Also the investigation has evidenced that environmental and genetic factors contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to addictions. Advances in the neurobiology of addiction joined to the development of new molecular genetic technologies, have led to the identification of a variety of underlying genes and pathways in addiction process, leading to the description of common molecular mechanisms in substance and behaviour dependencies. Identifying gene-environment interactions is a crucial issue in future research. Other major goal in genetic research is the identification of new therapeutic targets for treatment and prevention.","570":"The positive and negative representations of ecstasy were studied in a sample of 223 young people who consumed ecstasy in the city of Coimbra, recruited using the snowball technique. With regard to negative representations they highlight the harmful effects on the brain, with regard to positive effects they highlight the pleasure associated with dancing. The consumers acknowledge the negative representations but consider the positive representations much more important. Rating of the positive representations does not vary according to frequency of consumption, number of pills consumed or whether or not they are polyconsumers. However, those with more negative representations show less abusive consumption patterns. Implications for prevention are discussed.","571":"Male patients in a therapeutic community (n=102) from a city in southern Brazil, with a primary diagnosis of cocaine dependence, were evaluated with Exner's Comprehensive System for the Rorschach, with the objective of describing personality psychopathology. High lambdas were present in 62% of patients. 60.8% of the patients scored positive in the Coping Deficit Index; 22.5% in the Depression Index. Other constellations were infrequently present (&lt;5%). A positive CDI, a measure of difficulty in the management of complexities and poor social skills, may have treatment-matching implications, such as the selection of interventions targeted at interpersonal difficulties. Personality assessment should be considered in such patients. ","572":"There is considerable variation in individual vulnerability to addiction that may be related to personality factors. One of the most widely studied personality traits in relation to susceptibility to addiction has been novelty or sensation-seeking. In the present review we mainly analyze basic research data on the relationship between addiction and novelty-seeking. In animal models, this trait has been assessed mainly by means of motor activity in an inescapable novel environment. Thus, two typologies of rats have been established, the so-called LR (low-responders) and the HR (high-responders), which respectively show low and high levels of activity in a novel environment. HR animals are more sensitive to the motor-stimulating effects of various drugs, and show greater behavioural sensitization with repeated drug administration, than LR animals. Moreover, HR subjects initially acquire operant self-administration behaviour more easily than LR subjects. Hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis reactivity in certain stressful situations is also greater in HR than in LR subjects. At the level of the central nervous system, HR subjects also show greater activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. With regard to dopaminergic systems, microdialysis studies show that cocaine has a greater neurochemical effect (more increase in dopamine levels) in HR than in LR animals. Human data are generally in agreement with those from the animal literature, though there are also contradictory results in both humans and animals, suggesting that this topic is complex and still far from being fully understood.","573":"This study compared the recovery process of two groups of alcohol abusers in Spain, one that had recovered with treatment and one that had recovered without treatment. Using advertisements and other recruitment strategies, 32 Spanish participants (16 treatment-seekers and 16 self-changers) were recruited, all of whom had had problems with alcohol consumption and had recovered 1 year or more previously. Participants were interviewed on a single occasion about their alcohol use history and recovery. Results showed that the two groups differed significantly in variables such as degree of dependence, type of recovery, and coping strategies used in the maintenance of recovery. As in previous research, pressure and support from the person's family and social circle played an important role in recovery and maintenance, especially for the treatment-seekers. These results are highly similar to those found in studies with English-speaking populations.","574":"Many people associate the use of alcohol and other drugs with sexuality. It is common to find that each drug is associated with a specific effect on sexuality. Weekend recreational nightlife settings are increasingly important places for the young, and frequented by them more and more in search of sex and drug-taking opportunities. In this research we are interested in the role the young attribute to recreational drugs with regard to their sexual practices. We interviewed a sample of 100 young people from four Spanish cities, using a questionnaire with both open and closed questions. Snowball sampling was used to find those who had had sexual experience, who had taken recreational drugs and who liked going to discos, bars, etc. at the weekend. We found that these young people have a very precise idea of how each drug functions within sexuality. Considering all four parameters analysed, alcohol is by far the most popular (to initiate the sexual encounter, for more unusual or the \"hottest\" experiences, to increase arousal, and to prolong sex), though in the last case in particular the preferred drug was cocaine. Cannabis does not interest them because of its relaxing effects, while ecstasy is chosen more for remaining active and enjoying oneself than for its sexual effects. Women use alcohol more than men (mainly to increase arousal, when they want unusual sex or to prolong sex) and use cocaine less.","575":"The main objective of this study was to analyze emotional response to a set of everyday emotional visual stimuli unrelated to drug use. Two groups of prescribed opiate drug abusers (heroin+methadone vs. methadone-only groups) currently participating in the Andalusian Experimental Prescribed Drug Program (Programa Experimental de Prescripcion de Estupefacientes de Andalucia, PEPSA) were studied, and comparisons made between them, within them for different phases, and between them and a normative group of nonusers. For this purpose we used the I.C.E.R.E., an instrument based on the I.A.P.S. (International Affective Picture System) and on Peter Lang's S.A.M. (Self-Assessment Manikin). The results showed patterns of emotional response in the opiate users, compared to the non-users, characterized by a lower rating of the everyday natural stimuli of a pleasant nature and a greater sensitivity to the stimuli of a neutral and negative nature. These patterns were quite stable even in different clinical situations and stages of development of the P.E.P.S.A.","576":"The measurement of perception and satisfaction with opiate substitute treatment programmes has concentrated mainly on evaluating the properties of the service offered at treatment centres. Beyond the health-care context, these programmes need to become part of the patient's personal and social life for them to be followed. The purpose of this work is to offer a theoretical frame of reference for the construction of a scale for integral measurement of patient perception of opiate substitute treatments. A sample of 18 outpatient and residential patients in a buprenorphine pilot study, transferred from a methadone treatment programme, who showed indications of abandoning treatment, was given a semi-structured interview. The data analysis was done based on the Grounded Theory, and the dimensions were coded and material triangulated by three specialized analysts. The results show that patient perception of treatment with substitutes is aligned in five main dimensions, value to health, adaptation to daily life, stigma, treatment withdrawal and perceived effectiveness. These results are discussed and compared to those found in specialised literature.","577":"According to the European Drug and Drug Addiction Observatory, after Cannabis, Cocaine is the most widely used illegal drug in Europe. Awareness of the damage caused by consuming this substance is clear in some areas, while in others it may be ignored, underestimated or poorly dimensioned. The information systems that do exist almost certainly underestimate the number of deaths connected with cocaine. Apart from the potential the drug has to cause direct damage to different organs of the body, its consumption can lead to serious problems arising from other circumstances that are not always connected with this drug, including murders, traffic accidents and accidents at work, infectious diseases related to high-risk behaviour, and suicides. Cocaine is increasingly present in cases of violence such as fights or aggression, in many cases accompanied by the use of knives and firearms. Serious behavioural disorders are being seen more and more frequently in the healthcare services, and in clinics we are witnessing a worrying increase on a day-to-day basis of conflictive episodes associated with the use of cocaine amongst our patients. This damage does not only affect a marginal population, but instead all levels of society, and often goes unnoticed or unreported. Coordination between different institutions and healthcare areas is essential in order to obtain this information, and in this way to provide a more precise picture of the consequences of Cocaine consumption, as today we are still far from having quantified its true dimension.","578":"Addiction treatment aims to reduce the harm that addiction causes to individuals and society. However, many clinics, especially in the private sector, have ideological objections to using medico-pharmacological treatments and are often critical of other services that do offer pharmacological treatments. This situation contrasts sharply with the attitude of family planning (FP) clinics, even though they too aim to reduce harm. Ironically, the most anti-pharmacological clinics are often those which proclaim most loudly that addiction is a 'disease', while avoiding unwanted pregnancy, which is not usually seen as a disease, is widely and effectively achieved with medical techniques. FP clinics typically consider widely varying patterns of sexual behaviour, social contexts and patient attitudes in devising individual treatment plans, while addiction clinics commonly have a one-size-fits-all, take-it-or-leave- it approach. Addiction services could learn some useful clinical and ideological lessons from FP clinics.","579":"Peptic ulcer disease is a common clinical problem. Binge drinking has been shown to increase the risk of ulcer at the individual level. To estimate the aggregate level effect of binge drinking on duodenum ulcer mortality rate. Trends in age-adjusted, sex-specific fatal alcohol poisoning and duodenum ulcer mortality rates in Russia from 1965 to 2005 were analyzed employing an ARIMA analysis in order to asses a bivariate relationship between the two time series. Time series analysis indicate the presence of statistically significant association between the two series for male (r = 0.51; SE = 0.16). The association between the two time series for female is also positive, however, statistically not significant (r = 0.25; SE = 0.14). This paper present new epidemiological evidence of aggregate level relationship between alcohol and duodenum ulcer mortality rate. The outcome of this study also supports the hypothesis that binge drinking of strong spirits is a risk factor of ulcer at the individual level. ","580":"This study examines the concept of natural recovery (without formal treatment) from problems associated with alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and heroin abuse, each one alone or in any combination. Two groups of males (40 Ss between 18 and 60 years of age) and two groups of females (19 Ss between 18 and 55 years of age) with at least one year of abstinence were studied. The main issues considered were: reason for attending treatment or ceasing the use of substances, factors related to maintenance of abstinence, and difficulties and threats associated with abstinence. Several significant differences were found between groups with and without treatment, as well as between males and females, particularly regarding factors related to the maintenance of abstinence. In both cases family and affective links appear as the most relevant factors in the decision to stop using substances. On the other hand, commitment to one's goals and life project are the principal motives for maintaining abstinence or moderate consumption. This reflects the progressive transition from cognitive and emotional processes with external referents to processes with internal referents, associated with personal achievement.","581":"ASRS v.1.1. is a self-applied brief instrument for the screening of individuals presenting symptoms of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and proposed by the WHO. The purpose of the present work was to test the instrument and examine the results of its application to a sample of 280 individuals in treatment for substance-related disorders (cross-sectional descriptive study). We administered simultaneously in the initial phases of treatment the ASRS v.1.1. (short form) and the MCMI-II to the full sample and the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), ADHD-Rating Scale-IV and ASRS v.1.1. (complete form) to various sub-samples. Diagnostic interviews were also carried out and the psychometric properties and factorial structure of ASRS v.1.1. were explored. Good convergent validity, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic capability were obtained for the six-item version of ASRS v.1.1., even though 4 out of 6 items did not discriminate between Axis I and II disorders assessed through the MCMI-II and diagnostic interviews. According to DSM-IV-TR criteria the estimated prevalence of ADHD in the sample of addicts was 8.2%. ASRS v.1.1. is criticized as a specific instrument for ADHD detection, since most of its items appear to measure a non-specific dimension of compulsiveness\/impulsiveness, common to Axis-I and Axis-II disorders. Other criticisms made in the discussion concern the lack of specificity of DSM criteria and the confusion they generate among the concepts of symptom, sign and trait (including the impact on study results), the general use of the A criterion but the omission of the B, C, D and E criteria of the DSM category, differences in samples (with regard to both severity and selection criteria), and the artifactual increases in prevalence found in many studies.","582":"Recent epidemiological studies indicate that alcohol consumption in women has increased in the last few years, which suggests that alcoholism in women will also increase in the near future. Moreover, this disease shows differential characteristics in women, and knowledge of these characteristics is important so that treatment can begin as early as possible. The objective of the present study was to explore clinical differences in alcohol use disorders according to patients' gender. It was carried out with a sample of 370 patients, 325 men (87.8%) and 45 women (12.2%), with mean ages of 42.83 and 44.6 years, respectively. The patients were assessed through the Europasi interview and analytical studies with liver enzyme profiles and blood tests. The most notable results were: women began alcohol consumption significantly later than men (19.61 and 16.9 years, respectively; p &lt; 0.008); they were significantly older than men when the consumption pattern became problematic (30.93 and 24.68 years, respectively; p &lt; 0.003); they had been drinking for fewer years (13.26 versus 17.85 years; p &lt; 0.02); and they drank fewer grams of alcohol (117.7 and 133.8 g., respectively; n.s.). Women scored significantly higher than men on the Europasi psychiatric scale (2.91 and 1.97, respectively; p &lt; 0.007) and men had more legal problems than women (1.2 and 1.0, respectively; p &lt; 0.000). In the biological tests the GGT enzyme values were higher in men (137.51) than in women (96.7), but this difference was not significant, and the VCM value was significantly higher for women (98.1) than for men (95.05). Another important finding was that the percentage of women who had sought private professional help was higher than that of men (15% versus 4.6%; p &lt; 0.01).","583":"The aim of this paper was to describe the psychopathological and personality profile associated with alcohol dependence and to compare it with those of non-addictive disorders and the normal population. The sample consisted of 158 alcohol-dependent participants attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic, 120 psychiatric patients with non-addictive disorders and 103 participants from the general population chosen to match the patient samples for age, gender and socioeconomic level. All participants were assessed with different instruments related to personality (Impulsiveness Scale, Sensation-Seeking Scale and STAI), psychopathology (SCL-90-R, BDI and Maladjustment Scale) and personality disorders (MCMI-II). Patients from the clinical groups presented more symptoms of anxiety and depression than the healthy participants and had more problems adjusting to everyday life, but there were no differences between the two clinical groups. Alcohol-dependent patients were more impulsive and sensation-seeking than the other two groups. Histrionic, narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders were specific to the alcohol-dependent patients. The implications of this study for further research are discussed.","584":"This paper presents some of the main parameters in the behaviour pattern of young people in their binge drinking practices, seeking to improve the somewhat inaccurate view emerging from field studies. A total of 4083 questionnaires were administered to young people in Valencia aged 14-25 during the academic year 2005\/2006, from a random sample of schools and other educational institutions. The survey was conducted in the institutions themselves and participation was anonymous and voluntary. The findings confirm a progressive reduction in the age at which this practice begins, 13 having been the starting age for those adolescents who are currently 14 years old. Likewise, the results contradict the assertion that binge drinking is practised mainly by boys, as it is found to an equal extent in either sex. The European trend towards radicalisation of consumption is also confirmed: a considerable increase in the use of drinks with high alcohol content regardless of age and gender, resulting in mean blood alcohol levels of 1.5 gr. twice a week on average for more than 6 months a year. All of this is commonly combined with a misleading perception of the effects of alcohol consumption, the positive aspects being overestimated. These results underline the need to design selective or even indicated prevention programmes for approximately 20% of the most extreme cases, with a view to overcoming the current constraints of universal prevention. Nor should interventions overlook the issue of parental permissiveness--reflected in aspects such as early age of onset of binge-drinking or lack of controls on the time young people come home after partying.","585":"This paper aims to describe the prevalence of tobacco consumption among pre-adolescent and adolescent school children in Spain at the start of the 21st century. The data were collected within the framework of the \"Estilos de Vida de los Adolescentes Escolarizados\" (EVAE) project, a nationwide cross-sectional study on the lifestyles of adolescent school children. In this study, a random sample of 8429 students aged from 10 to 18 years old (49.9% boys and 50.1% girls) was selected. The school children filled in an anonymous questionnaire in their classrooms. Among the 12-year-old age group, there are a significantly higher number of boys than girls who have ever smoked tobacco. Figures are higher for girls in the 14-year-old or older age groups. Between the 12 and the 14-year-old age groups, there is an increase of 40 percentage points for girls who have ever smoked tobacco. The prevalence of daily smoking exceeds 10% among the 14-year-old or older age groups, with significantly higher rates for girls than for boys among the 15-year-old group and older students. Among the 17-year-old group, 25% of boys and 35% of girls report that they smoke daily. The recent experience of Spain and other countries shows that it is possible to significantly reduce the prevalence of tobacco consumption among school children within a few years. The primary prevention of tobacco consumption among adolescents can be highly effective and should constitute a priority for the health system, the education system and other sectors involved.","586":"Binge drinking is a pattern of heavy drinking which is observed all over Europe. The term Binge drinking implies a lot of different meanings to different people. The most popular definition used for this term is five or more 'standard drinks' in a single occasion. Binge drinking is different from intoxication, although this kind of heavy alcohol consumption can be lead to intoxication. This condition is manifested by different signs, for example slurred speech. Binge drinking is very common among the European population. In 2006 some 80 million Europeans aged 15 plus reported this kind of alcohol consumption patterns. European surveys showed that there is an increase of binge drinking across Europe amongst young people (15-16 years) old since 1995. The consequences of binge drinking contain acute and chronic effects, which are caused by long term alcohol use. The individual risks are brain damage, suicide, sexually transmitted diseases, etc. It has also an impact on harm to others than the drinkers. This includes violence and crime, accidents, etc. Each year in the European Union 2000 homicides are related to heavy drinking. There a lot of effective measures to reduce binge drinking. Strong evidence is shown by drink-driving laws, tax, reduced access to and availability of alcohol, brief interventions such as physician advice and advertising controls.","587":null,"588":"The association between alcohol and suicide is well documented. The solid body of research and empirical evidence suggests that hazardous pattern of alcohol consumption (binge drinking) lead to quicker and deeper intoxication, increasing the propensity for alcohol-related suicide. To estimate the aggregate level effect of binge drinking on suicide rate. Trends in suicide and fatal alcohol poisoning rate (as a proxy for binge drinking) from 1970 to 2005 in Belarus were analyzed employing ARIMA analysis in order to assess bivariate relationship between two time series. The results of time series analysis suggests close relationship between suicide and fatal alcohol poisoning rate at aggregate level. This study supports the hypothesis that suicide and alcohol closely connected in culture with prevailing intoxication-oriented drinking patterns and adds to the growing body of evidence that a substantial proportion of suicide in Belarus is due to acute effect of binge drinking. ","589":"As part of a pioneer investigation line on the field of addiction and mental health centred on the operationalization of clinical implications of the motivational theory of Maslow (1954\/1970) and feedback treatment and prevention strategies of drug use and its associated disturbances, it is tested the psycho-pathogenesis construct of this theory by means of a cross sectional design of four independent samples, on which it is explored the satisfaction degree of 16 deficitary needs on intentional samples of adolescents and young adults: Three samples of actual users of marihuana (n = 47), cocaine (n = 47) and both substances (n = 50), that were gotten between treatment solicitors and a sample of students and workers non illicit drug users (n = 150). The comparative and predictive statistical analysis provide validity to the psycho-pathogenesis construct of the theory of motivation of Maslow, and its stand out: 1)The potential utility for the treatment of the development of techniques and instruments oriented to cover the deficit of satisfaction of the needs of health, tranquillity, order, emotional security, family justice, love, friendship, respect, tenderness, power, domination, success and money and; 2) The importance for the prevention of the actual consumption of drugs as cocaine or marihuana of the development of strategies focused to keep satisfied the needs of health, tranquillity, affection, respect and success.","590":"This work pursues two objectives: 1) to analyse time trends in tobacco consumption among Spanish schoolchildren aged 11, 13, 15 and 17 for the period 1986-2002; and 2) to study the evolution of gender differences regarding tobacco consumption in each of these age groups throughout this period. On the basis of a research with a sequential cross-sectional design, data were collected in four nation-wide studies (in 1986, 1990, 1994 and 2002), using representative samples of Spanish schoolchildren. The sub-samples used for this paper add up 14,570 subjects (51.2% girls and 48.8% boys). The analysis of temporal trends has been performed separately for each gender, within each age group. Among 11-year-olds, a growing homogeneity between genders concerning tobacco consumption has been proved, with a general trend to a decrease in the problem. Among 13-year-olds, time trends are very similar to 11-year-olds, except for the period 1994-2002, where there has been an increase in the prevalence of smoking among girls. As for the 15 and 17-year-olds, a growing differentiation between genders has been proved, with a marked rising tendency among girls in all aspects studied. Regarding boys of those ages, the situation is relatively stable since 1990. The spreading of this problem among girls will probably strengthen in the future the current trend toward an increase in tobacco consumption among Spanish adult women.","591":"The relation between alcohol and jealousy is a deeply rooted belief within the general population as well as in the medical, and particularly psychiatric, environment. Furthermore, in recent years there has been a growing interest on the forensic aspects of pathological jealousy, since they are a frequent cause of severe violence, homicide and suicide. Some authors have described a high prevalence of pathological jealousy in alcoholic patients, even awarding it a pathognomonic value in alcoholism. Nevertheless, recent studies do not completely support this relation, and draw attention to other factors. Results from the various studies contain several definitions and classifications of pathological jealousy, and although most of them highlight the prevalence of jealousy in alcoholic patients, they question its pathognomonic quality. Also, the presence of pathological jealousy in subjects with psychiatric disorders other than alcoholism is suggested, indicating the existence of predisposing and triggering factors which could explain the development of pathological jealousy. Yet, the important methodological difficulties in the published articles and the shortage of studies do not allow the confirmation of the alcoholic etiology in pathological jealousy; this is the reason why considering alcoholic jealousy as a separate entity is debatable. In this sense, the best diagnosis in these patients would be paranoid disorder combined with alcoholic dependence, hence, a dual diagnosis.","592":"The aim of the present study is to analyse the evolution, at 12-months, of patients with cocaine dependence undergoing treatment in drug abuse centres. We examined the relationship between sociodemographic variables, drug use characteristics, and psychopathological characteristics with maintenance of drug abstinence and the evolution of daily functioning evaluated by the therapist at 3-, 6- and 12-months. The most outstanding results are that subjects with a dependent personality pattern, according to the MCMI-II, are more likely to maintain cocaine abstinence during the 12-months following the preliminary assessment. Moreover, the variables more related with a worse daily functioning at 12-months are injected or smoked cocaine use, previous treatments for drug use and having used heroin on some occasion. Therefore, drug related aspects and not psychopathological characteristics are more important when analysing the 12-months evolution in these subjects.","593":"The aim of the current research is to ascertain any possible relationship that could exist between the alcohol consumption of the population and several sociodemographic variables, in addition to the influence of physical exercise\/sports on the creation of healthy lifestyle habits. The sample comprised 1102 subjects from Almeria Spain, over 14 years of age, to whom we administered the \"physical exercise\/sporting habits and life styles\" questionnaire, selecting the sections on physical exercise\/sporting habits in leisure, fitness and state of health perception and alcohol consumption habits, related to attitudes, behavioural and sociodemographic variables. We used an innovative tool for data analysis in the sphere of physical exercise, known as the Bayesian networks, emphasizing a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and physical exercise\/sporting activities, it being the active people, with an interest in physical exercise\/sports, who have a good perception of their health and physical fitness who are the ones who make habitual and occasional use of this substance. The profile of the individual who does not drink alcohol is female, over 44 years of age, with no studies, housewives who have a poor perception of their health, and who do not do any physical exercise or plays sports, whereas the populations with health risks, are men between 15 and 44 years of age who have secondary school studies or a degree and who work in the public or private sector.","594":"Coffee, tea, chocolate and caffeinated drinks are the main sources of caffeine, which is consumed in almost all ages and socioeconomic levels. Caffeine acts as a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist in the central nervous system. Its main effects are as psychostimulant, acting in addition on the respiratory, muscular and cardiovascular systems. Basically, caffeine is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 1A2 enzymes (CYP1A2). Several drugs can interact with its metabolism. The observed interindividual differences of its effects can be explained by variations in its metabolism. The main therapeutic use of caffeine is bronchodilator in respiratory diseases. Other possible uses are under investigation. Acute or chronic consumption of caffeine can induce several adverse effects, including intoxication that can be lethal. Finally, caffeine can be considered a drug of abuse. It has positive reinforcing actions, produces tolerance, and a withdrawal syndrome after stopping its consumption. Caffeine can cause different mental disorders such as dependence, which is not included in the DSM-IV-R, withdrawal syndrome and intoxication. Depending on its use, caffeine can be considered a nutrient, a drug or a drug of abuse.","595":null,"596":"","597":"Cannabis use is extremely prevalent in young people and there is controversy over the psychosocial harm of this use. One risk stands out--that of the possibility of cannabis being a risk factor of an illness as serious and incapacitating as schizophrenia. An avalanche of information has emerged recently on this subject, which it is essential to review. There are a number of cohort studies that support the idea of cannabis use as inducing psychotic symptoms and a precipitating factor of schizophrenia. These studies haves some methodological limitations, which we subject to critical analysis, such as the different outcome evaluations, heterogeneity in the measurements of vulnerability to the psychosis, the difficulty in controlling the possible confusion factors and the inadequate interpretation of the results obtained. In conclusion, we consider that the use of cannabis is clearly associated with the inducement of psychotic symptoms and is, possibly, a risk factor of schizophrenia in people with a genetic or psychosocial vulnerability, preventive methods being necessary in high-risk groups. These are fundamentally those of users of large quantities of cannabis and those who initiate use in adolescence.","598":null,"599":null,"600":"The objective of this article is to analyse the opinions of adolescents and young people, from gypsy and non-gypsy populations, on the relationship between recreational drug use and sexual practices that increase the risk of HIV infection. A descriptive qualitative research was undertaken. 14 focus groups were conducted with 98 adolescents and young people, and 7 semi-structured interviews with young recreational drug users. Both sort of results were triangulated. Two major discursive lines emerge in the analysis. The first one defends the notion that moderate consumption of alcohol facilitates the sexual encounter, but it does not imply risky behaviours. However, polydrug use or an elevated use of recreational drugs is related to a lack of concern for sexual risks, and in men with the loss of sexual sensitivity that sometimes justifies not using a condom. The second line argues other reasons for the non-use of condoms, such as their lack of availability, confidence in one's sexual partner, a concept of desire as something uncontrollable, infatuation and the state of mind or self-esteem. Some recommendations to prevent sexual transmission of HIV are derived from the results, such as the distribution of condoms in places where alcohol and other drugs are consumed, publicising the use of condoms and other latex barriers for oral genital sexual practices, working with young males on the optimisation of pleasure, designing preventive interventions targeting stable partners, and training adolescent girls in the social skills needed to negotiate the use of condoms.","601":"Perceived self-efficacy in being able to resist taking drugs when faced with situations of stress or social pressure was studied using the Drug Taking Confidence Questionnaire (DTCQ; Annis and Martin, 1985). In general, stronger self-efficacy is associated with the achievement of therapeutic objectives. We studied the predictive capacity of this questionnaire, administered at the beginning of treatment to a sample of substance-addicts in respect of compliance with objectives. We made a psychometric study of the instrument and its relationship with personality variables assessed with MCMI-II and VIP Data suggest that: (1) 50 DTCQ items can be reduced to 8 and even to 3 in order to achieve the same results, (2) self-efficacy at the beginning of treatment only predicts outcomes in the short-term, and (3) self-efficacy is a characteristic that is explained on the basis of personality structure. The best results are obtained from intermediate self-efficacy scores, whereas very low or very high scores predict poor outcome levels and display strong correlations with psychopathologic variables.","602":"The aim is to determine the effect of the treatment with venlafaxine extended release in patients with alcohol or cocaine dependence disorder that initiate detoxification treatment. Observational, open, prospective study carried out in Spain in 2005. 55 patients older than 18 years of age with diagnosis of alcohol and\/or cocaine dependence disorder, hospitalized in Specialty Care Center to initiate detoxification treatment, were included. Daily doses of 75 to 225 mg of venlafaxine extended release were administered for 6 months. Treatment was associated with significant reductions in EuropASI scores in the following areas: 3, alcohol use, baseline and final score of 8.2 +\/- 0.2 and 6.4 +\/- 0.4, respectively (P &lt; 0.01); 5, family\/social relations, initial score of 6.9 +\/- 0.2 and of 5.2 +\/- 0.5 at endpoint (P &lt; 0.001); 1, medical status, scores of 3.7 +\/- 0.4 and 0.9 +\/- 0.3 (baseline and final visits, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001); and 6, psychiatric status, with a baseline score of 7.8 +\/- 0.1 and final score of 5.4 +\/- 0.4 (P &lt; 0.001). The VAS alcohol craving scores at baseline were 26.7 +\/- 4.6, decreasing to 4.1 +\/- 1.5 at endpoint (P &lt; 0.001). The results of this observational study suggest that venlafaxine extended release could be effective as a coadyuvant in the treatment of alcohol dependent patients in alcohol detoxification therapy. Nevertheless, this should be confirmed with bigger placebo-controlled samples. ","603":"To estimate the predictive relevance for drug use of recreational nightlife related variables in comparison with other intrapersonal and interpersonal risk \/ protective factors. 806 young people interviewed by Irefrea in recreational nightlife environments from 4 Spanish cities during year 2001. The sample was approximately balanced by drug use (users and non-users), gender and age group (adolescents and young adults). Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire comprising questions on demographics, drug use frequency and related attitudes, sensation seeking, risk and deviant behaviours, habits on recreational nightlife, peer and family characteristics and mediating variables. Multivariate predictors for drug use were several intrapersonal and interpersonal risk \/ protective factors: ever used tobacco and alcohol, lower religiosity and risk perception for drug use, involvement in risk behaviours and in problem behaviours, more favourable attitudes for drug use, peer drug use and bonding with drug-using peers. Drug users are also distinguished from non-users by their recreational habits (greater involvement, specific significance and cultural and physical context in recreational nightlife). A global multivariate logistic regression analysis correctly classified 92% individuals using legal and illegal drugs. Among the factors studied, recreational styles were between the best predictors of drug use. It suggests the need to make an in depth study of weekend recreational habits and add them to the objectives of the prevention of drug use and misuse. ","604":"The experience in the United States regarding drug abuse prevention has involved three entities: scientific researchers, practitioners who work with youth, and policy makers. To the degree that each of these entities play complimentary roles, society benefits. In the past, these three entities have not collaborated or taken advantage of the strengths that each has to offer. Future goals should place an emphasis on scientific researchers contributing to the development and rigorous testing of programmatic approaches. Practitioners not only need to adopt effective programs and implement with fidelity, but also need to provide scientists opportunities to collaborate in order to make programs work for specific settings and populations. Finally, policy makers need to support prevention with funding and policy that is friendly to effective prevention and immune from political whims. Entities outside the United States can learn from the thirty years of experience of prevention experienced in North America.","605":"In the last few years, resilience, or the successful adaptation achieved by an individual despite very adverse or traumatic situations during their childhood, has become a concept of great importance both in the field of mental health and in drug abuse. Understanding how these individuals attain a level of normal functioning without developing personal or psychopathological problems in their adolescence or adulthood is of great relevance in not only the prevention but also the treatment of several disorders. In this paper we revised the studies that have analysed the relationship between resilience and drug consumption (tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs). The studies, both longitudinal and transversal, indicate that a number of individuals can be resilient (can make a normal adaptation) in adolescence or in adult life, in spite of having suffered serious traumas or adversities in their childhood. Several studies have shown clearly that resilience is a protective factor in determining whether or not an individual uses or abuses different drugs. We conclude that this concept is of great relevance to the field of drug use and abuse and, specifically, for the development of preventive programmes based on resilience.","606":"We present in this work a descriptive study of series of cases in treatment for nicotine addiction with a multicomponent program focusing on a systemic-relational therapy. While a good number of smokers are able to stop smoking, with the help of different programs with different levels of complexity depending on their level of addiction, there is a group of smokers who associate their difficulty to stop smoking with aspects related to their life cycle situation, problems with their family of origin or with their social network. We revised the most relevant clinical aspects of the model and presented the results of a descriptive study of a series of 128 patients, of wich 60.50% expressed family and\/or personal problems that made the possibilities of success in the program more difficult. After an intervention that lasted a year during wich there were 25 therapy sessions together with combined substitute therapy with nicotine (STN) during the first 3 months of treatment, 77.30% maintained abstinence. Nowadays we know much more about nicotine addictions, giving different answers to different needs, just like the different levels of complexity of each addict. We consider that the contributions of the systemic-relational model in its different ways of understanding the intervention, can better the results of the treatment. We are justified in increasing the level of complexity of the interventions when there exist complications in the clinical handling of nicotine addiction because of other models of treatment of lesser intensity.","607":"The concordance of the physical and mental component summary scores of the Short Form (SF)-36 has been established using the SF-12 in general and selected patient populations but has yet to be assessed in patients with drug addiction. To investigate whether a shorter health status instrument, the short form (SF)-12, is comparable with its longer version, the SF-36, for measuring health-related quality of life of patients with addictive disorders in treatment with methadone. A cross-sectional study was carried out on a stratified random sample (n= 726) of users included in the Methadone Maintenance Programmes in the Basque Country in Spain. The SF-36 Health Survey was used and the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) of the SF-36 and SF-12 were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and linear regression were used to assess the ability of the SF-12 physical component summary (PCS-12) scores to predict PCS-36 scores and the SF-12 mental component summary (MCS-12) scores to predict MCS-36 scores. The concordance between the SF-12 and the SF-36 on both physical (ICC = 0.97) and mental (ICC = 0.98) component summary scores (PCS and MCS respectively) is high and the relationship is linear and positive. Most of the variance in the SF-36 PCS (R2 = 0.88) and MCS (R2 = 0.91) can be explained by their SF-12 counterparts. The SF-12 reproduced SF-36 summary scores without substantial loss of information when used on patients undergoing methadone treatment. The SF-12 appears to be an efficient alternative to the SF-36 for the assessment of health-related quality of life of patients with addictive disorders and their treatment. ","608":"Cocaine use is an increasingly serious problem in Spain. The absence of effective drugs for the treatment of cocaine addiction and of empirically validated therapy programmes makes it necessary to resort to programmes that have shown their effectiveness in other countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the effectiveness of one of the programmes that has obtained the best results in the United States: the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) Plus Vouchers for the treatment of cocaine addiction. We assessed treatment retention and dropout rates and cocaine use during the first three months of intervention. The sample was made up of 37 patients addicted to cocaine who were assigned at random to one of two conditions: experimental (CRA Plus Vouchers) or control (Standard Treatment), both in the outpatient context. The results showed that 85.7% of the experimental group patients completed 12 weeks of treatment, compared to 69.6% of the control group. In the experimental group, 57.1% of the patients maintained continuous abstinence, compared to 39.1% of the control group. These results coincide with those of previous studies, all from outside Spain. Nevertheless, longer-term studies with larger samples are necessary in order to confirm the effectiveness of this program.","609":null,"610":"Cocaine consumption in Spain continues to rise and is reaching an alarming level. This is a descriptive and correlational study in which a transcultural analysis is made with a sample of 62 different countries. The aim of this study is to compare the influence of macrosocial, cultural and economic variables on the behaviour of cocaine abuse. Thus, the importance of the cocaine traffic and supply is shown in relation to the abuse of the same, but recognition and emphasis is given to the presence of other explanatory factors characteristic of societies in which cocaine is abused and demanded. These factors are: predominance of cultural values of self-expression, high index of subjective wellbeing and a high GNP per capita. Finally, the relevance of social factors, environment and socio-economic context, as determinants of cocaine abuse from a trans-cultural perspective, are discussed. The implementation of different actions is proposed: the promotion of values oriented towards self-regulation and self-control, the control of the cocaine supply (direct and indirect), combating early cultural destruction by means of publicity and promoting cultural creation and the diversification of leisure.","611":"","612":"The scientific literature consistently reports that while children of substance abusers may be at biological, psychological, or environmental risk, the effects of these risks can be abbreviated through the use of effective interventions and treatments. Research has consistently demonstrated reductions in family and child dysfunction when effective family intervention programs are consistently utilized. While a number of effective family-based approaches have been developed and evaluated, only a few have been designed specifically for children of substance abusing parents. Just two have been tested in randomized control trials -The Streghtening Families Program and Focus on the Family. The Streghtening Families Program has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in family and child dysfunctions across several ethnocultural groups when consistently utilized. Clinical and advanced graduate programs should stress training in these evidence-based practices as well as how to adapt these models to be more culturally sensitive and age or gender appropriate in order to serve a growing and needy population of families.","613":"Although ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is the most widely consumed drug in the Western society, ethanol mechanisms of action in the Central Nervous System (CNS) remain unknown. In consequence, the development of pharmacological strategies to treat excessive alcohol consumption and alcoholism has proven to be difficult. A major difficulty in those attempts arises from the molecular properties of ethanol, which do not allow a sterocomplementary binding to any known receptor. Therefore, over the last years, it has been proposed that a large number of effects observed alter ethanol administration\/consumption might be actually mediated by its first metabolite, namely acetaldehyde, produced inside the CNS via catalase activity. Nowadays, a large number of evidences support this proposal, leading the possibility of new pharmacological strategies (i.e. pharmacological inactivation of acetaldehyde) in the management of alcohol excessive consumption."},"articletitle":{"0":"Smoking cessation treatment attendance among smokers with substance use disorders.","1":"Impact evaluation of European strategy on Spanish National Plan on Drugs and the role of civil society.","2":"Systematic review on the clinical management of chronic pain and comorbid opioid use disorder.","3":"Impact of the legalisation of recreational cannabis use.","4":"Review of the questionnaries used to detect alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the Green Page.","5":"A preliminary exploration on psychological variables related to online social network addiction.","6":"Waterpipe use among adolescents.
