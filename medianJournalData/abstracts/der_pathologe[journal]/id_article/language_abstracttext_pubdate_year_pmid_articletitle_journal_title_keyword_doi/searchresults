Of equal interest is the counter-question: were pathologists honoured who had made (party)political commitments to National Socialism during the \"Third Reich\"?A total of 9 Virchow medallists and 3 honorary members met the inclusion criteria. None of those affected belonged to the group of pathologists who suffered injustice during the \"Third Reich\" or who could be described as victims of the Nazis. On the other hand, 4 of the 9 German Virchow medal winners and 1 of the 3 honorary members had joined the National Socialist Party and to some extent other Nazi organisations.

Neutrophilic infiltrates and pustular eruptions are caused by different noninfectious immunomechanisms. For some of them, mutations have been found (e.g. NLRC4 mutation in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) leading to activation of the inflammasome; IL36RN mutation in pustular psoriasis resulting in uncontrolled IL36 signaling).

The majority of breast cancers fulfilling these criteria show hormone receptor positivity and with regard to prognosis resemble luminal type of breast cancer from which they are not fundamentally different. Despite lacking clinical relevance the up-coming WHO classification of breast cancer will nevertheless introduce the new category of NET luminal type. Immunohistochemical detection of neuroendocrine marker alone cannot be considered as sufficient for classification because it can frequently be encountered in other types of breast cancer (e.g. mucinous, solid papillary). From low grade NET with good differentiation those with poor differentiation and most frequently small cell appearance have to be differentiated. Poorly differentiated NET can primarily originate in the breast, which may be indicated by intraductal growth and co-expression of GATA3 but in these cases metastasis of extra mammary cancers has to be considered and correlation with the clinical findings is required for correct classification.","316":null,"317":"Michael Mihatsch, born in 1943 in Gleiwitz, studied medicine in Bonn and Freiburg, and then went to Basel to begin studying pathology.

As part of the habilitation project various prognostic biomarkers were analyzed and correlated with the occurrence of distant metastases and different patterns of distant spread in CRC. It could be demonstrated that CRC with microsatellite instability (MSI), as detected by a loss of hMLH1 protein expression, have a very low risk of distant metastases. In contrast, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC (with positive hMLH1 expression) with concurrent activation of the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway and strong expression of the cancer stem cell marker CD133, exhibit a very high risk for liver metastases. From these observations a two-step immunohistochemical algorithm based on three immunohistochemical stains could be derived, allowing CRC to be classified according to the risk of distant metastases. Further studies demonstrated that a deregulation of the Wnt-beta catenin signaling pathway and the expression of cancer stem cell markers, such as CD133 and CD44 correlated with hematogenous metastasis to the liver but not with peritoneal carcinomatosis or hematogenous metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS). Finally, in CRC patients with CNS metastases, increased rates of mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway (KRAS and BRAF mutations) in combination with a low beta catenin expression could be detected.

As a central core subunit responsible for the integrity of the SDH complex, the expression of SDHB is lost in all SDH-deficient neoplasms irrespective of the specific SDH subunit affected by a genetic mutation in addition to concurrent loss of the subunit specifically affected by genetic alteration. Accordingly, all SDH-deficient neoplasms are by definition SDHB-deficient. The SDH-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has only recently been well-characterized and it is included as a specific subtype of RCC in the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification published in 2016.

Differential diagnoses are chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC), renal oncocytoma (RO), the oncocytic variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma (OPRCC), the eosinophilic variant of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and hybrid oncocytic chromophobe tumors (HOCT). In difficult cases that cannot be resolved by morphology alone, immunohistochemistry is usually helpful. The RO and ChRCC show positive reactions for CD117, they are negative for vimentin and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), while CCRCC are positive for vimentin and OPRCC are positive for AMACR. To distinguish between RO and ChRCC, CK7, claudin-7 (both strongly positive in ChRCC and negative or patchy positive in RO) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) can be used (positive in ChRCC, negative in RO); however, a diagnosis may remain difficult in some cases even with the use of immunohistochemistry.

These methods especially help to identify clinically important genetically unstable cells as the hallmark of carcinoma in situ (CIS). Little is known about the clinical significance of the morphological subtypes of CIS, which range from large cell to micropapillary variants.

In general, they behave in a benign fashion but there are rare cases with malignant transformation, so that careful examination and surveillance are necessary. Differential diagnoses include Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, metastasized endometrioid carcinoma and the FATWO-like variant of the endometrioid carcinoma of the fallopian tubes. The FATWOs express pancytokeratin, CD10, vimentin, calretinin and inhibin A.

These are important supplementary methods and prerequisites for a grading as low, intermediate and high-grade in addition to classical histology and cytology. Cytometry of DNA can confirm the cell kinetics of prostate cancer by detection of a predominance of diploid or aneuploid cell nuclei but should only be evaluated together with histological investigations. All histology-based analyses of cell kinetics encompass the classical highly and poorly differentiated glandular and cribriform patterns as well as solid undifferentiated structures and the various subcategories. The malignancy grading of prostate cancer can result from the summation of histological grading and cell kinetic analyses, as long as the named investigations are included. The future perspectives of individualized therapy options, including active surveillance in early low-grade and also for high-grade prostate cancer and new antihormonal treatment in advanced disease, may increasingly rely on tissue biomarkers and advanced technologies for whole genome analysis including next generation sequencing.

For pathologists it is important to histologically diagnose and specify such variants. Nested variants of urothelial carcinoma with inconspicuous, well-formed tumor cell nests present with an aggressive course. The plasmacytoid variant, which morphologically resembles plasma cells is associated with a shorter survival time and a high frequency of peritoneal metastasis. Micropapillary urothelial carcinoma with small papillary tumor cell islands within artificial tissue retraction spaces and frequent lymphovascular invasion also has a poor prognosis. Other important rare differential variants listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification are microcystic, lymphoepithelioma-like, sarcomatoid, giant cell and undifferentiated urothelial carcinomas. Additionally, there are three special types of bladder cancer: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder. These tumors are characterized by pure squamous cell or glandular differentiation and are sometimes less responsive to adjuvant (chemo)therapy. Small cell carcinoma of the bladder mimics the neuroendocrine features of its pulmonary counterpart, shows an aggressive course but is sensitive to (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy. The morphology and histology of the most important variants and special types are discussed in this review. ","794":"For many tumor entities, especially in breast cancer, an intraductal carcinoma is generally perceived as a precursor lesion, which precedes the emergence of invasive carcinoma. Therefore, in addition to parameters of the invasive carcinoma, histological parameters of the intraductal component have always played an important role in therapy planning of breast cancer. This is different in prostate cancer and although the term \"intraductal carcinoma\" has long been propagated by some authors, its routine use remains rare and inconsistent. This is certainly not only due to the far simpler therapy options of prostate cancer, in which focal and organ-preserving therapies still play a subordinate role, but also due to substantial interobserver variation and our inconsistent perception of intraductal carcinomas. This article gives a brief overview of currently available literature on this topic and explains why intraductal carcinoma of the prostate deserves our attention. In contrast to breast cancer, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate usually represents a post-invasive lesion, in which an aggressive tumor exhibits spread into pre-existing ducts; however, in rare cases, intraductal carcinoma may represent a true precursor lesion.

These tumors most frequently occur sporadically but in rare cases can be associated with syndromes. These tumor entities show characteristic morphological changes, which in combination with specific immunohistochemical markers facilitate the diagnosis. Recent results of molecular pathological investigations, especially beta-catenin mutation analysis, allow a better categorization of these tumor entities. ","796":"Therapeutic decisions for breast cancer are increasingly becoming based on subtype-specific gene expression tests. For bladder cancer very similar subtypes have been identified by genome-wide mRNA analysis, which as for breast cancer differ with respect to the prognosis and response to therapy on the basis of their hormone dependency. At the DNA level, however, the type of mutations and their frequencies within the subtypes are strikingly different between bladder and breast cancers. It will be interesting to see whether possible driver mutations can serve as therapeutic targets in both indications. In contrast, the apparent hormone dependency of a substantial number of bladder carcinomas suggests that hormonal and anti-hormonal treatment can be valid therapy options similar to breast cancer. Moreover, gender-specific differences with respect to the incidence and aggressiveness of male compared to female bladder cancers can be explained by hormonal effects. Together with forthcoming immunomodulatory therapies these multiple therapy options raise and give new hope to efficiently combat this aggressive disease.

They encompass a heterogeneous group of reactive pseudosarcomatous tumor-like changes and benign neoplastic lesions as well as malignant neoplasms (sarcomas) with variable biological behavior.

This procedure improves the diagnostic precision and safety. Unlike other European countries in Germany both procedures are performed by different specialties. Cytology is the responsibility of hematologists whereas histology is carried out by pathologists, which interferes with an integrative diagnostic approach unless intense communication takes place. Ideally, in the diagnosis of hematological disorders histology of bone marrow trephines should be studied in conjunction with smears of peripheral blood and bone marrow. In many instances, further complementary investigations, such as flow cytometry, cytogenetics and increasingly molecular pathological studies are necessary to guarantee an adequate modern state of diagnostics in hematopathology.

Cytopathology also suffers from a lack of next generation cytologists, because experienced and interested specialists as well as assistants actively engaged in cytology (ZTA, cytological technical assistant and MTLA medical laboratory technical assistant) are only available in limited numbers. However, cytopathological expertise is urgently needed, not only in the diagnostics of gynecological cancer screening but also for assessment of many non-gynecological preparations, which have nowadays become more demanding and more complex particularly due to the technical developments in internal medicine. In addition, adjuvant methods have become incorporated into cytopathology, the interpretation of which must be carried out within this specialty.This article gives a review of the status quo of cytopathology in Germany and sketches how training and advanced education opportunities are organized and if necessary could be improved. The course of specialist medical training as well as the ZTA and MTLA training are described, also as a teaching concept (e.g. microscopy of current cases, microscopy of case collections and online microscopy).

","832":null,"833":"Defects in the regulation of cell death are important causes for both the development and therapy resistance of malignant tumors. Several distinct, molecularly defined types of cell death are known, such as apoptosis, anoikis, and necroptosis. Moreover, the specific triggering of cell death plays an important role in the prevention of metastasis. The results of recent studies have shown that various types of cell death are pivotal at different steps of the metastasis cascade, in order to prevent cellular detachment, migration, invasion, intravasation, extravasation and the establishment of micrometastasis and macrometastasis. At the subcellular level, numerous links exist between cell death regulation and metastasis, specifically regarding signaling pathways and individual proteins with dual or multiple functions. As an example, the decoy receptor 3 protein (DcR3) functions both as an anti-apoptotic protein and as a direct promotor of invasion and migration of tumor cells. In summary, the specific triggering of cell death plays a pivotal role for the prevention of metastasis. On the other hand, the stepwise process of metastasis represents a mechanism of selection resulting in established metastases with a multiresistant phenotype which corresponds to the clinical observation that many metastasized cancers are therapy resistant. In the future, innovative diagnostic tests to individually predict the resistance pattern and possibilities to overcome resistance are urgently needed. ","834":"Disseminated tumor cells require a special microenvironment to form metastases. This metastatic niche is organ specific and forms prior to the establishment of visible metastases. The niche is characterized by vascular remodeling and bone marrow-derived cells which have migrated into it. Studies by other groups and our own results have already shown that intranodal lymphangiogenesis is an important prerequisite for regional lymph node metastases in rectal cancer patients, and can be used as a prognostic marker for progression-free survival. Niche cells such as endothelia secrete factors that attract tumor and bone marrow-derived cells. CXCL12 is one of these factors. CXCL12 activates the CXCR4 chemokine axis and induces migration along its gradient. Several factors, such as hypoxia, have been described to regulate CXCR4 function and surface expression on tumor cells. Low molecular weight agents have been used to block CXCR4 activation. This review focuses on the function and regulation of CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 in metastases formation. It also discusses potential options for therapeutic blockage.

Within the field of oncology, liquid biopsy can potentially be used to monitor tumor burden in the blood and to early detect emerging resistance in the course of targeted cancer therapies. An already approved application of liquid biopsy is the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driver mutations in blood samples of lung cancer patients in those cases where no tissue biopsy is available. However, there is still currently considerable insecurity associated with blood-based DNA analytic methods that must be solved before liquid biopsy can be implemented for broader routine application in the diagnosis of cancer. In this article, the current state of development of liquid biopsy in molecular diagnostics from a pathology point of view is presented. ","836":"Tumor diagnostics are based on histomorphology, immunohistochemistry and molecular pathological analysis of mutations, translocations and amplifications which are of diagnostic, prognostic and\/or predictive value. In recent decades only histomorphology was used to classify lung cancer as either small (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although NSCLC was further subdivided in different entities; however, as no specific therapy options were available classification of specific subtypes was not clinically meaningful. This fundamentally changed with the discovery of specific molecular alterations in adenocarcinoma (ADC), e.g. mutations in KRAS, EGFR and BRAF or translocations of the ALK and ROS1 gene loci, which now form the basis of targeted therapies and have led to a significantly improved patient outcome. The diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of imaging, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics as well as their interaction were systematically assessed in a large cohort with available clinical data including patient survival. Specific and sensitive diagnostic markers and marker panels were defined and diagnostic test algorithms for predictive biomarker assessment were optimized. It was demonstrated that the semi-quantitative assessment of ADC growth patterns is a stage-independent predictor of survival and is reproducibly applicable in the routine setting. Specific histomorphological characteristics correlated with computed tomography (CT) imaging features and thus allowed an improved interdisciplinary classification, especially in the preoperative or palliative setting. Moreover, specific molecular characteristics, for example BRAF mutations and the proliferation index (Ki-67) were identified as clinically relevant prognosticators. Comprehensive clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular assessment of NSCLCs allow an optimized patient stratification. Respective algorithms now form the backbone of the 2015 lung cancer World Health Organization (WHO) classification. ","837":"Pathology is the field of medicine that studies diseases. Ancient Greece hosted some of the earliest societies that laid the structural foundations of pathology. Initially, knowledge was based on observations but later on the key elements of pathology were established based on the dissection of animals and the autopsy of human cadavers. Christianized Greece under Ottoman rule (1453-1821) was not conducive to the development of pathology. After liberation, however, a series of events took place that paved the way for the establishment and further development of the specialty. The appointment in 1849 of two Professors of Pathology at the Medical School of Athens for didactical purposes proved to be the most important step in fostering the field of pathology in modern Greece. Presently in Greece there are seven university departments and 74 pathology laboratories in public hospitals, employing 415 specialized pathologists and 90 residents. The First Department of Pathology at the Medical School of Athens University is the oldest (1849) and largest in Greece, encompassing most pathology subspecialties.

Although these developments hold great promise for our patients, we must be aware of important limitations and pitfalls in routine diagnostic high throughput sequencing. This includes scientific, technical, social but also economic aspects which have to be addressed. In this article, the respective topics are systematically analyzed and considerations and possible solutions for the successful implementation of MPS technologies into patient care are discussed. ","841":"Although advances in targeted therapies have recently been achieved, lung cancer remains a major health burden worldwide. It is therefore pivotal to investigate the biology of lung cancers in order to design new therapeutic strategies. To address this a multi-antibody assay has been developed for the classification of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using this assay the pathologist is able to reliably subtype NSCLC into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS) large cell carcinoma, as required by the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of 2015, on a single glass slide. In our cohort this classification algorithm showed significant differences in overall survival of the therapeutically important subgroups, which reflects the accuracy of the assay. To investigate the biology of NSCLC subtypes further, several proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism were analyzed. In a hierarchical cluster analysis it could be shown that adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma harbor different metabolic shifts and, furthermore, that two distinct groups of squamous cell carcinoma seem to exist, a hypoxia and a transporter type. These results could be verified by analysis of mRNA data obtained from the TCGA database. As a close association between tumor metabolism and anti-tumor immune response has been reported, the lymphocytic infiltrates were characterized with respect to T-cells and their location within the tumor. Besides a negative correlation of lymphocyte density and expression of lactate dehydrogenase, it could be shown that depending on the location and type a high lymphocyte density indicates a significantly better overall survival of NSCLC patients. Investigating the expression of PD-L1 in NSCLC cells, a significant correlation with lymphocyte density was detected. In conclusion, the multi-antibody assay is a new and economically attractive tool for a reliable subclassification of NSCLC. This subtyping results in a better biological stratification of NSCLC and is the basis not only for palliative treatment options but also for further investigations on NSCLC biology. It was discovered that metabolic changes during malignant transformation are different in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The latter group can be further divided into a hypoxia and a transporter type. Anti-tumor immune responses are influenced by the metabolic shift in NSCLC and lymphocyte density with respect to the location within the tumor is of prognostic significance in NSCLC. Therefore, the results contribute to a better biological understanding of NSCLC and may lead to new treatment options by targeting metabolic enzymes or triggering anti-tumor responses.

For some tumour entities UICC proposals exist for a subclassification of metastases: colorectal cancer, lung cancer, malignant bone tumours, malignant melanoma and Merkel cell carcinomas of skin, as well as uterine and prostate cancer. Metastases are graded according to the same principles as the corresponding primary tumours. Differences in the grade between primary tumour and metastases have been described without evident differences in prognosis.

Thus, the four-tier classification system of cytological findings (i.e. negative, atypical cells but significance uncertain, suspicious and positive) refers to high-grade tumor cells only. Furthermore, for valid cytological diagnostics not only the cytological specimen but also clinical information on cystoscopy findings and, if applicable, a biopsy should be evaluated together. In difficult differential diagnostic settings, e.g. differentiation between reactive versus neoplastic atypia or difficult to access lesions in the upper urinary tract, additional fluorescence in situ hybridization of cytological preparations might be helpful.

This article gives an overview of the currently available options and the clinical approach to the diagnostics and therapy of acute leukemia. The standardization as well as improvements in diagnostic procedures, in particular by immunocytological and genetic procedures, allow a more rapid determination of the exact diagnosis. In addition to age and performance status of patients, an established panel of cytogenetic and molecular markers allows an individual risk stratification for selecting the most appropriate therapeutic procedure for each patient. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger patients with genetically determined intermediate and poor risk status benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation whereas patients in the low risk group are still primarily treated with conventional induction chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine. The poor prognosis of elderly patients with AML has been improved by the development of stem cell transplantation procedures with reduced intensity conditioning and for patients not suitable for stem cell transplantation, the introduction of less toxic demethylating substances allows a substantial improvement in outcome and quality of life compared to cytoreductive therapy alone. The additional role of targeted therapies in AML is still under investigation. In adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the standard systemic therapy still consists of complex cytotoxic regimens which have been modified from pediatric protocols. Biologically and genetically determined subgroups of ALL patients as well as poor responders, who can be identified by the detection of significant molecular determined residual disease (MRD) after standard therapy, benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first remission. In patients with bcr-abl positive ALL, the implementation of first and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to rapidly rising response rates and less toxicity. Patients with relapsed ALL may benefit from new molecular options, e.g. bispecific antibodies. Additionally, improved standardization and supportive care, particularly due to the introduction of modern antimycotic agents, increase the treatment options and improve the prognosis of patients with acute leukemia. The improved diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with acute leukemia require a complex management. Currently only subgroups of patients benefit from molecular targeted therapeutic strategies. Due to this increasing complexity in the management, patients with acute leukemia should be treated in academic centers and within clinical trials.

To what extent can pathologists contribute to the diagnostics of LSD? In material collected from LSD, morphological storage phenomena in some disease forms, particularly in histiocytic cells from bone marrow smears and some tissues are highlighted, presented and described. Due to the multitude and heterogeneity of LSDs this list is by no means exhaustive. In Gaucher disease, the forms of Niemann-Pick disease, cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), GM1 gangliosidosis and other LSDs, the histiocytic storage cells seen, for example, in bone marrow smears can be finely and ultrastructurally differentiated. Thereby, not only the presence of an LSD in general but also some individual types of LSD can be identified, even though preliminarily. To confirm the diagnosis the genetic and sometimes biochemical analysis of blood samples or fibroblast cultures from patients is usually required. The pathologist may be the first to suspect LSD and this applies to LSDs that show storage histiocytes or one of a number of other LSDs in which only minor or absent storage is seen in histiocytes but marked storage phenomena are found in other cell systems. Some of the numerous, extremely heterogeneous LSDs may, however, be overlooked as detailed knowledge of the generally rare LSDs is the domain of LSD specialists. Clinicians, pathologists, geneticists and biochemists should cooperate in solving the diagnostic problems.

Recent findings have shown that blood monocytes are not just transient forms involved in the recruitment of macrophages but that different dendritic and monocytic subpopulations can be observed in blood. In tissue, self-renewing macrophages derived from the yolk sac as well as monocyte-derived dendritic cells and monocyte-derived macrophages can be distinguished. Due to their plasticity and polarization, under inflammatory conditions monocyte-derived macrophages may be beneficial for the reestablishment of homeostasis or may contribute to mostly chronic diseases.

These include histiocytic sarcomas, follicular dendritic cell sarcomas, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcomas, fibroblastic reticulum cell tumors\/cytokeratin-positive interstitial cell neoplasms and neoplasms of indeterminate dendritic cells. A feature common to all of these tumors is the very difficult differential diagnosis, not least because of their rarity; however, a careful analysis will allow discrimination from other sarcomas, sarcomatoid carcinomas, lymphomas and melanomas and lead to the correct classification of the respective lesions. From the pathogenetic view point it is interesting that there is an increased association of these tumors with lymphomas and leukemias. Moreover, many cases demonstrate shared clonal antigen receptor rearrangements and\/or recurrent genetic aberrations in both histologically different tumor components. This suggests a common precursor cell or at least a common derivation. ","860":"A 72-year-old male patient presented with multiple erythematous plaques on the lower arms, lower legs and feet. The patient suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and accompanying interstitial granulomatous dermatitis under treatment with tocilizumab. Several months prior to presentation a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) had been diagnosed. The skin biopsy showed a perivascular infiltration of medium-sized cells with positivity for CD123, CD303 and CD4 with a low proliferation activity so that a diagnosis of a CMML-associated proliferation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was made. The differential diagnosis of specific cutaneous infiltrates in CMML is discussed.

Currently, both these forms cannot be morphologically distinguished. In the lungs a nodular proliferation of Langerhans cells occurs in the bronchial mucosa and also peripherally in the alveolar septa with an accompanying infiltration by eosinophilic granulocytes and destruction of the bronchial wall. Langerhans cells can be selectively detected with antibodies against CD1a and langerin. In the reactive isolated pulmonary form, abstinence from tobacco smoking in most patients leads to regression of infiltration and improvement of symptoms. In high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) the small star-like scars can still be detected even after complete cessation of tobacco smoking.","864":"Macrophages are important factors in the pathogenesis and prognosis of malignant tumors and represent a possible target for therapeutic intervention. Depending on the tumor entity and the prevalent polarization status, macrophages can be associated with a favorable or unfavorable clinical outcome. It is becoming clear, however, that the conventional definitions of M1 polarized tumor inhibitory and M2 polarized tumor promoting macrophages do not adequately reflect the heterogeneity and plasticity of macrophages. Macrophages can support tumor growth through direct interactions with the neoplastic cells, by promoting tissue remodeling and angiogenesis and by inhibiting local immune reactions. To achieve comparability of clinical studies, it will be necessary to reach a consensus nomenclature of macrophage polarization. Furthermore, methods for the quantitative characterization of macrophage populations in malignant tumors will have to be standardized. It is unlikely that single marker immunohistochemistry will be adequate in this context. In any case it is necessary to provide unequivocal information regarding the markers or marker combinations used. ","865":"Information obtained from the autopsies of children, neonates, fetuses and embryos, may not only be useful to explain the loss experienced by the parents but also to estimate the risk of recurrence. The detection of diseases by an autopsy helps to reduce the risk as well as with the planning of the next pregnancy and the optimal care of mother and fetus. Although incidences are continually dropping, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics each year at least 2.6 million children worldwide suffer intrauterine death after the 28th week of pregnancy. Despite a general decrease in the number of autopsies, the parents agreed to a post-mortem examination in 500 out of 512 cases. The post-mortem examination and interpretation of results of children differ from those obtained from adults. As a supplement to previous publications, this article discusses these differences and may provide standardized instructions on performing autopsies and evaluation of autopsy findings.

Part 1 of this CME article dealt with macroscopic findings in eyeglobes, in order to facilitate adequate cutting planes to retrieve pathologies histologically. Part 2 which is presented here teaches basic histology of eye-specific tissues (e.g., cornea, anterior chamber angle, retina, and optic nerve). Theses structures show typical changes in blinded eyes. Knowledge of these changes, together with awareness of fundamental ophthalmic disease entities and surgical strategies (see part 1), will many times allow to deduce the pathophysiology that finally culminated in blindness and enucleation. Disease entities more closely discussed in this article include corneal ulcers, rubeotic secondary glaucomas, and chronic degenerative retinal diseases.","868":"Deep-seated lipomatous tumors of the peripheral soft tissue of the extremities are uncommon. The majority represent atypical lipomatous tumors or well-differentiated liposarcomas. On rare occasions benign adipocytic tumors, such as hibernoma may present as huge, deep-lying subfascial masses. As a consequence of the deep location and usually heterogeneous signal intensities in imaging, they are particularly at risk to be misinterpreted as liposarcomas on clinical grounds. Furthermore, the rarity and thus limited familiarity with the morphological appearance and spectrum still represent a pitfall for the histopathological assessment. ","869":"Cardiac paragangliomas are extremely rare neoplasms with an incidence of 1% of all cardiac tumors and can be completely asymptomatic, therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This article reports the case of an 18-year-old man with a heart murmur detected during a routine physical examination. Echocardiography revealed a heart tumor measuring 7 cm in size in the right atrium. Due to the tumor size and the threat of tricuspid valve insufficiency, tumor resection was performed. The histopathological examination revealed a cardiac paraganglioma with positive reactions of the tumor cells for chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56. Differentiating a primary cardiac paraganglioma from other more common cardiac tumors and particularly from metastases of neuroendocrine neoplasms from other locations is essential not only for the further clinical treatment but also for the prognosis of the patient.","870":"The goal of evaluation of intraoperative frozen sections of the thyroid gland is to achieve a definitive diagnosis which determines the subsequent surgical management as fast as possible; however, due to the specific methodological situation of thyroid frozen sections evaluation a conclusive diagnosis can be made in only some of the cases. If no conclusive histological diagnosis is possible during the operation, subsequent privileged processing of the specimen allows a final diagnosis at the latest within 48 h in almost all remaining cases. Applying this strategy, both pathologists and surgeons require a high level of communication and knowledge regarding the specific diagnostic and therapeutic peculiarities of thyroid malignancies because different surgical strategies must be employed depending on the histological tumor subtype.","871":null,"872":"","873":"","874":"","875":null,"876":"Epithelial neuroendocrine tumors of the upper respiratory tract are rare and are classified as typical and atypical carcinoid versus small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Competent interpretation of the macroscopic findings is crucial to identify adequate cutting planes for histology. Anatomic landmarks on the globe's exterior and common section planes are described. Diseases that typically lead to enucleation will be explained in detail and illustrated with images. In the second part of this article, a histologic description of eye-specific tissue types is provided. ","879":"Pituitary adenomas have to be studied in detail for structural characteristics, especially regarding the degree of granulation and immunohistochemical hormone expression, such as growth hormone (GH), prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and proliferation markers (e.g. Ki-67 and p53) for correlation to clinical data and assessment of the prognosis. If histological and immunostaining data do not correlate to the patient data, explanations for the discrepancies must be found. All active adenoma types can also be present as inactive, so-called silent adenomas showing the same features. An increased Ki-67 index (&gt; 3%), significant nuclear expression of protein p53 and mitoses are characteristic of atypical adenomas. Up to now the biological relevance of these atypical adenomas, especially their role as preneoplasms for pituitary carcinomas has not been fully elucidated. The only proof of a pituitary carcinoma is the existence of metastases. Extensive local invasion and a greatly increased Ki-67 index are not sufficient for this diagnosis. Craniopharyngiomas have to be classified into adamantinomatous types (intrasellar and suprasellar) and papillary types (only suprasellar). Regressive changes are found in adamantinomatous types only. Strong regression may lead to difficulties in the differential diagnosis of Rathke's cleft cysts with squamous metaplasia. Demonstration of nuclear expression of beta-catenin in these cases enables the diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Papillary craniopharyngiomas are characterized by BRAF mutations that may be helpful in the differential diagnosis. All pituicytomas of the neurohypophysis, all spindle cell oncocytomas of the anterior pituitary and all granular cell tumors of the posterior pituitary express thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and are thought to be variants of a common uniform spindle cell tumor of the pituitary.","880":"The classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) of the gastrointestinal tract and also the pancreas is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification from 2010, the site-related TNM stage classification and the clinicopathological characterization.

A differentiation from reactive hyperplastic alterations with a possible invasiveness in samples taken from the surface of the special type of well-differentiated verrucous squamous cell carcinoma can be difficult. This pitfall of such a tumor is presented in the case described here with corresponding diagnostic difficulties. ","883":"In daily routine pathology of the adrenal glands three tumor entities are important: adrenocortical tumors, adrenomedullary tumors and metastases. The differentiation of these three main tumor types can often be difficult structurally but immunostaining enables a definite diagnosis in nearly all cases. Adrenocortical tumors are positive for steroidogenic factor 1 and melan-A and always negative for chromogranin A whereas adrenomedullary tumors express chromogranin A but never keratin. A broad spectrum of antibodies is available for the identification of metastases and even the rare epithelioid angiosarcomas. For adrenocortical tumors, adenomas and carcinomas can be differentiated using three scoring systems and the Ki-67 index in adenomas should not exceed 3%. Using scoring systems and the Ki-67 index approximately 90% of cortical tumors can be differentiated into benign or malignant tumors. For pheochromocytomas two scoring systems are used for differentiating benign and malignant tumors but the results are less dependable.","884":"All tumours with C cell differentiation are designated as medullary carcinomas (MTC). MTC occur sporadically (75-80%) or hereditary (20-25%), the latter being part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Familial MTC, which is commonly preceded by \"neoplastic\" C cell hyperplasia, is caused by autosomal-dominant inherited germ line mutation of the RET-protooncogene; dependent on the codon affected by the mutation, patients show substantially different clinical courses. Due to its morphological heterogeneity, the immunohistochemical demonstration of calcitonin is mandatory for the diagnosis of MTC. For early diagnosis of MTC calcitonin screening has been introduced in Germany and Austria approx. 10 years ago in patients with thyroid nodules; however, an increased calcitonin serum level may also be caused by \"non-MEN2-associated\" C cell, which is not regarded as a precursor of sporadic MTC. Very rarely tumours may show a mixed C cell-follicular cell differentiation.","885":"The C cells (parafollicular) of the human thyroid gland are predominantly located within the thyroid follicles, are of neuroendocrine origin and produce and secrete the peptide hormone calcitonin. Calcitonin is clinically utilized as a screening marker to detect occult medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as well as in the follow-up of patients with MTC. An increase in the number of C cells is designated as C cell hyperplasia (CCH). Neoplastic CCH is caused by an autosomal dominant inherited mutation of the RET protooncogene, which develops into invasive familial MTC in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 depending on the location of the mutation in the RET gene with a high variation in latency. According to the current state of knowledge CCH without a germline mutation in the RET protooncogene, designated as non-MEN2-associated CCH, seems to be unrelated to the development of sporadic MTC.

Prognostic biomarkers in CRC are the MSI-status and the mutational status of BRAF. According to the current WHO classification poorly and undifferentiated CRC and MSI-associated special morphological subtypes are molecular graded depending on their MSI-status.

Whereas the former used a chiefly macroscopic approach to an academic classification, the concepts of the latter were based on microscopic observations. In contrast to pathologists, who in the nineteenth century were dominated by Virchow and his teachings, dermatologists as well as microscopically active gynecologists already applied histological findings for diagnostics and subsequent therapy. Chapters dealing with diseases of the skin in multivolume handbooks of pathology were initially mainly written by dermatologists.

Correlation of the histological features of spitzoid neoplasms with molecular genetic aberrations. A review and summary of the scientific literature. Several histopathological and molecular genetic distinct subtypes of spitzoid lesions have been defined. Epithelioid Spitz tumors commonly show a loss of the BAP1 gene and BRAF mutations and are associated with a hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome. Desmoplastic Spitz tumors frequently harbor HRAS mutations and gains of the chromosome arm 11p. Plexiform Spitz tumors often display ALK translocations. The morphology of Spitz tumors with ROS1, NTRK1, RET and BRAF fusion genes seems to be unspecific and is currently not well characterized. Morphological features offer valuable clues to the underlying genetic aberrations in spitzoid neoplasms. Genetic aberrations can be found in the entire biological spectrum of spitzoid neoplasms (i.e. Spitz nevi, atypical Spitz tumors and spitzoid melanoma) and are, therefore, probably not useful for distinguishing benign from malignant tumors; however, genetic aberrations represent important targets for therapeutic interventions and offer investigational treatment options for patients with metastatic disease. The appearance of multiple epithelioid melanocytic tumors with BAP1 loss indicates a hereditary tumor syndrome and warrants genetic counseling and preventive screening of affected individuals.

In this review published paleopathological findings and artificial alterations as well as suggestions regarding underlying diseases were characterized. A selective search of the literature was carried out in the PubMed data base in an arbitrary time interval from 1960 to 2013 (search terms: Tutankhamun, Pharaoh, paleopathology and mummy) and additional supplementary literature. Many artificial changes were a result of embalming and the examinations which have been performed since exhumation in 1922. Evidenced pathologies are craniofacial dysmorphia, bilateral alterations of the feet, malarial disease and an acute traumatic fracture of the knee. The cause of the knee fracture could no longer be reconstructed. Other trauma (e.g. skull fractures) or familial transmission of an eighteenth dynasty syndrome could not be confirmed. In addition to many artificial post-mortem alterations, chronic and acute diseases could be verified in Tutankhamun, although the underlying causes are partially unknown.

The biological behavior (common nevus variant or precursor of melanoma?) is difficult to evaluate by presently available methods.

Melanoma is a malignant melanocytic tumor and the risk for metastasis and associated mortality is mainly dependent on tumor thickness and depth of invasion. Early recognition and correct diagnosis is therefore important for successful and effective treatment. The correct diagnosis of melanoma is, however, challenging due to the wide morphological spectrum. Historically, the disease was subdivided into superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna and acral lentiginous melanoma but many more subtypes have subsequently been added. Some of these melanoma variants also show differences relating to the genetic background, clinical presentation, prognosis and treatment and may be associated with a specific differential diagnosis.

The demonstration of a monoclonal B-cell population by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization or PCR excludes a benign lymphatic lesion. In the differential diagnosis with other small B-cell lymphomas in the stomach, a panel of five different immunohistochemical markers is useful to diagnose a small lymphocytic lymphoma (CD5 and CD23 positive), a mantle cell lymphoma (CD5 and cyclin D1 positive) or a follicular lymphoma (BCL2 and CD10 positive).

In addition three rare forms of carcinoma were considered as emerging or provisional entities: thyroid-like follicular RCC, succinate dehydrogenase B deficiency-associated RCC and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation RCC. In the new ISUP Vancouver classification, modifications to the existing 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) specifications are also suggested. Tumor morphology, a differentiation between sarcomatoid and rhabdoid and tumor necrosis were emphasized as being significant prognostic parameters for RCC. The consensus ISUP grading system assigns clear cell and papillary RCCs to grades 1-3 due to nucleolar prominence and grade 4 is reserved for cases with extreme nuclear pleomorphism, sarcomatoid and\/or rhabdoid differentiation. Furthermore, consensus guidelines were established for the preparation of samples. For example, agreement was also reached that renal sinus invasion is diagnosed when the tumor is in direct contact with the fatty tissue or loose connective tissue of the sinus (intrarenal peripelvic fat) or when endothelialized cavities within the renal sinus are invaded by the tumor, independent of the size.

This fibrogenesis is the result of a complex pathogenesis, which can be investigated in animal models but also in situ to harvest new biomarkers. This article deals particularly with the second method and summarizes molecular pathological findings in various model diseases for aberrant reparative tissue reconstruction. These model diseases include plexiform vasculopathy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), Quilty lesions in heart transplantation, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), inflammatory airway remodeling and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induced smooth muscle proliferation (posttransplantation smooth muscle tumor, PTSMT).Using in situ molecular pathology, we were able to dismiss an assumed involvement of myofibroblastic cells in vessel reconstruction of the lung in PAH. We could also for the first time perform a comprehensive molecular characterization of the vascular remodeling and prove that plexiform vasculopathy represents a complex-regulated epiphenomenon of excessive pulmonary hypertension. This method also allowed us to describe for the first time the miRNA expression in PAH in a compartment-specific manner and to draw conclusions regarding the damaged overriding regulatory mechanisms. In the same way, we were also able to describe the chimeric character of the complex neoangiogenesis in the donor organ after heart transplantation.After lung transplantation, we identified for the first time a group of tissue-based molecular markers, which can predict later occurrence of BO even in morphologically normal transbronchial biopsies. In addition, we have documented for the first time the molecular characteristics of the morphologically analogous airway reconstruction in lung-transplanted and non-transplanted patients. We could further elucidate the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their antagonists in inflammatory airway reconstruction and deduce from this the resulting therapeutic implications. Accordingly, we were able to further clarify the origin, pathogenesis and the malignant potential of EBV-induced PTSMT and for the first time provide an evidence-based therapy recommendation and risk assessment.In summary, this article documents that in situ diagnostics can meet the requirements of the challenging parameters and issues of life sciences.

Although the number of entities is limited there exist very different clinical and radiological images depending on the manifestation in the different regions of the skeleton. Bone tumors are also histologically structured very differently even within a particular entity. Prior to the histopathological diagnosis the location of the lesion within the entire skeleton and in relation to the tumor-bearing bone must be clarified based on imaging findings, i.e. which bone is affected, which portion of the bone is affected and is the tumor centrally located in the marrow cavity, in the area of the corticalis or on the outside? It is known that bone tumors show diagnostically relevant preferential locations in both the total skeleton as well as within the affected bone depending on the entity and that the age of onset also varies. In this article the most common reasons for errors in assessment are discussed. In most cases it is possible for reference pathology to still correctly classify specific cases by a consistent consideration of diagnostic radiology in combination with morphology. Although diagnostic progress for specific entities of bone tumors has been achieved using molecular methods, the established principle of interdisciplinary cooperation is the prerequisite for the correct diagnosis of these tumors.

It appears that cytogenetic aberrations are not randomly found in this tumor group. Loss of chromosomal material (e.g. 1p, 3p, 10q, 13q and 14q) is more frequently found than gain of material (e.g. 7q, especially 7q33). Several studies demonstrated brachyury expression (T; 6q27) as a possible candidate gene in the oncogenesis of chordomas (e.g. knock down in the chordoma cell line U-CH1).

Patients with benign tumors usually undergo surgical treatment in cases of local symptoms, mainly consisting of pain or functional deficits due to compression of important anatomical structures, such as nerves or blood vessels. Locally\/aggressive and rarely metastasizing tumors exhibit an infiltrative growth pattern, so that surgical treatment is necessary to prevent further destruction of bone leading to local instability. Finally, the surgical treatment of malignant tumors is, with few exceptions, considered to be a prerequisite for long-term survival, either alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy. Whereas the main objective of surgery in the treatment of benign tumors is relief of local symptoms with a minimum amount of damage to healthy tissue and minimizing the risk of local recurrence while ensuring bone stability in locally aggressive and rarely metastasizing tumors, the primary goal in the operative treatment of bone sarcomas is the resection of the tumor with clear surgical margins followed by defect reconstruction and the preservation of function. This review examines the current developments in the surgical treatment of primary bone neoplasms with respect to the management of the tumors and novel reconstructive options. ","932":"The diagnosis of infections in patients with arthritis and\/or in joint prostheses requires interdisciplinary cooperation and the application of up-to-date methods. The histological investigation of the synovial membrane allows the differentiation of acute, chronic and granulomatous synovialitis. Detection of conserved regions of the microbial genome by PCR, especially 16S rRNA for bacteria and 18S rRNA for fungi, is a broad approach for the classification of pathogens which cannot be cultured. Acute infectious arthritis and periprosthetic infections share the spectrum of pathogens with sepsis, therefore multiplex PCR-based methods for the detection of sepsis can be employed. Molecular diagnostics can detect minimal infections in periprosthetic tissues even after antibiotic therapy. The anamnesis (enteral or urogenital infection), clinical picture (oligoarthritis) and further parameters (e.g. HLA B27 status) are important for the diagnosis of reactive arthritis. In many cases of reactive arthritis, molecular methods allow the detection of bacterial DNA or RNA in synovial fluid or tissue samples. The low sensitivity of histopathological methods may be compensated by application of PCR techniques, especially in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous synovitis including mycobacterial infections. Molecular methods can be used to support the differential diagnosis of septic and reactive arthritis. MicroRNA techniques combined with PCR for detection of pathogens support the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis with severe inflammatory activity compared to infectious arthritis. Proteomic methods could expand the methodological spectrum for the diagnosis of infections.

Such classic lesions include Kaposi sarcoma, inflammatory fibroid polyp, sclerosing mesenteritis and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor but, more recently, the recognition of IgG4-related fibrosclerosing disease has resulted in modification of the views on pathogenesis and treatment of such inflammatory lesions in many anatomical sites. In some lesions the inflammation may reflect viral influences (Kaposi sarcoma) or a bacterial infectious trigger (IgG4-related fibrosclerosing disease) whereas in others such an interaction is unclear and alterations in various genes have been detected, such as anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene rearrangements in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene mutations in inflammatory fibroid polyp and some gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Even the inflammatory milieu of GISTs may have an impact on the outcome. This article discusses the practical diagnostic considerations as well as the theoretical background. ","934":"The gastric mucosa and its glands represent a close interactive barrier to the outside world. This delicate surface is protected by a multilayered mucus barrier which contains among others the mucins MUC5AC and MUC6 and the trefoil factor family peptide TFF2. Furthermore, two types of gastric glands form delicate homeostatic systems, i.e. the fundic and antral glands, which show continual bidirectional self-renewal via differentiation from stem and progenitor cells. It was the aim of this study to analyze the self-renewal of these gastric units. Three characteristic regions (i.e. foveolar, proliferative zone and lower gland regions) were isolated from fundic and antral units by the use of laser microdissection and expression profiles concerning known marker genes were generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The surface mucous cells (SMCs) of fundic and antral units characteristically differed in the expression of certain secretory genes. Furthermore, the maturation of mucous neck cells and their trans-differentiation into chief cells as well as the maturation of antral SMCs and antral gland cells occurred in a stepwise manner. The correct maturation particularly of mucous neck cells and their trans-differentiation into chief cells is critical for homeostatic self-renewal of fundic units. Dysregulation of this multistep process can result in generation of the spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) lineage which is characterized by its strong ectopic TFF2 expression. Chronic inflammation is known to support SPEM formation. The SPEM lineage is a precancerous lesion which can further differentiate into intestinal metaplasia. ","935":"The differential diagnosis of soft tissue swellings encompasses a variety of benign, intermediate, low-grade malignant and high-grade neoplastic lesions in addition to tumor-like reactive processes. As treatment of these heterogeneous conditions varies greatly from conservative observation and simple local excision up to extensive radical surgical resection, treatment decisions are based mainly on a precise preoperative histological diagnosis on limited biopsy material. Even for clinically unequivocal sarcomas, the importance of the preoperative histological diagnosis has been increasingly emphasized as different therapeutic regimens have been established for different sarcoma types and the indications for preoperative treatment is influenced by the tumor grade and by the entity itself. Other factors positively influencing the increasing use of core needle biopsy for preoperative tumor diagnosis in soft tissue pathology are the availability of modern high-resolution imaging modalities as well as the establishment of several new second generation immunohistochemical markers and the discovery of entity-specific translocations detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in several sarcoma subtypes. In this review it will be shown that a targeted approach for processing core needle biopsies oriented towards the characteristic topographical, demographic, cytomorphological and architectural features of soft tissue lesions facilitates a precise diagnosis of soft tissue neoplasms in most cases. However, profound knowledge of the different aspects of soft tissue tumor diagnostics and familiarity with the frequent as well as the less common and rare tumor entities and variants is a prerequisite for appropriate interpretation of core needle biopsy findings and for selecting a limited but well-suited marker panel. The utilization of modern immunohistochemistry and\/or FISH methods is highly useful for establishing the diagnosis of rare and unusual neoplasms in core needle biopsies.

In this study a potential role of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase\/v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR) cascade was investigated in the regulation of MDM4 in HCC. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT and\/or mTOR pathways lowered MDM4 protein levels in HCC cells. Mechanistic protection from proteasomal degradation resulted from de-ubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific protease 2a and AKT-mediated phosphorylation of MDM4, thus increasing MDM4 protein levels. These findings were corroborated in a chimeric AKT mouse model. Upregulation of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling may result from overexpression of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 (EEF1A2). Finally, a strong association between the expression of EEF1A2, phosphorylated AKT and MDM4 was observed in human HCC samples. Strong activation of the EEF1A2\/PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR\/MDM4 signaling pathway was observed in HCC patients with short survival suggesting that targeting this axis might be a promising approach in a subset of HCC patients.","938":"","939":null,"940":"The diagnostics of pulmonary neoplasms has considerably changed in recent years.

The prognosis depends on the underlying cause. The fibrotic disorders show a set of radiological and histopathological patterns that are distinct but not entirely specific. In the absence of a clear clinical picture and consistent high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings, patients are advised to undergo surgical lung biopsies from two or three lung lobes (or transbronchial biopsies) to determine the histopathological pattern. The ILDs are differentiated into disorders of known causes (e.g. collagen vascular disease, drug-related), idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), granulomatous ILDs (e.g. sarcoidosis) and other forms of ILD (e.g. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis). The IIPs encompass idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), non-specific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease, cryptogen organizing pneumonia, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia and acute interstitial pneumonia. Additionally, a category of unclassified interstitial pneumonia exists. The pathologist has to recognize and address the histopathological pattern. In a multidisciplinary discussion the disorder is allocated to a clinicopathological entity and the histopathological pattern plays a major role in the classification of the entity.

These interventions involve removal of a previously implanted prosthesis which has resulted in complaints and replacement with a new prosthesis. There are manifold reasons for revision surgery, the most common indication being so-called endoprosthesis loosening, which is subdivided into septic and aseptic loosening. Histomorphological studies revealed that periprosthetic tissue from endoprosthesis loosening can be classified into four types (I) wear-particle induced type, (II) infectious type, (III) combined type and (IV) fibrous type. Types I and IV represent aseptic loosening and types II and III septic loosening. Recently, the topic of implant allergy has emerged. The detection of cellular, mostly perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates is discussed as being a sign of an allergic tissue reaction. It has most frequently been observed in type I periprosthetic membranes with a dense load of metal wear, which occurs with metal-on-metal bearings.

These tumors have been termed apocrine poromas. Multilineage differentiation within a poroma can be explained by the embryological association of the sweat duct with the so-called folliculo-sebaceous-apocrine unit. The clinical and histopathological features of apocrine poromas are reviewed in comparison to classical eccrine poromas by taking into account seven own cases of apocrine poroma and a review of the literature. It is important for histopathologists not to confuse apocrine poroma with other tumors with multilineage differentiation. Apocrine poroma needs to be distinguished from sebaceoma and from basal cell carcinoma with sebaceous differentiation, in particular, because these tumors have therapeutic consequences for the patient.

In contrast to reactive mesothelial cells cells of MMs often harbor chromosomal aberrations, most frequently a polysomy in combination with a 9p21 deletion. These chromosomal aberrations can easily be detected by multitarget fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); therefore, FISH allows a reliable distinction between reactive mesothelial cells and MM cells. In order to be able to discriminate between MM and adenocarcinoma, an immunocytochemical panel consisting of different mesothelial and epithelial markers is very helpful.

Some of the blood vessels showed evidence of vasculitis. After further clinical and serological investigations with highly elevated levels of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) and antiproteinase-3 antibodies, a rare limited disease of granulomatous polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) was finally diagnosed. Such a manifestation of the disease is exceedingly rare; therefore, only single case reports have so far been described.

Due to the presence of tumefactive mixed inflammatory infiltrates with variable involvement of surrounding soft tissues, this benign condition is often mistaken for a malignancy on clinical examination. In the salivary glands xanthogranulomatous inflammation is rare and mainly represents reactive changes secondary to a preexisting lesion, in particular infarcted Warthin tumors as well as ruptured ductal cysts and other sialectatic ductal changes. A special type of xanthogranulomatous salivary gland disease is represented by the rare primary (idiopathic) xanthogranulomatous sialadenitis without identifiable predisposing parenchymal or ductal lesions. The histological differential diagnosis is mainly based on the dominant histological pattern and encompasses among others inflammatory pseudotumors of various etiologies (e.g. inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, IgG4-related disease and sarcoidosis), neoplastic and paraneoplastic xanthogranulomatosis, malignant lymphoma and carcinoma with secondary xanthogranulomatous reactions.

This disorder is characterized by unifocal or multifocal (multiorgan) involvement by tumefactive plasma cell-rich inflammatory infiltrates associated with prominent fibrosclerosis. This not uncommonly interferes with organ function resulting in diverse clinical symptoms. The autoimmune pancreatitis represents the prototype of this disease; however, to date almost all organs have been reported to be involved in this disorder. In the head and neck area several presentations of this disease may be encountered in salivary glands, lacrimal glands, thyroid gland, lymph nodes, soft tissue of the neck, ear and sinonasal tract. However, IgG4 positive plasma cells are occasionally prominent in non-specific chronic inflammatory conditions of the head and neck and the oral cavity unrelated to autoimmune diseases or systemic disorders, thus representing diagnostic pitfalls.

This nowadays mainly comprises non-keratinizing oropharyngeal carcinomas frequently associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) and non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinomas mostly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The term lymphoepithelioma was originally defined by A. Schmincke and J. Ewing as a combined clinical and histological tumor entity of lymphoepithelial organs. The main reason for the longstanding terminological confusion regarding the term lymphoepithelioma is based on the fact that lateron a pure histological interpretation (lymphoepithelial differentiation) caused an artificial and nonreproducible exclusion of tumors with transitional and basaloid differentiation. For the forthcoming new WHO classification it has been suggested that squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck should no longer be classified according to the heterogeneous histological differentiation but according to etiopathogenetic criteria (e.g. HPV-related, EBV-related, nicotine and alcohol-related). This proposed classification corresponds much better to the prognosis and therapy and would represent a late acknowledgement of Schmincke's visionary concept of a clinically and histomorphologically defined tumor entity. In addition, the ongoing terminological confusion over the heterogeneous and prognostically weak spectrum of histological differentiation would subside.","1008":"Carcinomas of the oropharynx with association to high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified as a new tumour entity with favourable prognosis, distinct from classical nicotine- and alcohol-associated carcinoma. They develop through oncogenic transformation of the basal cells of reticulated cryptal epithelium of the palatinal tonsils and the base of the tongue. Positivity for HPV strongly correlates with an atypical, non-keratinizing histological differentiation and cystic transformation of lymph node metastases. Strong immunohistological positivity for p16 reliably detects transcriptionally active infection with high-risk HPV. Hence, p16 staining has been regarded as an effectual diagnostic tool in the appropriate setting. Frequent nodal metastasation as well as considerable size of (cystic) metastases, and frequent small size as well as submucosal location of primary tumours all contribute to frequent initial manifestation of cervical cancer of unknown primary (CUP). In a situation of CUP diagnostic testing for HPV (in negative cases in addition to EBV) is recommended in lymph node metastases, due to the high predictive value for the localization of occult primary carcinomas.

Rare pleomorphic or florid variants of LCIS must be differentiated from classical LCIS. The classical type of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) can be distinguished from the non-special type of invasive breast cancer (NST) by E-cadherin inactivation, loss of E-cadherin related cell adhesion and the subsequent discohesive growth pattern.

Although there is no standardized approach with regard to which area of a histological section and how many cells should be counted in a quantitative or semiquantitative fashion as well as to the threshold, Ki-67 is broadly applied in breast pathology. This can be explained by the good reproducibility of the degree of proliferation assessed by Ki-67, at least in the low and high ranges, the possibility to substantiate grading and better practicability in core biopsies in comparison to mitotic counting. In neoadjuvant therapy of hormone receptor positive breast cancer, Ki-67 can probably predict the efficacy of pure hormone receptor blockade without chemotherapy.

Adherence to different diagnostic criteria for microscopic margin involvement and divergent terminology for the various margins of pancreatoduodenectomy specimens add to the confusion. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that the dissection technique and extent of tissue sampling influence the accuracy of margin assessment. Axial specimen slicing, extensive tissue sampling, and multicolored margin inking result in a significantly higher, more accurate R1 rate than when using traditional grossing techniques.

Using genome-wide approaches we identified a large number of c-MYC target genes. Subsequently, we characterized some target genes for their role in c-MYC-induced genomic instability and immortalization. The protein deacetylase SIRT1 was found to be an important mediator of c-MYC-induced immortalization.

Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSC) can differentiate in three-dimensional collagen gels into functional osteoblasts when subjected to a phosphate-rich cultivation medium. Furthermore, they acquire a prosynthetic, matrix remodeling, contractile phenotype. Medial artery calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease also proceeds through intramembranous ossification resulting from osteoblast-induced calcification of the collagen extracellular matrix. Thus, the influence of uremic cultivation conditions as a pathophysiological stimulus on MSC and endothelial cells was analyzed with special regards to matrix remodeling, vascularization and calcification. The results showed that BMP-2\/4 mediated MSC (mal)differentiation into osteoblasts with acquired matrix remodeling phenotype and loss of proangiogenic capacity.

","1096":"Recognition of the differential diagnosis between lymphadenitis and malignant lymphoma requires good knowledge of the basic forms of the disease as well in depth knowledge of the structure of the individual compartments. There are defined forms of lymphadenitis where the differential diagnosis to certain lymphoma entities is known. Other reactive structural alterations show indistinct limits so that a decision is only possible after using additional techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses. Finally, there are marginal areas which can only be clarified by including clinical data.","1097":null,"1098":"","1099":"","1100":"Differentiation of chronic gastritis from marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZoL) of MALT type is often difficult for the pathologist. Diagnostic tools include CD20 stain to highlight lymphoepithelial lesions, Wotherspoon grading of the infiltrate, and clonality analysis of the B-cells. MZoL may partially transform into a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma, which the authors have named blastic MZoL. Blastic MZoL may be present with or without small cell MZoL. Without this component, blastic MzoL, while being CD10-negative, is presently difficult to positively diagnose since specific immune markers are still lacking. Blastic MZoL has a very favourable outcome compared to conventional diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Moreover, there are conventional DLBCL in the stomach, mostly in a setting of a secondary organ involvement. The biology of these gastric DLBCL is identical to their extragastric counterparts. This is also true for primary gastric Burkitt lymphoma and mucosal involvement in B-CLL or mantle cell lymphoma. Unfavourable outcomes are always observed for EBV-triggered lymphoproliferations in immunodeficiency and peripheral T-cell lymphomas which might also arise or be initially diagnosed in the stomach.","1101":"Mycosis fungoides is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with protracted clinical course and progression in different stages with increasing aggressiveness. The clinical picture as well as the histopathology of mycosis fungoides within the early patch and plaque phase is difficult to delineate from some inflammatory skin diseases. Thus, the diagnosis of these early stages of the lymphoma is only possible when clinical, histopathological, and molecular features are integrated into the diagnosis, especially as none of the individual disease criteria is specific. Important clues towards the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides are cytologically abnormal epidermotropic CD4-positive T-cells causing only minor epidermal alterations, the formation of Pautrier-abscesses and basal alignment of the epidermotropic T-cells. The findings of an aberrant T-cell immunophenotype of the intraepidermal lymphoid component as well as the molecular proof of T-cell clonality are important further features. In the differential diagnosis between early stage mycosis fungoides and parapsoriasis, there remains nevertheless a diagnostic and maybe also a true biological grey zone.","1102":null,"1103":null,"1104":"","1105":"Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The histological patterns of NLPHL variants are characterized by different localizations of the tumor cells, intranodular and perinodular and by the varying composition of the microenvironment. T-cell\/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma may be the result of an aggressive transformation of NLPHL. Classical lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma can usually be clearly distinguished from NLPHL by the immunophenotype of the tumor cells. Further differential diagnoses include follicular lymphoma and the follicular variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with CD20-positive blasts represents a differential diagnosis to the diffuse variants of NLPHL.","1106":"Grey zone lymphomas are lymphatic tumors that cannot be assigned to a defined lymphoma entity due to morphological, clinical or genetic reasons. As a defining criterion they present with features of two overlapping entities or features that are intermediate. Such lymphomas may represent a grey zone in the differentiation between indolent and aggressive lymphomas. Often they may show morphological features of one entity but be more related to another entity with respect to the immunophenotype and\/or genetic constitution, such as lymphomas in the grey zone between primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and primary nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The B-cell lymphoma, unclassified, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma has recently been recognized as a provisional category in the updated WHO 2008 classification of malignant lymphomas. This corresponds to a practical lymphoma category that obviously contains several entities with a Burkitt-like appearance and aggressive clinical behavior. Genetically, tumors in this category are frequently characterized by an atypical MYC translocation and complex karyotypic alterations. As yet, no adequate therapy concept exists.","1107":"Esophageal duplications are congenital abnormalities of the foregut. We present the case of a 33-year-old woman suffering from progressive dysphagia who had surgery for esophageal duplication. The following three criteria define the cystic lesion: an intimate attachment to the esophageal wall, the presence of a smooth muscle coat and a mucosal lining consisting of squamous and\/or ciliated respiratory epithelium. Diverticula, bronchogenic cysts and cystic neoplasms have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Congenital cystic esophageal duplication is a rare cause of dysphagia in adulthood.","1108":"Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic, clinically and histologically defined, inflammatory condition of the esophagus. The histological hallmark of eosinophilic esophagitis is a relevant, often patchy infiltration of the esophageal mucosa with eosinophils. In a consensus report a threshold value of approximately 120 eosinophils per mm(2) was arbitrarily fixed as a diagnostic criterion. Noteworthy for the quantification of the eosinophilic infiltration are several technical facts, for instance size and covering extent of the biopsy specimen of the high-power field (hpf) and quality of embedding of biopsy specimens have to be considered. In order to establish the histological diagnosis several additional abnormalities must be included in the assessment and gastrointestinal reflux disease is the main differential diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. Finally it is emphasized that for an affirmative diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, in addition to the histological findings the clinical facts must be included.","1109":null,"1110":null,"1111":"Plasma cell malignancies are tumors of terminally differentiated B-cells in which the neoplastic plasma cells are the dominant and proliferating tumor cell component. Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is one of the most common hematological neoplasms and typically does not cause diagnostic problems. A morphologically and immunophenotypically detectable plasmacellular orplasmablastic differentiation is, however, commonly observed in a wide range of mature B-cell lymphomas. A confident separation of the distinct entities requires the integration of clinical and morphological findings as well as an adequate phenotyping of both the plasma cell and the B-cell component if present. Detection of lymphotropic viruses, specific translocations and novel molecular markers, such as the MYD88 L265P mutation occurring in the vast majority of lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas complement our diagnostic repertoire. In this review we describe the most commonly observed diagnostic problems in separating small B-cell lymphomas from PCM and high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) with plasmablastic differentiation from extramedullary spread of aggressive PCM and provide helpful criteria for routine diagnostics.","1112":"The increasing use of immunohistochemical and molecular investigations of lymphatic tissues results in more frequent detection of early lymphoid proliferations. These show some but not all features of malignant lymphomas without fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy. In addition to well-known premalignant B-cell proliferations, such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), so-called in situ lymphomas have recently been described with minimal infiltrates of clonal B-cells in morphologically reactive lymphoid tissues which show the phenotypic and genetic features of specific B-cell lymphoma subtypes and often show a characteristic topographical distribution. This article addresses a group of clonal lymphoproliferations with usually localized disease and excellent clinical prognosis, such as pediatric follicular lymphoma and nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Another group of early lesions not addressed in this review are virally induced lymphoproliferations which represent a grey zone between purely reactive lesions and malignant lymphomas and may pose significant diagnostic as well as clinical problems. In this review diagnostic criteria for early or in situ lesions and their distinction from partial infiltration by malignant lymphoma are described.","1113":null,"1114":"Motility disorders of the esophagus comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of diseases. Primary malformations of the esophagus are now amenable to improved surgical and gastroenterological therapies; however, they often lead to persistent long-term esophageal dysmotility. Achalasia originates from impaired relaxation of the gastroesophageal sphincter apparatus. Systemic diseases may give rise to secondary disorders of esophageal motility. A number of visceral neuromuscular disorders show an esophageal manifestation but aganglionosis rarely extends into the esophagus. The growing group of myopathies includes metabolic and mitochondrial disorders with increasing levels of genetic characterization and incipient emergence of therapeutic strategies. Esophagitis with an infectious etiology causes severe dysmotility particularly in immunocompromised patients. Immunologically mediated inflammatory processes involving the esophagus are increasingly better understood. Finally, rare tumors and tumor-like lesions may impair esophageal motor function.","1115":"Maxillary ameloblastomas can extensively expand into the paranasal sinuses or even the nasal cavity due to a slow growth pattern. Sinusitis is rarely the first tumor-related complaint. Due to the various growth forms of ameloblastomas the challenging histological differential diagnosis includes several other odontogenic as well as benign and malignant non-odontogenic tumors, e.g. tumors from the mucosa of the paranasal sinuses, salivary glands and Rathke's pouch. Despite the radical surgical approach a complete resection with wide margins cannot always be achieved. Maxillary ameloblastomas show the highest recurrence rates. ","1116":"Whereas attention in the past has been focused on goblet cells as the primary marker for Barrett's esophagus (BE), the recent change in the definition now includes the non-goblet cell columnar cell-lined esophagus. In the present study the histological features of neoplasia of the lower esophagus and esophago-gastric junction in a German cohort were examined using immunohistochemical staining for MUC, CD10, intestinal and gastric type major tight junction proteins (claudins). Experimental studies using rat duodenogastric content reflux models have also been performed and data show that most neoplastic lesions of the esophageal glands in humans express gastric mucin phenotypes. Cardiac type mucosa was the main histological type in the surrounding mucosa of neoplastic lesions; however, most cardiac type mucosa has intestinal type tight junction proteins. BE with goblet cells has been reported to originate from stem cells located in the basal layer of esophageal squamous cell epithelium in previous models. However, the cardiac type mucosa seems to develop from the site of the stomach and not from the basal layer of esophageal squamous cell epithelium according to our model.","1117":"Esophageal malformations are rare and can occur sporadically or as a component of various syndromes. The variations and classifications are manifold. With the available modern operation techniques most malformations can be resolved with good results. However, esophageal malformations are often combined with further malformations which limit the prognosis. The separation of the trachea and esophagus after gastrulation is not yet completely researched. The results so far indicate that the localized expression of various homeodomain transcription factors is essential for normal development of the trachea and esophagus.","1118":"The definition of early carcinoma of the esophagus has changed with time on the basis of new data. As from 2007 an early carcinoma is defined as an intramucosal carcinoma with or without metastasis. In the subclassification based on invasion depth, m1 and m2 squamous cell carcinomas have no metastasis and are considered curable by endoscopic resection alone, whereas less than 10% of m3 carcinomas and some 20% of sm1 squamous cell carcinomas have lymph node metastasis. In this article the relationship between various histopathological findings and the incidence of lymph node metastasis is reviewed. The m3 and sm1 superficial squamous cell carcinomas showing 0-I and 0-III types, large tumors over 50 mm in size or those showing vessel permeation have higher incidences of lymph node metastasis. In the field of gastrointestinal surgical pathology pathologists are now expected to not only diagnose the presence or absence of malignancy but also to investigate in detail many of the histological factors related to the prevalence of lymph node metastasis.","1119":"","1120":"Lymphocytic esophagitis is a rare, ill-defined inflammatory disease of the esophagus and is characterized by an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Up to now no distinct clinical symptom or endoscopic finding could be linked to histopathological changes. Hence lymphocytic esophagitis remains a diagnosis by exclusion after ruling out other possible causes of esophageal intraepithelial lymphocytosis.","1121":"Even though pathologists are trained to recognize the same histological features for the diagnosis and grading of different histological images, not all pathologists are influenced to a similar level of intensity by the same morphological characteristics of the tissue when scoring Barrett's dysplasia\/neoplasia. The variables which most pathologists have intuitively chosen to use for scoring of the severity of Barrett's changes are mainly those related to the general tissue architecture, such as nuclear crowding, orientation and stratification. Interestingly, nuclear size is not used by most pathologists but nuclear pleomorphism and symmetry does influence a significant number of pathologists. Maybe the most difficult variables for the human eye to recognize are variables of chromatin texture (such as margination or heterogeneity), the predictive importance of which has been demonstrated in a previously published work. Textural variables may therefore remain the subject of a computerized analysis. Nevertheless, the fact that a few pathologists do actually correlate with nuclear texture in scoring, argues in favor of making further attempts to train pathologists to also rely on texture, similar to cytologists, when scoring Barrett's dysplasia.","1122":null,"1123":"","1124":"Lung cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in the western world. Its frequent association with a wide spectrum of mutations in genes encoding various signal transducers that are often linked to therapy response, emphasizes the obvious need for improved, fast and highly efficient approaches in molecular pathology. Comprehensive analyses of the mutation status of progression and therapy relevant genes can be performed by the novel sequencing forms named next generation sequencing (NGS) providing extremely high capacities for ultra-deep sequence analyses. The 454 pyrosequencing method, the sequencing by synthesis and the semiconductor sequencing platform are now available for parallel sequencing approaches of multitudinous target genes linked to multiple tumor DNA applications. The \"one molecule, one clone, one read\" principle by the NGS approaches supplies not only information on allele frequencies and mutation rates but also has the advantage of a very sensitive detection of low frequency variants.","1125":"The gross examination of cystic changes in chronic pancreatitis can cause diagnostic problems particularly in the absence of grossly detectable tumor tissue. Besides the more frequently encountered pancreatitis-associated pseudocysts, pancreatic cysts should always raise attention to the differential diagnosis of a true neoplastic process.","1126":"Epithelial misplacement can be present in small bowel polyps of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and can mimic invasive malignancy.

Incidental findings and the challenges posed by the advent of personalised medicine are but two areas which increasingly impact medical disciplines that do not conventionally work directly with patients. Both areas raise questions of what is legally required and morally necessary.

Therefore, sufficient diagnostic criteria of a Carney complex were fulfilled. The Carney complex is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder with highly variable phenotypes, which was initially described by Carney in 1985 as a complex of myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation and endocrine overactivity. Pathologists should consider this differential diagnosis in reports when confronted with a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma.","1132":"","1133":"An unusual transmural tumor-like myxoid lesion was found in the cervix of the hysterectomy specimen of a 43-year-old woman. Histochemically the lesion was positive for alcian blue but negative for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. The immunohistochemical staining showed positive reactions for CD10 and CD34 but negative reactions for actin. The incidence of this lesion is unknown. Isolated involvement of the cervix as in the current case has not been described before. Several theories have been put forward for the pathogenesis of this lesion: 1) transfer of subepithelial tissue from the lower genital tract in the cervical region, 2) sequelae of progesterone therapy, 3) association with an autoimmune disease and 4) association with hypothyroidism. The current case does also not serve to solve the question on the pathogenesis of this lesion. ","1134":"Benign epithelial tumors of the tracheobronchial system and the lungs are exceedingly rare. These entities encompass squamous and glandular papillomas (as well as their mixed forms) and adenomas (alveolar adenoma, papillary adenoma, salivary gland-like pleomorphic and mucinous adenomas and mucinous cystadenomas). These tumors are considered to be biologically benign neoplasms; however, they can pose considerable diagnostic difficulties, especially during frozen section evaluation, as they can mimic malignant tumors and in particular they can resemble well differentiated papillary adenocarcinomas. As a result of the extreme rarity of these tumors only a few descriptive diagnostic series exist and a systematic investigation including molecular data does not exist. This article presents the case of a 64-year-old patient with a glandular papilloma of the right main bronchus including the immunohistochemical and molecular work-up as well as a review of the current literature.

In this case report of a 49-year-old man who had been bitten by a dog in Asia, the rabies infection of cardiac nerves and cardiac muscle fibres is shown by immunohistochemistry. The neuritis cordis and rabies myocarditis can have important clinical effects on the heart rate and myocardial function and lead to blood pressure crises which are typical for the clinical course of rabies in humans.","1136":"Recent years have witnessed significant achievements in light microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostics in gynecopathology. In this article four topics will be discussed as examples. The squamous precancerous and carcinomatous lesions of the female anogenital tract and the cervix are caused by a transforming high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. No differences in morphological findings can be found between the different locations. In contrast to the current WHO classification a new categorization into low grade and high grade precancerous lesions is suggested. Only some cervical adenocarcinomas are related to high risk HPV infection. Nevertheless, some of these unusual variants demonstrate p16 overexpression. Uterine leiomyosarcomas are clinically aggressive neoplasms independent of the histological grade and in most cases curative treatment is not feasible. It is most important to distinguish leiomyosarcoma from those leiomyoma variants which mimic uterine leiomyosarcoma. Pelvic and ovarian serous carcinomas can be separated into low grade and high grade types which differ significantly in formal pathogenesis, molecular features and pathomorphological findings. Significant differences are also obvious in clinical behavior and response to chemotherapy regimens.","1137":"In the gastrointestinal tract an accurate diagnosis of tumor-like lesions can be challenging. In patients with reflux disease regenerative hyperplasia of esophageal squamous epithelium may show marked pleomorphism and atypia thereby simulating malignancy. Bizarre stromal cells are another diagnostic pitfall. We present the case of a 46-year-old patient with symptoms of reflux disease who was diagnosed with a benign inflammatory polyp at the distal end of the esophagus. Histology revealed bizarre cells within the stroma of the polyp characterized by nuclear hyperchromatism and enlargement. Mitoses were not observed. The atypical cells were positive for vimentin. The Ki67\/MIB-1 proliferation rate was low. The morphology and etiology of bizarre stromal cells, including helpful features for differential diagnosis are thoroughly discussed.","1138":null,"1139":"The intramuscular myxoma is a rare benign soft tissue tumor characterized by bland spindle-shaped and stellate cells embedded in hypovascular myxoid stroma.

The lesions exhibit a considerable variation in number and size. No malignant transformation has yet been reported. From the pathologists' point of view an inflammatory or neoplastic process has to be excluded as the cause of the non-distinctive endoscopic findings.","1142":"Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most frequent malignant tumor of the pancreas and total resection of the pancreatic tumor is still the only curative treatment option. Most tumors are located in the pancreatic head, therefore, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple PPPD) is the oncological standard procedure. By concentrating pancreatic resections in specialized centers for pancreatic surgery perioperative mortality and morbidity has decreased in recent years. However, pancreatic resections remain complex and difficult operations and pancreatic anastomosis is particular challenging. To achieve complete resection (R0) resection and reconstruction of large venous vessels is often necessary. Resection of arterial vessels is rarely performed and usually does not lead to an R0 resection of the tumor. Currently adjuvant chemotherapy after total tumor resection is standard of care for all tumor stages but neoadjuvant regimes have recently been reported increasingly more often. Advances in translational research has led to a better understanding of tumor biology and new diagnostic options and therapies are expected in the near future.","1143":"Mastocytosis and myeloid eosinophilic neoplasms are rare diseases of the bone marrow and are often a diagnostic challenge for hematopathologists. In mastocytosis, compact mast cell infiltrates represent the main diagnostic criterion and for myeloid eosinophilic neoplasms, eosinophilic granulocytes dominate the histological picture. Both disease groups include phenotypically and prognostically very different entities which are each defined by WHO criteria. For systemic mastocytosis (SM), a differentiation between indolent and aggressive or even leukemic forms is of prognostic importance. In indolent variants of SM, a local and\/or systemic, usually reactive increase in eosinophilic granulocytes (SM-eo) is often observed. In contrast, an increase in neoplastic eosinophils is often observed in advanced SM, predominantly in diseases designated SM with associated non-mastocytic hematological neoplasms (SM-AHNMD), e.g. in SM with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (SM-CEL). Apart from mastocytoses, immunophenotypically aberrant tissue mast cells are only observed in certain rare forms of myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, in particular in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN-eo) with cytogenic anomalies in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of eosinophilic leukemias, however, fulfils the morphological and clinical requirements in a limited way only and needs an update.","1144":"Due to the heterogeneity of these disorders, the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) requires a broad spectrum of laboratory techniques: cytomorphology, immunophenotyping, chromosome banding analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular genetics. The cytomorphological leukemia subtypes can be indicative for distinct genetic alterations and contribute to the guidance of the further diagnostic process. Immunophenotyping allows to define the hematological lineage and to characterize the leukemia-associated immunophenotype as basis for follow up investigation. Cytogenetic alterations and molecular mutations are essential for the correct classification of cases and for prognostication. Molecular markers are helpful to define the minimal residual disease load after the achievement of hematological complete remission. In cases of hypocellular AML or in case of bone marrow necrosis, histopathology in combination with immunohistochemistry is of importance. Hierarchies between the different techniques catalyze the workflow in the laboratory and allow a rapid diagnosis and classification of the leukemia cases.","1145":"A bone marrow biopsy in a patient with a diagnosis of lymphoma is often performed as part of the staging procedures, i.e. to find out whether or not the bone marrow harbors infiltrates of an already diagnosed tumor. On the other hand, occasionally changes in the peripheral blood count or an M-protein in the serum lead to a bone marrow biopsy in which the first diagnosis of a malignant lymphoma is established. In either case, the diagnosis of lymphomas and lymphatic leukemias in the bone marrow requires an integration of clinical data, cytomorphology, the topographic distribution of the infiltrate and immunohistochemical as well as molecular techniques, where required. This may particularly be the case when confirmation or exclusion of conventionally barely detectable infiltrates (e.g. hairy cell leukemia, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, plasma cell infiltrates) is required.","1146":"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (chronic myeloproliferative disorders according to former nomenclature) comprise chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia and systemic mastocytosis. All disorders have excessive proliferation of one or more hematopoietic lineages in common and progress with different probability to blast crisis or fibrosis. A further common feature is provided by the activating mutation of tyrosin kinases and associated pathways of signal transduction (BCR-ABL, JAK2(V617F), MPL(W515L\/K), KIT(D816V) and FIP1L1-PDGFRA) causative for the abnormal proliferation. With regard to diagnosis and therapy these mutations are of utmost importance because they enable the exclusion of reactive processes, contribute with varying specificity to subtyping of MPN and are at least partly sensitive to targeted therapy. The molecular mechanisms of blastic and fibrotic progression are not yet understood.","1147":"Bone marrow diagnostics is an essential tool in routine hematological clinical practice. Not only conventional cytological and histological approaches but also more modern techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics are used. The molecular basis of more and more hematological disorders is being discovered and makes its way not only into routine diagnostics but also into daily clinical practice. Recurrent genomic aberrations associated with the individual patient prognosis are well characterized and are being applied in differential therapeutic decisions. In addition, understanding deregulated biochemical pathways have led to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. This review outlines the value of bone marrow diagnostics in hematological diseases with a focus on the currently emerging molecular diagnostic possibilities.","1148":"The rapid technological development in diagnostic pathology, especially of immunohistochemical and molecular techniques, also has a significant impact on diagnostic procedures for the evaluation of bone marrow trephine biopsies. The necessity for optimal morphology, combined with preservation of tissue antigens and nucleic acids on one hand and the wish for short turnaround times on the other hand require careful planning of the workflow for fixation, decalcification and embedding of trephines. Although any kind of bone marrow processing has its advantages and disadvantages, formalin fixation followed by EDTA decalcification can be considered a good compromise, which does not restrict the use of molecular techniques. Although the majority of molecular studies in haematological neoplasms are routinely performed on bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood cells, there are certain indications, in which molecular studies such as clonality determination or detection of specific mutations need to be performed on the trephine biopsy. Especially, the determination of B- or T-cell clonality for the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies requires stringent quality controls and knowledge of technical pitfalls. In this review, we discuss technical aspects of bone marrow biopsy processing and the application of diagnostic molecular techniques.","1149":"","1150":"","1151":"","1152":null,"1153":"The histopathological lymph node staging is of crucial importance for the prognosis estimation and therapy stratification in gastrointestinal cancer. However, the recommended numbers of lymph nodes that should be evaluated are often not reached in routine practice. Methylene blue assisted lymph node dissection was introduced as a new, simple and efficient technique to improve lymph node harvest in gastrointestinal cancer. This method is inexpensive, causes no delay and needs no toxic substances. All studies performed revealed a highly significantly improved lymph node harvest in comparison to the conventional technique. Moreover, this technique can be combined with a new ex vivo sentinel lymph node mapping that for the first time is based on histological sentinel lymph node detection. The success rate of this method is similar to conventional techniques and it enables an efficient application of extended investigation methods, such as immunohistochemistry or the polymerase chain reaction.","1154":"Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a highly fibrotic malignancy, which exhibits a prominent desmoplastic stroma. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the main modes of carcinoma invasion. We identified the stromal N-glycoprotein periostin by mass spectrometry of lung adenocarcinoma pleural effusions. Validation on a NSCLC tissue microarray and on tumor whole sections by immunohistochemistry indicated that periostin is strongly upregulated at the invasive front in both tumor epithelia and the surrounding matricellular space. In comparison to collagen, elastin and vimentin, periostin was found to be most closely associated with parameters of tumor progression such as larger size and higher stage, with the squamous cell histotype, and with decreased survival. An association with decreased survival was also found for the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM. In conclusion, enlargement of NSCLC tumors is associated with an increase of desmoplastic stroma and concomitant upregulation of EMT markers at the invasive front. The tumor-stroma interface may be a candidate topographic region for stroma- or EMT-directed therapy.","1155":"Cooperation between pathology and surgery plays a decisive role in the treatment of carcinoma of the esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and stomach. Preoperatively, the carcinoma is confirmed and the histologic type, grading, type of extension (stomach) and immunohistochemical or molecular-biological parameters, if necessary, are determined. For exclusion or diagnosis of distant metastases, peritoneal carcinosis, or secondary tumors, further biopsies or cytological examinations may be required. All results contribute to the individualized treatment. In case of endoscopic treatment, the completeness of resection of the carcinoma and the depth of infiltration must be identified with extraordinary diligence. Postoperative proof of tumor, location, histological type, completeness of resection and safety margin have to be identified. Detailed T-status, N-status with declaration of the ratio of affected and nonaffected number of lymph nodes, location of affected lymph nodes, extracapsular lymph node spread, invasion of lymphatic and vascular vessels and perineural sheets are important parameters. The description of tumor regression after neoadjuvant treatment (histomorphological response) is of special interest.","1156":"In breast cancer, tumor biological markers are gaining impact and have become equal to traditional markers of pathology. Molecular expression profiling has led to new categories, which by receiving translation into immunohistochemical terms have entered routine pathology use. Besides the triple negative (basal) type, there are hormone receptor positive luminal A and B types and the HER2 type. The distinction between luminal A and B type is not yet clear cut and the proliferation marker Ki-67 as well as diverse RNA expression profiles are used for distinction in order to decide which patients might benefit from pure endocrine and which from combined chemo-endocrine therapy. Prospective studies are necessary to answer these questions. Study data are further awaited to clarify the heterogeneity of triple negative cases which include most of the BRCA1 associated cancers and to elucidate whether within the HER2 category, polysome or pseudopolysome cancer will respond to therapy.","1157":"Myelosarcomas are, due to their rarity, a difficult differential diagnosis. Not infrequently, extensive immunohistochemical staining for characterization of the tumor is performed, if one does not directly think of myelosarcoma. In the present case, there was a positivity of the myeloid blasts for cytokeratin. This may complicate the discrimination of myelosarcoma from carcinoma, in particular small cell carcinoma, not only in the mediastinum, but also in the skin, e.g., Merkel cell carcinoma.","1158":null,"1159":"Renal carcinoma biomarkers are of potential interest for the diagnosis of renal tumor subtypes and prediction of prognosis or reponses to targeted therapies.

Therapeutic decisions are still based on correct tumor classification, tumor differentiation grade, and tumor stage. Recent studies have emphasized the relevance of detailed analysis of hilus fat tissue for a correct pT-category.

To date, 141 probands harboring more than 100 different germline CDH1 alterations, mainly point mutations and large deletions, have been described. In mutation-positive individuals prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended. The systematic histological study of prophylactic gastrectomies shows intramucosal signet-ring cell carcinoma and pre-invasive lesions including in situ signet ring carcinoma with pagetoid spread of signet ring cells. In 2011, a new hereditary gastric cancer syndrome was identified: gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS). GAPPS is a unique gastric polyposis syndrome with a significant risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, characterized by the autosomal dominant transmission of fundic gland polyposis, with areas of dysplasia or intestinal-type GC, restricted to the proximal stomach, with no evidence of colorectal or duodenal polyposis or other heritable gastrointestinal cancer syndromes.","1161":"","1162":"The introduction of total genome sequencing led to the confirmation that tumors show substantial genetic heterogeneity.

The frequency of detection of precursor lesions of carcinoma (e.g. dysplasia, intraepithelial neoplasia and adenoma) has increased in recent years, which is most probably due to better endoscopic detection and thus improved histological diagnosis. Carcinogenesis of colitis-associated neoplasms is different from carcinogenesis in sporadic neoplasms because mutations and epigenetic changes are different or may occur at a different point in time. In the present article, these differences will be described and placed in context with carcinogenesis in ulcerative colitis.","1164":"There is a continuously increasing incidence in inflammatory bowel diseases affecting mostly young people who are in a vulnerable phase of life. Thus, early diagnosis and initiation of an effective therapeutic regimen is critical in order to maintain a good quality of life. In Germany, the standard therapeutic strategy is an accelerated step up approach, including the introduction of early immunosuppressive therapy if required. Although novel therapeutic strategies have found their way into clinical use there is still a substantial subgroup of patients where effective therapy is lacking. The future introduction of anti-adhesion molecule antibodies might provide a realistic option for this subgroup. Equally important is the availability of predictive markers allowing stratification of patients into subgroups at the time of diagnosis. Assuming that the CD8(+) T cell transcriptome approach will be confirmed in prospective trials, personalized therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease will be the next step.","1165":"Diabetic mouse models created via random mutagenesis or genetic modification are essential tools to unravel the mechanisms involved in the development of diabetes mellitus and associated diseases. Three diabetic mutant mouse lines derived from the Munich N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mouse mutagenesis project and one transgenic mouse line were analyzed with respect to diabetes-relevant clinical, pathomorphological and therapeutic aspects. An Ins2 mutation and two Gck mutations were identified as the cause of diabetes mellitus in the mutant lines. Heterozygous Ins2 and homozygous Gck mutants serve as model for permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) and heterozygous Gck mutants develop maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2. Dominant-negative glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR(dn)) transgenic mice exhibit defective postnatal islet growth, develop PNDM and progressive diabetes-associated kidney lesions. The mutant and transgenic diabetic mouse models analyzed in the study were shown to represent valuable models to study the pathogenesis of monogenic diabetes and to establish novel treatment strategies.","1166":"","1167":"","1168":"","1169":"","1170":"During tumorigenesis cancer cells acquire certain features allowing for sustained growth and circumvention of programmed cell death. For decades cancer research has been focused on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and how to overcome apoptosis resistance in tumor cells. Meanwhile, novel types of programmed cell death have turned out to be important for both physiological and pathological processes. Recent findings imply that induction of alternative forms of programmed cell death, such as necroptosis, might be used as a therapeutic approach to overcome therapy resistance in cancer.","1171":"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated esophageal disease with clinical symptoms and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. The diagnosis of EoE is therefore complex. It is not reflux or infectious or drug-induced. Histological cases with a high number of eosinophils are not a diagnostic problem. However, limits are of necessity in borderline cases. These must be based on the high power field (HPF) size and the percentage of squamous epithelium covering an HPF, which may greatly vary. Also, it must be considered that EoE is patchy in nature. In order to establish a reliable diagnosis a minimal number of biopsies is essential. Alongside the number of eosinophils further histological features associated with EoE, such as abcesses of eosinophils or basal layer enlargement, may be of diagnostic help in borderline cases.","1172":"Currently, lymphoma diagnosis is based on a combination of morphology, immunophenotyping, and molecular testing. Using the example of an unusual case of malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we show that improved visualization using digital pathology contributes to the convergence of these complementary diagnostic modalities. A 45-year-old woman presented with skin rash and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histological workup of an excised lymph node showed loss of normal architecture with diffuse infiltration and increased mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry for CD3\/CD5 showed atypical arrangement and infiltration of a T-cell population that dominated over regionally dense, MUM1-positive plasmacellular infiltrates. Expanded CD21\/CD23-positive meshworks of follicular dendritic cells were present within and between regressed follicles and the T-cell infiltrate; staining for CD56 and cyclin-D1 was negative. Quantification of Ki-67 staining within the T-, B- and plasmacellular compartments was achieved by digital image conversion, overlay and subsequent quantification algorithms that revealed proliferation within more than 60% of T-cells, over 50% of plasma cells and only 20% of B-cells. Clonality analysis by PCR revealed monoclonal rearrangement for both T-cell receptor gamma chains and immunoglobulin heavy chains. Taken together, we present an unusual combination of an angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and simultaneous plasmacellular lymphoma. This report demonstrates how application of modern tools of digital pathology can visually integrate unusual morphological and molecular findings.","1173":"The identification and characterization of precursor lesions is fundamental to develop screening programs for early diagnosis and treatment, aiming at reducing cancer-related mortality. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that becomes clinical apparent only in advanced stages. In order to enable screening procedures for early detection of PDAC, an exact characterization of precursor lesions is of utmost importance. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN) are the most frequent and best characterized precursors of PDAC and are lesions with a ductal phenotype thus indicating a ductal cell origin of PDAC. However, evidence from genetically engineered mouse models suggests that tubular complexes (TC) originating through a process of acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM) form atypical flat lesions (AFL) that may represent an alternative pathway of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Based on a thorough morphological and genetic analysis of murine TC, AFL and PanIN and their human counterparts, a new dual model of pancreatic carcinogenesis is proposed taking into account the role of AFL as possible new precursors of PDAC.","1174":"The definition of Barrett esophagus is currently under discussion. It is now suggested that a distal esophagus coated with cylinder epithelium with cardia-fundus mucosa should also be classified as Barrett esophagus because the risk of cancer is significantly increased even without histological evidence of intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells. The results of recent epidemiological investigations imply that the cancer risk of cylinder cell metaplasia and low grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett esophagus has previously been overestimated. The histological detection of dysplasia still remains the best biomarker for estimation of the risk of cancer of Barrett esophagus. Exact determination of invasion depth in the mucosa, respective submucosa is now established as prognostic marker for overall survival in Patients with early carcinomas and this classification is useful for therapy decisions (endoscopic versus surgical removal). In advanced Barrett carcinoma following neoadjuvant therapy the lymph node status (ypN) is a better prognostic factor than the ypT category. In metastasized tumors therapies targeting HER2\/new, EGFR or c-Met have been investigated explicitly in Barrett carcinoma only in phase I\/II studies, whereby the predictive value of appropriate molecular pathology investigations is not yet reliably established.","1175":"Eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant esophageal inflammation. Eosinophilic inflammation in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract is absent and several differential diagnoses for esophageal eosinophilia have to be excluded before diagnosing eosinophilic esophagitis. Most patients are male and have concomitant atopic disorders. Therapeutic options are based on drugs, diet and dilation.","1176":"In order to guarantee a unified application of the R classification, the S3 guidelines were amended. With the introduction of the so-called CRM concept the special situation of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head can be taken into account. In contrast to the R classification, in the CRM concept lymph node metastases, lymph vessel and perineural sheath infiltration are taken into consideration. The distance of the tumor from the resection margins is particularly documented. Because of the prognostic significance of tumor-free lymph nodes, in future the lymph node ratio should be given. This is defined as the relationship of lymph node metastases to the total number of lymph nodes removed\/examined.","1177":"","1178":"Histological examination of bone marrow biopsies is an important and powerful diagnostic tool to assess various hematological and non-hematological disorders. Morphological examination of such biopsies requires knowledge of the composition of normal bone marrow and its variations, such as age-related changes. Diagnostic problems may arise due to poor specimen quality, insufficient sections or stainings and insufficient experience with reactive bone marrow changes which occasionally resemble neoplastic disorders. Reactive bone marrow processes can affect one or more hematopoietic cell lines, lead to disruption of the normal architecture and specifically affect the bone marrow stroma. Optimal bone marrow diagnosis requires adequately stained slides and, when needed, immunophenotyping and molecular examinations. Furthermore, rather than biopsy interpretation of other organs, pathologists routinely need clinical history information for correct interpretation and diagnosis of bone marrow changes. In this article, the normal features of bone marrow as well as the most frequent reactive bone marrow alterations are described.","1179":null,"1180":"","1181":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors in the digestive tract. In up to 90% of cases, they are characterized by activating mutations in the KIT or the PDGFRA gene. GIST represent a paradigm for successful targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Since the approval of the TKI imatinib in 2002 the survival of patients with metastatic GIST has tripled. The next logical step was the concept of using imatinib in an adjuvant approach, which was recently shown to increase overall survival significantly. In both settings, the mutational status has high predictive implications. In detail, GIST with KIT exon 11 mutations show the best response rates with partial remission rates of up to 80%. In KIT exon 9 mutations, a doubled daily dose of 800 mg imatinib is now standard. The PDGFRA exon 18 mutation D842V has been shown to lead to primary resistance. The treatment strategy in GIST is driven by their molecular characterisation. Further research has increased our knowledge on resistance mechanisms in solid tumors against TKI. The number of patients with secondary resistance due to acquired KIT mutations is increasing with treatment duration. Strategies to address this situation are the introduction of novel pathway inhibitors targeting different levels of signal transduction pathways, such as the mTOR\/Akt pathway, the RAS\/RAF pathway, histone deacetylation, among others. Among the GIST without mutations in the common hot spot regions of KIT and PDGFRA, the so-called wildtype GIST, further genomic subgroups have been identified. One such subgroup carries inactivating germline mutations in the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase B, C, or D. They are associated with the occurrence of paragangliomas, so-called Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Most frequently, these GIST are located in the stomach, showing an epithelioid phenotype and a multinodular growth pattern. They preferentially occur in young females and often show lymph node metastases, the latter being very unusual in sporadic GIST. In sporadic Carney's triad additional pulmonary chondromas are observed and there are no SDH mutations. Another small subgroup of sporadic GIST present with BRAF mutations as an alternative genomic event. Finally, very rare kindreds with germline mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA have been described who develop multiple GIST and depending on the mutational subtype mastocytosis, hyperpigmentation and\/or dysphagia. In summary, the molecular characterisation of GIST has revolutionized their treatment due to increasing knowledge about the high relevance of predictive molecular typing in solid tumors.","1182":"","1183":"Lung cancer is the most common malignant disease leading to death worldwide. Histologically, it is broadly subcategorized into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the latter mainly consisting of the major entities adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. However, molecular profiling of various lung cancer entities has revealed major molecular differences within distinct histological tumor entities, resulting in the integration of molecular alterations in the subclassification of lung cancers. These findings can only estimate the genetic complexity of lung tumors. Large scale molecular profiling has the potential to identify novel diagnostic, prognostic and predictive markers as well as therapeutic targets. Importantly, this recently arising categorization of lung carcinomas can be regarded as an example for the characterization of malignomas of other organ systems. The pioneer model for this molecular subcategorization is the classification of malignant lymphomas.","1184":"Although early stage malignant melanoma (MM) has a favorable prognosis five year survival rate is poor (&lt;10%) in patients suffering from distant metastases. Due to molecular typing of MM recently high response rates were achieved in metastatic MM by using specific inhibitors directed against the mutated form of BRAF kinase, e.g. Vemurafinib and Dabrafinib. Therefore BRAF mutation analysis has become standard of care in advanced MM and pathologists are urged to provide a quality guaranteed molecular diagnostics. However, squamous neoplasias (e. g., keratoacanthomas) and recurrences of MM mostly within 6 months during targeted therapy point to the need of further translational research. Thus new drugs, such as MEK inhibitors, based on the MAP-kinase pathway downstream of BRAF have already effectively been used. Finally, the impact of molecular characteristics in different subtypes of MM (acral, mucosal, uveal) will be discussed with respect to their specific mutational spectrum (e.g. cKIT , NRAS , GNAQ).","1185":null,"1186":"","1187":"","1188":"Due to the multiplicity of localizations and entities, handling of soft tissue tumors is a very challenging subject requiring intensive interdisciplinary collaboration. With respect to the use of intraoperative frozen sections, the following facts are of special relevance: 1) the usual criteria for malignancy, such as infiltrative growth and high mitotic rate are only restrictedly applicable to soft tissue tumors. 2) Correct diagnosis of the tumor entity often requires not only the use of immunohistochemistry but also the identification of genetic alterations by the polymerase chain reaction and\/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. In many centres, 14G core biopsies taken from different tumor areas represent the preferred method for a diagnostic biopsy. Apart from cryocollection additional frozen section investigations are used especially in case of open biopsies for quality control of the submitted material or in cases of excision biopsies to ascertain a highly probable radiological diagnosis. The use of intraoperative frozen sections to clarify the resection margins is generally undisputed but should definitely be restricted to centres specialized and experienced in the handling of soft tissue tumors.","1189":null,"1190":"Adenomas represent the morphological precursors of the vast majority of colorectal cancers: although every adenoma has the capacity of malignant evolution, most adenomas stabilize their progression or even regress. Pathological factors are predictive of the natural history of adenomas in terms of potential and time interval for becoming malignant. Regression of adenomas is histologically well established, but it is thought to be a dynamic process, with cycling phases of regression and growth. Colorectal carcinoma invading the submucosa but not the muscular layer represents the earliest form of clinically relevant colorectal cancer. Grade of differentiation of carcinoma, lymphovascular invasion, and state of the resection margin predict the risk of metastasis. Microstaging of invasive cancer together with tumuor budding allow the metastatic risk to be further stratified into minimal, low, and high. Two distinct profiles are identifiable in the natural history of cancerous adenomas: blocking the growth of early cancer and allowing its progression towards advanced cancer. Thus, biomarkers to distinguish between progressive and non-progressive pT1 neoplasia are needed.","1191":"","1192":null,"1193":"","1194":"","1195":"In breast surgery intraoperative frozen sections for the diagnosis of malignancy has lost impact and has largely been replaced by preoperative core needle biopsies. Nevertheless, there is still need for immediate pathological investigation of native breast tissue during surgery due to three reasons: (1) macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of resection margins, (2) the histological analysis of sentinel lymph nodes in order to circumvent secondary axillary surgery and (3) the preparation of native tissue for tumor banking or measurement of biomarkers. Because histology provides only a facultative component of immediate pathological examination of breast specimens during surgery, the term frozen section does not seem to be appropriate anymore. Intraoperative evaluation of resection specimens by pathologists provides surgically relevant information immediately, guarantees standardized preparation and fixation of specimens and enables tissue banking of native tissue for assessment of biological markers.","1196":"The frozen section procedure for immediate intraoperative pathological diagnosis represents a pivotal method in tumor diagnosis. In laryngeal tumors the most frequent indication for the use of this method is the documentation of the residual tumor status, while intraoperative consultation with the purpose of primary tumor diagnosis is less common. The specimen management employed in each case should be chosen depending on the clinical question: while the collection of a maximum amount of tissue is advisable for the determination of the residual tumor status, sparing a portion of the remaining tissue for possible future examinations is advisable in the case of primary tumor diagnosis. Moreover, intraoperative frozen section diagnosis with no immediate consequences should be avoided.","1197":"Intraoperative consultation (synonym: frozen section diagnostics) has increasingly gained significance for the daily practice in head and neck surgery. The main aim of this investigation method which is usually associated with much stress and effort is to facilitate an optimal and timely oncological surgical treatment of neoplastic diseases with a minimum rate of postoperative functional disturbance. In order to achieve this purpose pathologists are expected to deliver as much correct information as possible to accurately influence intraoperative surgical decisions. At the same time this aim should be reached without significantly and unnecessarily increasing the workload for the pathology laboratory and without significantly inducing tissue artifacts. This would otherwise negatively influence the tissue quality for permanent section examination and consequently the overall quality of diagnosis and tumor staging. Thus, the quality and efficacy of frozen sections span a spectrum with the highest quality having the least possible false negative rate on the one hand and a false positive result of approximately zero on the other hand. Sticking to this approach would result in a high positive impact on the surgical treatment of a variety of neoplastic diseases and help to minimize or even eliminate the rate of medicolegal consequences.","1198":"Intraoperative frozen sections are particularly important for ovarian tumors because definitive preoperative histology is not possible. The diagnostic accuracy of frozen sections is highest for primary invasive ovarian carcinomas and benign ovarian lesions, followed by borderline tumors and poorest for ovarian metastases and rare neoplasms, such as germ cell tumors. Endometrial carcinoma should be diagnosed preoperatively by curettage or biopsy. For endometrioid endometrial carcinomas the indications for lymphadenectomy are often based on intraoperative assessment of the uterus. The differential diagnosis of low grade stromal neoplasms is based on myometrial invasion and can be supported by assessment of frozen sections as well as the diagnosis of other mesenchymal uterine tumors suspected of being malignant. Frozen sections of pelvic lymph nodes provide the possibility of immediate subsequent para-aortic lymphadenectomy in endometrial and cervical carcinomas but have recently lost importance. Sentinel node biopsy with intraoperative frozen section analysis is routinely performed only for vulval carcinoma. The German Association of Gynecological Oncology (AGO) recommends deferred diagnosis and a two stage surgical procedure for any doubtful intraoperative ovarian histology. Intraoperative frozen sections for endometrial carcinoma and lymphadenectomy specimens as well as for sentinel node biopsies are currently not recommended but are also not completely rejected.","1199":"Bone tumors are very rare and this is the reason why frozen section diagnosis is often difficult. The orthopedic surgeon wants to know the intraoperative diagnosis of biopsies of benign or malignant bone tumors so that definitive treatment can be carried out immediately in cases of diagnostic certainty. Diagnostic problems not only concern the distinction of benign and malignant tumors but also differentiation of a neoplastic from a reactive process. Clinical information is very important and all patients with bone tumors are discussed before surgical treatment in an interdisciplinary tumor board. Internationally but with the exception of the USA, the diagnostic procedure using frozen sections is not commonly used even in specialized centers.","1200":"Intraoperative examination of specimens from the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder and pancreas are widely used in routine fresh frozen section diagnostics.

In the future, it may become more important due to a significant increase in the number of nerve-sparing operations performed for prostate cancer. Accuracy and benefit of intraoperative frozen sections depend both on a good communication between surgeons and pathologists as well as on a strict assessment of the need for surgery in the individual patient. In order to optimize cost-efficiency and to reduce the associated risks the indications for intraoperative frozen sections must be rigorously appraised. This report outlines clinically relevant indications for intraoperative frozen section diagnosis in tumors of the urinary tract, kidneys, prostate, testis and penis according to the most recent guidelines.

In addition to frozen sections, cytological examinations of smear and touch preparations as supporting methods are available to reach a correct diagnosis: these additional methods should therefore be performed whenever possible. Besides evaluation of biopsy specimens, appraisal of resection specimens and resection margin controls are of high clinical relevance. In the case of diffusely infiltrating central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms, in particular gliomas, resection margin control is often not feasible in contrast to other types of solid tumor.","1204":"A close collaboration between clinicians and pathologists is essential for establishing an optimal therapeutic concept concerning disorders of the stomach and intestines. Intraoperative frozen sections form part of this cooperation in order to obtain an intraoperative diagnosis or to clarify unclear findings and to be able to adapt operative procedures accordingly.

The same objective is pursued by establishing an unhindered flow of information.","1205":"","1206":"Recommendations for the diagnosis of lung tumors almost limit the use of fresh frozen sections to the evaluation of resection margins. In pathology pretherapeutic methods for assessment of clinically suspected lung cancer are favored over intraoperative frozen section diagnosis. For the interdisciplinary management of uncertain lung findings diagnostic methods, such as cytopathology and examination of biopsy material are available. The use of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) in cytopathology is limited due to the lack of necessary personnel. Diagnosis of unclear pulmonary lesions or distinction of metastases from primary lung tumors by intraoperative frozen sections is therefore limited to exceptional cases that were not resolved by preoperative biopsies. Such rare cases require a common consensus strategy between thoracic surgeons and pathologists in a preoperative tumor board.","1207":null,"1208":"Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has become an important tool in the diagnosis and staging of malignant tumors of the lungs and mediastinum.

This results in a significant decrease in the number of repeated bronchoscopy procedures required to recover an adequate biopsy sample and is therefore both time and cost effective.

The aim was to ensure adequate terminology without risk of errors in understanding, to advise clinicians concerning therapeutic options in relationship to cytological diagnoses as well as to facilitate the comparison of cytology data at national and international levels. However, mainly due to specific US American (both medical and legal) demands, this classification system is not yet fully appreciated in most European countries. The reasons are various: (a) Criteria for representative material are much more restrictive than those commonly used and in Germany a higher number of (unnecessary) repunctures would be the consequence. (b) It remains doubtful whether the introduction of a new and rather heterogeneous category of \"atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance\" would contribute to a substantial decrease of findings classified as \"follicular neoplasia\". Furthermore it is unlikely that clinicians would be willing to accept the recommended conservative approach with repuncture if a new diagnostic category is associated with a calculated risk of malignancy in 5-15% cases. (c) Until now an integration of new developments in molecular markers into the Bethesda system is missing. Thus, for experienced cytologists the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology offers very limited benefits in comparison to the currently used, established and highly accepted classification systems. However, a positive argument remains the fact that an internationally accepted classification system may improve the comparability of the results of national and international studies on thyroid findings.","1210":"An osteolytic tumor of the 7(th) rib was surgically removed from a 40-year-old patient. Immunohistochemical investigations showed that neither epithelial markers nor B and T cell markers were expressed in the tumor tissue; however, there was strong expression of VS38 and vimentin. These results were compatible with a solitary plasmocytoma of the bone. Further immunohistochemical investigations detected an expression of the melanoma markers S-100 and melan-A.

Requirements for cytopathologists in lung cancer diagnosis have therefore changed. The general diagnostic category of NSLC is no longer sufficient. In addition cytological specimens need to be evaluated for adequacy regarding predictive marker analyses. Accurate NSCLC subtyping with a distinction of adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma is crucial for treatment decisions as the subtype will decide on the chemotherapy regimen and the choice of predictive marker analyses for targeted treatment. In the majority of cases, the subtype can be diagnosed by morphology alone. Cytology is equally well suited as biopsy specimens for the assessment of molecular predictive markers. The best results are achieved when both cytology and biopsy specimens are compared to choose the most appropriate specimen for morphological subtyping and molecular testing. In this paper, we discuss special issues of NSCLC subtyping and currently recommended predictive molecular marker analyses.","1214":"Compared to other European and non-European countries the benefits of cytopathology for the diagnosis of many tumors is still underestimated in Germany for traditional reasons. Cytological methods provide excellent material from many organs for morphological, immunochemical and molecular examinations so that a definitive diagnosis is cytologically possible in many cases and the number of exploratory surgical operations could therefore be reduced. Improvements in this deplorable situation will only be possible if a standardized training period in cytology is consistently included in the training of general pathologists.

A 12-year-old boy who suffered from infectious mononucleosis with liver involvement and hepatomegaly underwent a sonographic scan of the liver at an external hospital 3 months after the infection disappeared which revealed a tumor of the left hepatic lobule. Subsequent further examination (abdominal CT and MRT scans) confirmed the diagnosis of a highly vascularized mass about 10 cm in diameter, suspicious for FNH. Due to the high vascularization no biopsy was performed. A preoperative angiographic coiling and complete surgical resection was carried out because of the size and morphologic uncertainty. The diagnosis of FNH was confirmed by histological examination. The annual sonographic examination at follow-up has been uneventful for a 4-year period. Due to the rarity the diagnosis of FNH in children can be difficult leading to differential diagnostic problems. Due to the risk of bleeding in larger size tumors a biopsy is a point of controversy. Complete resection and histopathological examination of FNHs in childhood is a mandatory therapeutic option, which may be indicated in large tumors or, as in the present case tumors of uncertain biological behaviour. ","1239":"Tubulosquamous vaginal polyp is a rare form of lesion. It is thought to derive from displaced paraurethral Skene's gland which is the female equivalent of the prostate gland in men. We report on a case of tubulosquamous vaginal polyp in a 77-year-old female patient. Histological examination showed prominent epithelial nests in a spindle cell-rich stroma. The nests were predominantly squamous in type with small tubules at the periphery of the island. Using immunohistochemistry the tubules were found to be positive for CK7, prostate-specific acidic phosphatase (PAP) and androgen receptor (AR) but negative for CK 5\/6 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The solid parts were positive for CK5\/6 and most interestingly, also expressed AR but not CK7, PAP or PSA. The stroma also showed strong staining for AR but not for the other markers applied. To our knowledge this is the first report on AR expression in this benign polyp. Our findings confirm the view that tubulosquamous polyp of the vagina is derived from paraurethral Skene's gland.","1240":"Tracheopathia osteoplastica is a very rare disease of the tracheobronchial tree with unknown origin and etiopathogenesis. The characteristic features are intramucosal nodules in the tracheal and\/or bronchial mucosa. The clinical symptoms are unspecific and in most of the cases are consequences of airway stenosis. A collective of patient cases (4 tracheobronchial biopsies and 16 autopsy cases) was established to study the histology of tracheopathia osteoplastica and consisted of surgical pathology specimens (biopsies) and autopsy material. The study revealed two different types of tracheal ossification and nodule formation: (1) degenerative changes with nodule formation and ossification (tracheopathia osteoplastica tuberosa) and (2) diffuse degeneration of the tracheal cartilage with ossification of the outer third of the cartilaginous rings (tracheopathia osteoplastica peripherica). The histological changes indicate that tracheopathia osteoplastica is a type of sclerosing tracheopathy but the degenerative focus is at an unusual place (in the middle of the cartilage). No type of new cartilage formation was found in any of the cases.","1241":"Diagnosing and grading of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) are part of the routine practice of pathologists. However, discriminating between reactive changes and CIN1 and determining the different degrees of CIN may be challenging. Aim of this study was the evaluation of the proliferation markers Ki-67 and Mcm2 as well as p16 for their potential to aid in the assessment of CIN. 297 samples of normal epithelium, CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3 were assessed for expression of the above mentioned markers using tissue microarrays. There was an increase in the expression of Ki67 and Mcm2 from normal epithelium, CIN1, CIN2 to CIN3 (p&lt;0.001 for both markers). Ki-67 was the most useful marker in differentiating between normal epithelium and CIN1. The number of p16-positive cases was 7% in CIN1, 46% in CIN2 and 86% in CIN3. There were no p16-positive cases in the group with normal epithelium. In order to grade CIN1 vs. CIN2 a combination of Ki-67 and p16 was helpful. Cases with a proliferation rate of &lt;25% assessed with Ki-67 were most likely CIN1 (sensitivity 91.7%, specificity: 54.3%, positive predictive value: 73.3%, negative predictive value 82.6%). P16 was the most helpful marker in distinguishing between CIN2 and CIN 3 as p16 negative cases were more likely to belong into the CIN2 category. In summary, the histopathological assessment of cervical biopsies is based on H&amp;E-stained slides. However, Ki-67 and p16 can be helpful in diagnosing and grading cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.","1242":"In pulmonary hypertension there is a discrepancy between the dramatic but unspecific clinical presentation and the remodeling of mostly only limited segments of the vascular compartment of pulmonary parenchyma. Clinical diagnosis relies for the most part on invasive procedures, such as right heart catheterization. Therefore, morphology can provide a reliable etiopathogenetic classification only in close cooperation with the clinical partner disciplines involved. Moreover, the histopathological approach requires intimate knowledge of the vascular anatomy of the lungs and assessment of the parenchyma to be able to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and differentiate between the various types.","1243":null,"1244":"","1245":null,"1246":"Recently the so-called plexiform angiomyxoid myofibroblastic tumors (PAMT) have emerged as a new entity of gastric soft tissue tumors and the light microscopic and immunohistological characteristics have now been well described. Until now PAMTs have not yet been reported in the German speaking literature. Worthy of note is that PAMTs can be diagnosed safely in sufficient biopsy material which enables adequate therapeutic steps to be initiated without delay, because PMATs although considered to be benign, can cause serious complications.","1247":"Granular cell tumors are peripheral neuroectodermal tumors. Within the gastrointestinal tract, they have to be differentiated from gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). We present the case of a 61-year-old patient who was diagnosed with a granular cell tumor of the stomach. The tumor cells showed transmural infiltration form the mucosa into the adipose tissue of the lesser curvature. The tumor cells were diffusely positive for S100-protein and negative for KIT, CD34 und SMA. The MIB1-proliferation index was below 2%. Granular cell tumors rarely occur within the gastrointestinal tract. Oesophagus and colon are most commonly affected. Diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis of this peculiar lesion are thoroughly discussed.","1248":"Preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is a well-established and essential part of the interdisciplinary treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Neoadjuvant treatment leads to regressive changes in tumors. To evaluate the histological tumor response different scoring systems describing regressive changes are used and known as tumor regression grading. Tumor regression grading is usually based on the presence of residual vital tumor cells in proportion to the total tumor size. Currently, no nationally or internationally accepted grading systems exist. In general, common guidelines should be used in the pathohistological diagnostics of tumors after neoadjuvant therapy. In particularly, the standard tumor grading will be replaced by tumor regression grading. Furthermore, tumors after neoadjuvant treatment are marked with the prefix \"y\" in the TNM classification.","1249":"Metastatic involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is rare and may cause considerable difficulties with respect to differential diagnosis. The gastrointestinal tract may either be affected by direct invasion, intraperitoneal dissemination or hematogenous cancer spread, the latter most often originating from malignant melanoma, breast and lung carcinomas. Metastatic deposits primarily develop within the submucosa. Secondary involvement of the mucosa typically leads to centrally depressed and\/or ulcerated (volcano-like) nodular lesions. In histology, lack of a mucosal in situ component favors diagnosis of metastasis, whereas presence of an adenomatous precursor lesion is regarded to be characteristic of primary tumors. This concept, however, has recently been challenged by demonstrating metastatic cancer growth along intact basement membranes within the mucosal layer, i.e. mucosal colonization. The histopathological, immunohistochemical and clinical features of secondary gastrointestinal tumors are discussed in detail, focusing on criteria for differential diagnosis. The prognosis of affected patients is generally poor.","1250":null,"1251":"Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs) are a challenge for the diagnostics and the concept of a histogenetic tumor typing. They are classified into three malignant subgroups: high grade malignant MANECs combine an adenoma or adenocarcinoma with a small cell or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, intermediate grade malignant MANECs consist of a neuroendocrine tumor (NET grade 1 or 2), often a globlet cell carcinoid and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or diffuse carcinoma of signet ring cell type. The prototype of a low grade malignant MANEC is the globlet cell carcinoid. Molecular analysis indicates a common clonal origin of the different components in MANECs. The prognosis is determined by the most aggressive tumor component. The pathogenesis of MANECs is apparently a sequence of increasing malignant transformation which leads either from an adenoma\/adenocarcinoma to a small or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma or from a neuroendocrine tumor (NET), often a globlet cell carcinoid to a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or a diffuse carcinoma of signet ring cell type.","1252":"Tumors of Vater's ampulla are generally uncommon. In this location intestinal type adenomas are frequently found, followed by noninvasive papillary neoplasms of the pancreaticobiliary type and neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids). Carcinomas of Vater's ampulla represent about 0.5% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant epithelial tumor followed by the pancreaticobiliary type adenocarcinoma. Highly malignant neuroendocrine carcinomas of Vater's ampulla are very uncommon. Carcinomas of the ampullary region can be sporadic or a component of several disease syndromes. Designation of large carcinomas as tumors with an ampullary or extra-ampullary origin can be difficult but is of relevance for a TNM conform classification. Helpful in the decision are the relationship between the tumor centre and Vater's ampulla, the existence of premalignant lesions in the ampullary epithelium as well as histology and immunostaining of the tumor.","1253":"Barrett's esophagus (BE), a well-known complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constitutes a precancerous condition for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus. The so-called Barrett's carcinoma shows increasing incidences in countries of the western hemisphere; new data, however, indicate that the rise in incidence is not quite as dramatic as previously assumed. The definition of BE is currently changing: despite good reasons for a purely endoscopic definition of BE, goblet cells are still mandatory for this diagnosis in Germany and the USA. Dysplastic changes in the epithelium are the most important risk factor for the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma and recently dysplasia was subclassified into a more frequent adenomatous (intestinal) and a non-adenomatous (gastric-foveolar) types. The gold standard for diagnosing dysplasia is still H&amp;E staining. The histological diagnosis of dysplasia is still encumbered by a significant interobserver variability, especially regarding the differentiation between low grade dysplasia and inflammatory\/reactive changes and the discrimination between high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Current data, however, show much higher interobserver agreement in endoscopic resection specimens than in biopsies. Nevertheless, the histological diagnosis of dysplasia should be corroborated by an external second opinion because of its clinical consequences. In endoscopic resections of early Barrett's adenocarcinoma, the pathological report has to include a risk stratification for the likelihood of lymphogenic metastases.","1254":"","1255":"Sudden cardiac death is one of the most common causes of death and a significant number of sudden deaths occurs especially in young people. Sudden cardiac death is also frequently represented in forensic autopsy practice. In such cases pathological findings in the heart can often explain the reason for the acute death. These pathological changes include not only myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis and all forms of myocarditis\/endocarditis but also rare diseases, such as hereditary structural or arrythmogenic anomalies, lesions of the cardiac conduction system or primary cardiac tumors.","1256":"Mucinous neoplasms of the appendix are rare tumors, some of them characterized by an enigmatic discrepancy between a benign morphologic appearance and an aggressive biologic potential, associated with a poor prognosis and high mortality. The clinical picture of pseudomyxoma peritonei is, with few exceptions, caused by mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and differs in many aspects from usual peritoneal carcinomatosis. The controversy regarding terminology, diagnostic criteria, classification and therapy of these tumors has lasted for decades. The revised edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Digestive System proposes a uniform reporting system for mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and the peritoneal disease associated with it, thereby creating a comparable basis for pathological diagnosis, clinical therapy and further scientific studies.","1257":"Adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus mainly develop from intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus) through intermediate steps of low-grade and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Histopathological examination of endoscopic biopsies constitutes the gold standard for estimating the cancer risk of a patient with Barrett's esophagus. Several prospective biomarker phase IV studies have demonstrated the predictive value of e.g. allelic loss of TP53, tetraploidy and aneuploidy as well as cyclin D1 expression. Among the relevant biomarkers from retrospective phase III studies are polysomy and specific DNA gains and losses, markers of proliferation (Mib-1) and methylation markers. As there are conflicting results in the literature and these analyses are costly, their use in routine patient care cannot yet be recommended. However, immunostaining for several markers may assist in the classification of intraepithelial neoplasia in individual difficult cases.","1258":"This case of urinary obstruction with short anamnesis illuminates the early tissue reaction to urine extravasation, especially the Tamm-Horsfall protein. The latter becomes organized in the manner of a foreign body substance and drains via ectatic renal lymph vessels and reopened lymphovenous shunts into the intrarenal venous system. Polypoid formations (thromboids) with or without vessel obliteration appear to result in a clinical course of severe renal impairment.","1259":"","1260":"","1261":"The growing potential of modern molecular analysis tools has led to a sharp increase in the understanding of the molecular dimension of pathological processes and, consequently, to a growing influence of pathological diagnoses on the selection of therapeutic approaches. Molecular analysis tools have also led to the understanding that groups of tumors hitherto considered to belong to a single, homogeneous disease entity should rather be divided into subgroups with specific molecular attributes, growth behavior patterns and, consequently, different prognostic characteristics and therapeutic needs. A major factor contributing to the differentiation of these subgroups is the composition of the tumor microenvironment (ME), a compartment that is involved in the control of critical carcinogenetic processes such as angiogenesis and invasive growth. Consequently, the investigation of the ME promises to be a most auspicious field of research for pathologists and there is hope that the increased understanding of the interaction between neoplastic cells and the ME will lead to improved diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer patients.","1262":"The aim of \"virtopsy\" is to utilize modern imaging technology to optimize classical autopsy documentation. The benefits of virtopsy include examiner-independent, objective 3D documentation and its non-invasive approach. Virtopsy is an option in cases where autopsy is rejected by family members or for religious reasons. It is also suitable as a rapid identification and examination tool in large-scale disasters. Forensic findings can be presented to prosecutors and courts in 3D and without bloody images.","1263":null,"1264":"For endometrial adenocarcinoma two precursor lesions are known: endometrioid adenocarcinoma which is the most frequent type 1 carcinoma develops from atypical endometrial hyperplasia whereas endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) is the precursor of serous carcinoma and a subset of clear cell carcinoma both representing type 2 carcinomas. Atypical hyperplasia which shows progression rates into carcinoma of up to 40% is challenged by its poor interobserver reproducibility. A better reproducibility is obtained by the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) concept with fewer categories but it is not compatible with the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of endometrial hyperplasia. The EIN concept includes not only the vast majority of the WHO atypical hyperplasia but also approximately half of the complex hyperplasia without atypia. Rarely, atypical hyperplasia is associated with a secretory or mucinous cell type and two thirds of atypical hyperplasia resolve under long-term high dosage progestin therapy. Immunohistochemistry aids in the differential diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia and EIC. Atypical hyperplasia\/EIN frequently show PTEN and\/or Pax-2 negativity and low Ki-67 and differ from EIC which shows strong diffuse p53 staining and high Ki-67 staining index.","1265":null,"1266":"Although it is possible to classify gastrointestinal tract mucosal changes by numerous classifications that have been published over the last 20 years, none has been accepted worldwide for the daily diagnosis of biopsies.

With regard to carcinomas, the differential diagnosis of well-differentiated neoplasias is addressed including \"minimal deviation\" adenocarcinoma (MDA, malignant adenoma), carcinomas with endometrioid or villoglandular morphology, and mesonephric hyper- and neoplasias. Furthermore, knowledge of HPV-negative glandular (pre-)neoplasias is covered including \"gastric-type\" adenocarcinomas and diagnostic algorithms for discriminating between primary and secondary cervical adenocarcinomas.

In contrast HPV-associated neoplasias are relatively rare and occur only in certain areas of the body. The virus has obviously developed efficient mechanisms for its persistence without inducing too much damage to the host. The formation of neoplasia seems to be more an exception. Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the regulation of viral gene expression. Investigations have indicated that exactly the transition from the permissive infection stage to a transformation stage, where neoplastic alterations can occur due to expression of the viral oncogenes, is associated with certain methylation patterns of the viral genome which promote the expression of the oncogenes E6 and E7. The transforming stage is seen as the actual carcinogenic event and can be immunohistochemically detected by the biomarker p16(INK4a).","1273":"","1274":null,"1275":"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and early cervical cancer are characterized by colposcopic minor and major changes and vessel abnormalities.

In the USA and UK evidence based colposcopic guidelines were issued based on cytologic and colposcopic classifications. The German Society of Colposcopy (AG-CPC) published recommendations for the daily practice for all findings. For screening purposes there is no evidence to recommend colposcopy. In these cases, cytology is at the forefront, whereas colposcopy is only indicated in cases of conspicuous or unclear cytological results.","1276":null,"1277":"","1278":"Multiple factors have affected the decline in autopsy rates. Discrepancies between clinical diagnoses and findings at autopsy are frequently used as an argument for a high autopsy rate. However, the quality of the diagnosis is independent of the autopsy rate. A long-term study covering the years 1972-2002 in the University Hospital Zurich has documented a significant reduction of diagnostic errors in internal medicine. Major diagnostic errors (class 1) declined from 16% (1972), to 9% (1982), to 7% (1992) to 2% (2002). The main reason is the availability of new diagnostic procedures. In 2010 the analysis of class 1 diagnostic errors throughout the hospital documented class 1 discrepancies in only 1%. This low number of diagnostic errors has been published in the annual quality report of the University Hospital Zurich. The documentation of this improvement in the quality report of the hospital provides the opportunity to convince clinicians, health politicians and the hospital administration to support autopsies in teaching as well as non-teaching hospitals.","1279":"The number of patients suffering from innate, acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiency is constantly rising. Thus the number of clinically relevant infections caused by rare or unusual pathogens is also increasing. Histopathological investigations allow the identification of difficult to culture infectious agents as well as the differentiation of tissue invasive infections from superficial colonization. In this review morphological reaction patterns and their differential diagnoses of the most common bacterial, viral and mycotic infections in the lungs of immunocompromised patients are discussed.","1280":"About 7-8% of all human cancers are thought to be related to infections with high-risk (HR) human papilloma virus (HPV). Besides cervical cancer, especially squamous cell carcinomas of the anogenital and oropharyngeal regions are associated with HR-HPV. Transmission of HPV is due to sexual activity. Harald zur Hausen was awarded in 2008 with the Nobel price in medicine for the establishment of a causal link between certain HPV infections and cervical cancer. Meanwhile potent prophylactic vaccines are available to prevent infections with HPV-16 and HPV-18, the two most frequently observed HR HPV types worldwide. On molecular grounds a persistent HPV infection is the central risk factor for the development of HPV-associated neoplasias. Continued expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes disrupts cell cycle control mechanisms in infected cells, thereby gaining limitless proliferative capacity and resistance against apoptotic signals. However acquisition of mutations and genomic instability might cause malignant transformation in these cells.","1281":"Aside from bacterial infections, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections are important differential diagnoses in inflammatory disorders of the colorectum. In contrast to bacterial infections, in which the causative organism can hardly ever be detected histologically, in non bacterial infections the germs can often be verified by either histology, immunohistochemistry, or at least by molecular pathology. This manuscript will give an overview of the spectrum of pathogenic germs, the clinical symptoms, and pathological findings of the most important infections.","1282":"The question of whether there are inflammatory changes in colorectal biopsy specimens is frequently asked, especially when the patient reports diarrhea or when the mucosa is reddened on endoscopy. The pathologist first has to find out whether there is, in fact, an increase in the inflammatory infiltrate of the colorectal mucosa which warrants the diagnosis of inflammation. If so, the second challenge is to ascertain the etiology of these inflammatory changes, in particular to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes. In principle, we can distinguish forms of colitis with distinct morphological hallmarks confirming the diagnosis (e.g. microscopic detection of the causative organism, as well as lymphocytic or collagenous colitis) from other forms of colitis which have a characteristic pattern of findings not necessarily allowing to deduce the etiology (e.g. infectious colitis without microscopic evidence of the germ vs. inflammatory bowel disease). The present article discusses the pathomorphology and differential diagnosis of the most important forms of bacterial colitis.","1283":"Early detection is the best prognosis in the curative treatment of oncologic diseases. During early detection tissue is collected which resembles precursor lesions. Based on these lesions a risk for progression for an individual patient should be given. Therefore, prognostic biomarkers are necessary but unfortunately there are not so many prognostic biomarkers known. Among these is the detection of an HPV (human papillomavirus) infection in the case of cervical carcinomas or the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a). Human papillomaviruses are oncogenic DNA viruses, which represent the driving force of almost all cervical carcinomas and p16(INK4a) is an indicator of a premalignant state of epithelial cells which is known as oncogen-induced senescence (OIS). The epithelial cells are in an instable state which collapses in practically all cases, and leads to the progression of tumors. But also for later forms of neoplasia prognostic markers which have proven to be relevant in the daily routine are hardly known. A possible cause might be found in the complexity of the pathogenesis of solid tumors which is associated with a variety of functionally different subtypes. The knowledge of these subgroups should help to define biomarker signatures which might be used for the definition of precursor lesions.","1284":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent and lethal tumors worldwide. Thus, there is an urgent need to elucidate its molecular pathogenesis in order to develop novel diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease. Mounting evidence implies a pivotal role of proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis in the development and progression of human HCC. This review summarizes the data available on the pathogenetic relevance of lipogenic proteins in the growth of liver cancer cells, the mechanisms responsible for unrestrained lipid biosynthesis in HCC and the possible clinical implications arising from these discoveries. Altogether the data implicate the AKT-mTORC1-RPS6 signaling pathway as the main inducer of aberrant lipid synthesis in HCC and are indicative of therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting de novo lipogenesis for the treatment of human liver cancer.","1285":null,"1286":"","1287":"","1288":"","1289":"With the widespread use of screening mammography and core needle biopsies, preneoplastic lesions of the breast are observed with increasing frequency. Unlike low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (lg-DCIS), a possible precursor role of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), lobular neoplasia (LN), and flat epithelial atypia (FEA) as well as their risk of progression have not been clearly defined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the biological potential of these early low-grade lesions in the development of breast cancer. Different series of precursor lesions and syn- or metachronous invasive carcinomas were tested for clonality using mitochondrial DNA sequencing, analysis of E-cadherin inactivation and comparative allelotyping with a panel of 14 polymorphous STR markers. In a series of invasive carcinomas occurring up to 10 years after the initial diagnosis of lobular neoplasia, a direct (clonal) association was established between LN and 3 of 5 invasive lobular cancers (ILC) but not in any of the cases with ductal secondary tumors. Tests on lg-DCIS and FEA occurring in association with tubular breast carcinomas demonstrated a direct clonal relationship in 67 and 70% of cases, respectively, and comparative allelotyping revealed a high degree of homology in the patterns of chromosomal imbalances. In addition, FEA and lg-DCIS, but not LN, were frequently closely related with each other. The present data provide molecular evidence for a direct clonal relationship of LN and ILC as well as of FEA and lg-DCIS with tubular breast carcinomas. However, the multifocal occurrence and frequent coexistence of the different precursor lesions suggests the presence of (possibly hormone-induced) field effects on the breast parenchyma. ","1290":"The so-called serrated pathway has in recent years been well established as a second route of colorectal carcinogenesis. Sessile serrated polyps, especially sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSA) were identified as precursor lesions of this pathway. Activating mutations in either the BRAF (in SSAs) or the KRAS oncogene (in TSAs) have been determined as the initiating molecular alterations, followed by epigenetic methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes which are implicated in cell cycle control or DNA repair. These findings have led to a paradigm shift in gastrointestinal pathology as lesions without cytological dysplasia, such as SSAs and certain forms of hyperplastic polyps, are now accepted to be precancerous lesions. In addition, carcinomas that have developed through the serrated pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis show varying biological behavior relevant for the clinical management of these tumors depending on the molecular aberrations.","1291":"The new WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system not only redefines common diagnostic terms, such as intraepithelial neoplasia and dysplasia but also introduces changes in the nomenclature and diagnostics of colorectal tumors which will be important in daily practice. Changes in nomenclature and classification include the introduction of serrated adenocarcinoma, cribriform comedo type adenocarcinoma and micropapillary adenocarcinoma as new distinct histological subtypes of colorectal cancer. The grading of mucinous and signet ring carcinomas, which were previously invariably graded as G3\/high grade, is now dependent on the microsatellite instability (MSI) status as a high MSI (MSI-H) indicates a better and low or no MSI (MSI-L\/MSS) a worse prognosis. Thus, analysis of microsatellite instability via immunohistochemistry or fragment length analysis must be included in the pathological report of these tumors. Serrated polyps\/adenomas and their potential of progression into colorectal cancer via the alternative pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis will be discussed as well as new insights into prognostic and predictive markers of colorectal cancer. This manuscript will give an overview of the most important changes within the new WHO classification of colorectal tumors.","1292":"Intestinal carcinogenesis is associated with genetic instability affecting either the chromosomal level (CIN) or microsatellite DNA sequences (MIN). In addition, epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant CpG island methylation (CIMP) may contribute to tumor development. While these single genetic alterations have frequently been addressed in intestinal carcinogenesis little is known about the interaction of the epigenetics and genetics in tumorigenesis. This investigation therefore aimed to define the synergistic effects of CIN, MSI and CIMP in small bowel adenocarcinomas. A total of 37 primary small bowel adenocarcinomas were investigated for CIN, MSI, CIMP, KRAS and BRAF mutations. The results showed that CIN was found in 22 out of 37 (57%) tumors (3 out of 9 microsatellite instable and 19 out of 28 microsatellite stable carcinomas) and 9 carcinomas (24%) were microsatellite and chromosomally stable. Aberrant CIMP was detected in 16% of chromosomal instable tumors and in 44% of both microsatellite instable and microsatellite and chromosomally stable carcinomas, KRAS was mutated in 55%, 0% and 10% of chromosomal instable, microsatellite instable and microsatellite and chromosomal stable tumors, respectively, while BRAF mutations occurred in 6% of chromosomal instable and 22% of both microsatellite instable and microsatellite and chromosomal stable carcinomas. Chromosomal instable carcinomas of the small intestine are distinguished from microsatellite instable and microsatellite and chromosomal stable tumors by a high frequency of KRAS mutations and low frequencies of CIMP and BRAF mutations. In microsatellite instable and microsatellite and chromosomally stable cancers, CIMP and BRAF\/KRAS mutations are similarly distributed indicating common mechanisms of tumor initiation or progression in the molecular pathogenesis. ","1293":"Exact knowledge of the incidence and prevalence of precursor lesions of malignant diseases would be of great value for the precise evaluation of their potential clinical-pathological progression and therefore for planning and intervention in individual cases and also for planning and evaluation of prevention and early detection strategies. Concerning these high expectations it is surprising that precise data on incidence, prevalence and the exact risk for progression are lacking. Sources of data (cancer registries, specific registries for precursor lesions, early detection programs and specific designed studies) are analyzed concerning their validity and reliability. Imprecise and redundant terminology represents a crucial reason for the lack of data availability.","1294":"The new WHO classification of tumours of the pancreas logically includes both exocrine and neuroendocrine neoplasms in one volume, thus differing from all previous editions. Ductal adenocarcinoma is still the most frequent and clinically the most relevant malignant tumour. Its subtypes and variants are described in detail, as are mixed tumours. Other ductal tumours [mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPNM)] are classified as neoplasms with various grades of dysplasia up to invasive carcinoma. A new subtype of IPNM, intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN), has been characterized and newly added to the IPMN group. Serous and acinar tumours are classified as neoplasms with varying grades of dysplasia. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is regarded as malignant (low grade) as a matter of principle because of its inherent potential to metastasize. Neuroendocrine neoplasms are characterized as G1 or G2 neuroendocrine tumours (NET) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC, highly malignant). Syndromatic NETs are described and named according to their hormone expression pattern. The problems of staging when applying either the TNM or AJCC\/UICC (American Joint Committee on Cancer\/Union Internationale Contre le Cancer) classifications, which apply equally to endocrine and exocrine tumors, are discussed.","1295":"","1296":"Autopsy rates have declined throughout the world although autopsy serves as an important tool in quality management. Working together with the Department of Heart Surgery of the Heart Centre in Leipzig clinical and autopsy diagnoses were compared. Between 2000 and 2003 an autopsy was performed in 468 patients. Data from clinical and postmortem examinations were prospectively analysed regarding causes of death, concomitant diseases and postoperative complications. Discrepancies between clinical and postmortem cause of death were identified in 23.1% of these patients. In 99.1% of the patients concomitant diseases (e.g. myocardial hypertrophy, pulmonary embolism, former stroke) could be identified, 57.6% were unknown pre-mortem and 19.2% were considered to be of relevance for surgical therapy. Autopsy is the final and most comprehensive physical examination. Autopsy is also the basis of training for pathologists in interpreting interrelated diagnoses. Therefore the task of pathologists is to enhance the appreciation of autopsy among clinical colleagues by working closely side by side.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) comprise the cystic precursors in the pancreas, while intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPN) represents their counterpart in the bile duct system. There is an adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the cystic precursors arising from four different types of epithelia: pancreatobiliary, oncocytic, intestinal and gastric. These subtypes of IPMN\/IPN are morphologically and immunohistochemically well characterised and show clinical and prognostic relevance: the gastric subtype is associated with the best prognosis, followed by the oncocytic and intestinal subtypes, while the pancreatobiliary subtype is characterized by adverse clinical behaviour. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) represent the flat precursors. PanIN are morphologically and biologically well defined. PanIN with lobulocentric atrophy has recently been described as a putative precursor of pancreatic cancer. Despite well defined morphological features in BilIN, the molecular alterations seen during early tumor progression in the biliary tract are poorly understood.","1299":"HPV-induced alterations of the uterine cervix are frequently biopsied because of suspicious findings on a Pap smear and\/or colposcopy. Precancerous lesions occur at the so called transformation zone. For those representing squamous differentiation, the traditional three-tier grading system in CIN 1 to 3 is used. CIN 1 and CIN 2 represent (spontaneous) regression in 60-90% and 50%, respectively. In CIN 3 lesions progression is seen in 20-50%. For appropriate grading, improvement of inter- and intraobserver correlation as well as the exclusion of non-precancerous lesions, p16 immunohistochemistry might be helpful. The terms endocervical glandular dysplasia and low-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia have been suggested for glandular lesions less than adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). Until now reproducible histological criteria have not been established. Additional studies using HPV analysis, p16 and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry have not been proved for these lesions. In accordance with international consensus meetings, these diagnostic terms are not recommended for use in practice. AIS, characterised by the replacement of glandular epithelium by cytologically malignant cells, has been established as the precancerous lesion of the endocervix. AIS is much less common than CIN 3 with a reported range of 1:50-100. But, AIS is found in association with CIN 3 with 25-75%. The differential diagnosis between AIS and non-neoplastic glandular lesion may be aided by immunohistochemistry (e.g. p16, Ki-67, bcl-2, vimentin). All specimens obtained after the clinical diagnosis of cervical precancerous lesions should be examined using step sectioning to rule out microinvasive growth. Important information for clinicians includes the quality of the specimen (cautery artefacts, transformation zone enclosed within the probe), exact grading of CIN lesions, identification of other lesions responsible for suspicious findings of a Pap smear or at colposcopy, and in the case of conisation the distance of the lesion from the resection margins (endo- and ectocervical and circumferential margin).","1300":"Carcinoma in situ (CIS), also known as intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified, is the common obligate precursor lesion of malignant testicular seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (GCT), which show a steadily increasing incidence in Europe. Although GCT is a potentially curable cancer with excellent prognosis even in patients with organ metastasis, many patients suffer from chemotherapy-associated effects and some develop a secondary (non-germ cell) malignancy. Recently, genome-wide association studies revealed genetic predispositions linked to six genes (KITL, SPRY4, BAK1, TERT, ATF7IP, DMRT1). Exposure to environmental factors was also linked to increased prevalence of testicular dysgenesis and CIS\/GCT by the action of hormone disruptors on embryonal gonadal tissue during pregnancy. By unknown mechanisms these genetic and environmental factors might create a disturbed microenvironment in the fetal testis leading to survival of embryonic germ cells and subsequent malignant transformation might result in CIS. Molecular pathways involved in this process include activated cKIT pathway and LIN28 associated deregulation of miRNA targets. The challenge for the future is to identify high risk patients prior to invasive GCT, to develop non-invasive tests for detection of CIS on seminal material and elucidate the precise role of the microenvironment in CIS initiation.","1301":"","1302":"Due to their infrequency, diagnosis of salivary gland tumors remains a challenge for the practicing pathologist with respect to subtyping, grading and estimating patient prognosis. In a 3 center collaborative study of 288 cases with clinical follow-up information, it could be demonstrated that apart from clinical parameters like high patient's age, male sex and high tumor stage, the application of a 3-tiered grading system incorporating the histological tumor type is of high prognostic relevance. In immunohistochemical and molecular analyses overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), high expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), amplification and gains of EGFR and HER2, absent expression of C-KIT, loss of maspin and of O(6)-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) as well as MGMT promoter methylation turned out to be negative prognostic factors. In mucoepidermoid carcinomas the presence of a translocation t(11;19) was less relevant than recognizing different subtypes (classical type, eosinophilic, clear-cell and squamoid variants). Acinic cell carcinoma with mixed acinar-ductular differentiation as judged by expression of CK7 was characterized by a higher frequency of early relapse. The presented results underline the pathologist's role in the diagnosis and management of patients with salivary gland carcinomas.","1303":"","1304":"Since early February 2010 we have been implementing the latest version of the 2009 AJCC Melanoma Staging and Classification in our institution. Since, according to the guidelines for stage pT1 melanomas, the number of mitoses\/mm(2) is of particular significance, we have been able to observe a notable shift from pT1a to pT1b. Highlighting the mitotic count as one of the key features of the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, we observed that the major part of stage-switched melanomas belonged to a minimally invasive subset of melanomas previously categorized as pT1a UICC (7(th) edition). A level of reasonable doubt remains regarding the distinct histogenetic classification of mitosis as early stage melanoma with regard to their epithelial or melanocytic origin.","1305":"Carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause the majority of cervical cancers and other anogenital cancers. Large randomized trials have shown that HPV testing can be efficiently used for primary cervical cancer screening. Other applications include the triage of abnormal cytology results and the follow-up of women after treatment. Many assays have been developed to measure DNA, RNA and proteins of HPV and the various tests can have very different applications. It is important to rigorously validate HPV assays before they are implemented in screening or clinical care.","1306":"A kidney biopsy is an important and frequently used diagnostic tool in routine nephrology. In order to obtain relevant clinical information from a renal biopsy close cooperation between clinicians and pathologists is mandatory. The better the information obtained from nephrologists and the better the understanding by nephrologists and the quality of the kidney biopsy, the more rewarding is the information from pathologists. The following paper will discuss some practical aspects regarding the interaction between nephrology and pathology which may not be known or poorly handled and may thus cause misunderstanding. In order to facilitate interaction between clinicians and pathologists some guidelines concerning the procedure and work-up of routine kidney biopsies have been established and will be discussed in detail.","1307":"Non-serrated precursor lesions of colorectal tumours include conventional adenomas (tubular, tubulovillous and villous), inflammatory bowel disease-associated dysplasia (intraepithelial neoplasia), and hamartoma-associated dysplasia. This short review summarizes the current literature on the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, focusing on colonic stem cells and functional crypt organization, patterns of stem cell division, niche succession and clonal conversion in the formation of a monocryptal adenoma. The process of clonal interaction between neighboring crypts as well as the development of large monoclonal adenomas from small polyclonal precursor lesions is discussed in detail. Finally, the molecular pathogenesis as well as the clinical significance of inflammatory bowel disease- and hamartoma-associated carcinogenesis is addressed.","1308":"","1309":"For many tumors the early detection of precursor lesions of invasive cancer has an impact on the clinical course. The high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) is the only accepted facultative precursor lesion for acinar prostate cancer. While HG-PIN shows many similarities to prostate cancer it is most probably not a precursor of every prostate cancer variant. However, the detection of HG-PIN in needle biopsies is a significant risk factor for the subsequent diagnosis of invasive prostate cancer. Low-grade PIN (LG-PIN), proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia are no longer considered to be true precursor lesions.","1310":"","1311":null,"1312":"A variety of somatic genetic and epigenetic aberrations are discussed in the multistep carcinogenesis of tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract but specific genetic changes are still unknown. Primary prevention of cancer is important and includes the control of causal endo- and exogenous factors. Screening endoscopies to detect premalignant lesions or early carcinoma cannot be recommended in the Western world. The incidence of preinvasive neoplasia, above all the high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, in Barrett's esophagus or stomach is as low as 4.0 or 0.6%, respectively. Secondary prevention of cancer after changes of the mucosa should be performed by endoscopic diagnosis and treatment performing biopsies or resection of the lesion. After histological diagnosis of a high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, complete resection of these lesions including complete ablation of Barrett's mucosa should be carried out. On the basis of an exact pathological report, close cooperation between endoscopist and surgeon seems to be necessary to find out the best individual therapy with curative intent.","1313":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are an important cell type for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. They are involved in tissue regeneration by means of: (a) differentiation into specialised mesodermal cells and (b) their biosynthetic activity that is both immunomodulatory and trophic. In recent studies we analysed MSC in contact with different biomaterials to identify suitable combinations for tissue engineering. A biomaterial test platform was established to analyse cell adhesion, viability, proliferation, cytotoxicity according to ISO 10993-5, apoptosis and differentiation to adipocytes and osteoblasts on a variety of polymers (degradable biopolymers, degradable synthetic polymers, non-degradable synthetic polymers, shape memory polymers, and ceramics). Using this platform, biomaterials which support MSC growth by maintaining their stem cell characteristics and support the differentiation of MSC towards mature osteoblasts were identified. Furthermore, we showed that MSC possess fibrinolytic capacities and perform extracellular matrix remodelling. The data support the theory that MSC are involved in tissue regeneration both via their differentiation capacity and their trophic characteristics. We identified different MSC\/biomaterial combinations which are suitable for stem cell-based bone tissue engineering. ","1314":"A lack of correlation of cytological diagnoses with subsequent histological tissue diagnoses in cervical pathology is caused by either sampling or by interpretation errors. The term sampling error refers to both obtaining cytological material by a cervical smear as well as obtaining tissue samples by surgical procedures such as biopsy or conization. The term interpretation error refers to a lack of correlation as a consequence of the subjective variability in the diagnostic evaluation of cytological, histological or colposcopic findings. This so-called interobserver variability is well known and of considerable significance. Cytological-histological correlation is an important and mandatory method of quality assurance in the cytology laboratory. Lack of correlation can be crucial for the patient because of possible over treatment or under treatment. It can also undermine the relationship between cytopathologists and clinicians. It is therefore crucial to recognize the sources of error presented in this review and to make an effort to resolve discordances by communication and second review.","1315":"","1316":"","1317":"Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and bile duct carcinomas (BDC) have a poor prognosis since they are often detected at advanced stages and respond poorly to adjuvant therapy. Serum markers (e.g. AFP, CA19-9, etc.) can be used for early detection of these tumours but have only moderate sensitivity and specificity. The Golgi-associated protein GOLPH2 was found in the tissue and serum of patients with HCC and CCC and might be used to detect these tumours in time. The biopsy still remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of HCC and CCC. When biopsies are taken from these tumours they are often fragmented and contain reactive changes. Therefore immunohistochemical markers can aid in excluding or ascertaining malignancy. Studies have shown that the oncofetal protein \"IGF-II mRNA-binding protein 3\" (IMP3), the cell adhesion molecules P-cadherin and CD24, the cancer testis antigen MAGE-C2\/CT-10 as well as the protein periostin can be used as tissue markers in the diagnosis of HCC and CCC.","1318":"Ovarian carcinomas consist of a heterogeneous group of malignant epithelial neoplasms with specific pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides a brief introduction to the different pathways of tumor progression and the associated molecular changes. However, the main focus will be on two areas with major paradigm shifting developments in recent years. Mutational analysis of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, endometrioid carcinomas and endometriotic lesions identified mutations in the ARID1A gene as common and early genetic changes in carcinomas with associated endometriosis and in atypical endometriosis itself. Extensive pathological work-up of the fallopian tubes of BRCA1\/2 mutation carriers have demonstrated the existence of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC). Further studies showed that this lesion can also be found in 50-60% of patients with serous ovarian carcinomas without BRCA1\/2 germline mutations. Pre-precursors which share the p53 mutations with STICs but proliferate very little are called p53-signatures and provide conclusive evidence that STICs develop in the fallopian tubes.","1319":"","1320":"Significant reasons militate for the implementation of clinical autopsies: On the part of physicians and nurses, there is quality assurance, establishment of legal certainty regarding possible accusations of medical errors and development of treatment methods. On the part of patients and their relatives, there is consolation and relief in cases of unexpected death, insight into genetic dispositions and insurance law concerns, to name only a few. However, a continuing decrease of clinical autopsies can be observed in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. The thesis asserting that the often required informed consent of the deceased during his\/her lifetime or of close relatives is a crucial reason for this decrease needs to be called into question due to recent studies. Mainsprings are rather structural reasons, such as the often deficient communication with the patient or close relatives, economic reasons, namely the frequently insufficient remuneration for the clinical autopsy, organizational causes, in particular the repeatedly encountered suboptimal collaboration between the individual departments and the pathology department, the high administrative effort and probably the decreasing appreciation of the clinical autopsy.","1321":"Infectious lymphadenitis is often biopsied in the differential diagnoses of malignant disease. Since the repertoire of lymph nodes which react to exogenous stimuli is limited, malignant lymphomas may enter the clinical and morphological differential diagnosis. In a morphological sense, infectious lymphadenitis is defined as an infection of lymph node tissue. Therefore, the effector phase of the inflammatory reaction will act against lymphatic tissue, in contrast to common physiological hyperplasia. Follicular reactions, in addition to follicular hyperplasia, are seen in HIV-associated lymphadenopathy. Other viruses, such as infectious mononucleosis, give rise to a cytotoxic T-cell reaction. Most infections, however, induce a histiocytic reaction; depending on the microorganism, this varies morphologically from a small clustered epithelioid cell reaction or histiocytic abscesses to epithelioid necrotizing granulomata.","1322":"Human cytomegalovirus, a double-stranded DNA virus, is a member of the Herpesviridae family with high rates of transmission. Primary infection is often asymptomatic and leads to life-long latency. Reactivation may induce different organ manifestations, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression. Histopathologically, the virus can be detected by light microscopy. Different cell populations in different organs are transformed into\"owl's eye\" cells, which are pathognomonic. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy can be applied as complementary methods. Various PCR approaches in molecular pathology including nested PCR, capture probe ELISA-PCR and real time PCR confer HCMV tests high sensitivity and specificity. The present article discusses the methods of pathological diagnostic approaches and describes organ manifestations of HCMV.","1323":"MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotides short, non-protein-coding RNA molecules, which bind semi-complementary to mRNA and have an inhibitory effect on protein expression. Aberrant microRNA expression is part of the molecular pathological damage in several degenerative, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases and deregulation can also be virus-associated. Apart from intracellular regulatory functions, microRNA in platelets and exosomes or bound to extracellular protein complexes can also circulate in the blood. Artificial microRNA analogues (small interference RNA\/siRNA) and anti-microRNA (antagomir) are used in molecular pathological research of microRNA\/mRNA interaction and it is thought that they will also be used as therapeutic agents in the future.","1324":"The seven basic patterns of inflammatory dermatoses according to Ackerman can be applied to infectious dermatoses. However, it should be borne in mind that infection caused by one agent may induce differing patterns according to the stage of disease. Dermatophytosis and the arthropod reaction belong to perivascular dermatoses with spongiosis. Secondary syphilis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans regularly show a lichenoid infiltrate with interface dermatitis, whereas epidermal involvement is typically absent in erythema migrans, virus exanthema and bacillary angiomatosis. Lupus vulgaris, atypic mycobacteriosis, lepra, actinomycosis, cutaneous leishmaniosis and erysipelas belong to the nodular and diffuse dermatoses. In the group of vasculitides, septic vasculitis is induced by a biological agent, and the pattern of vesicular dermatitis is reflected by infections with herpes viruses, impetigo contagiosa and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. Follicular dermatitis shows a pattern of furuncles and carbuncles which are mainly caused by bacteria or fungi.","1325":"JC and BK viruses are strains of the polyomavirus group with pathogenic potential in humans. BK is the most frequent pathogenic agent of polyomavirus nephropathy (BKVN) in kidney transplant patients, which is only exceptionally caused by JC virus. Asymptomatic BK virus infection is often acquired in childhood and the virus persists in urothelium and kidneys of healthy individuals, where it can be reactivated under immunosuppression. Up to 10% of transplanted kidneys are affected by BKVN, while the risk of transplant failure due to BKVN exceeds 50% in some publications. In kidney biopsies BKVN leads to tubulointerstitial nephritis, which may be difficult to distinguish from acute cellular rejection without additional use of immunohistochemistry for a polyomavirus antigen. Typical hallmarks of BKVN include cytopathic effects caused by the virus with cell lysis, denudation of tubular basement membranes and nuclear inclusion bodies. An early diagnosis is essential for transplant survival, making screening of blood and urine for BK virus after kidney transplantation part of the standard care of renal transplant patients today. In the case of significant viremia or biopsy-proven BKVN immunosuppression is reduced to allow clearing of the virus.","1326":"Classic rabies is a progressive and lethal infectious disease of animals, which may be transmitted to humans. Inter-human infections are extremely rare. The present case describes transmittal of rabies virus by lung transplantation from an infected donor. Histologically, a lymphocytic encephalomyelitis with neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies was found. Immunohistochemically, rabies virus antigen was detected in the central, autonomous and peripheral nervous system. By means of electron microscopy, virions were demonstrated in the brain. A central task of health care in transplantations is the detection of uncommon infectious agents and the prevention of their transmittal.","1327":"Heterotopic gastric mucosa is a rare finding in the rectum. Apart from two other hypotheses, a misdifferentiation of entodermal stem cells is the most widely accepted aetiopathogenetic assumption today. Due to acid secretion, the lesions predominantly manifest with hematochezia. Therapeutic options include medicinal therapy and particularly (endoscopic) removal. From the pathologist's point of view a careful evaluation is required also in terms of basically possible dysplastic or malignant changes.","1328":"Biopsies and resection specimens of the gastrointestinal tract are a major part of the routine workload in many histopathology departments, whereby polypoid lesions are generally the main focus. In addition to distinguishing non-neoplastic from neoplastic polyps and evaluating the grade of dysplasia of the latter, the pathologist should always consider the possibility of an underlying polyposis syndrome. Not only have additional hereditary polyposis syndromes been identified in recent years due to a better understanding of their genetic and epigenetic alterations but also knowledge on well known polyposes has improved, leading to subtyping of various forms according to their different genotype. It is essential for the histopathologist to understand that the conventional histomorphology of individual polyps combined with information on the number and distribution of these lesions and clinical data can provide clues regarding a possible hereditary background. Therefore, the correct histological assessment of polyps is not just about getting the diagnosis right, it might also lead to genetic screening of family members and spouses.","1329":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides an important treatment option for patients who, as a consequence of colorectal cancer, have developed liver metastases. Regression of metastases prior to surgery may substantially improve prognosis. However, chemotherapeutics may harm non-tumorous liver tissue, particularly if this is already impaired prior to chemotherapy. The present article discusses the risks of chemotherapeutics for liver tissue-including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis, amongst others-which should be borne in mind when selecting therapy.","1330":"Tumors of the anal canal are mostly epithelial in origin. The transition of gland-forming rectal mucosa via specialized urothelium-like cells at the dentate line to anal non-keratinized and finally perianal keratinized squamous epithelium implies a broad spectrum of tumor types, with most cancers exhibiting a mixture of different histological features. Moreover, secondary neoplasias extending into or metastasizing to the anal region need to be considered. Based on epithelial metaplasia at the transformation zone, poorly differentiated squamous anal carcinomas may show co-expression of both the squamous (CK5\/6) and glandular type keratins (CK7). Since HPV infection of high-risk types (often 16 and 18) is etiologically associated with anal cancer, p16(INK4a) is highly sensitive and specific in the detection of high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasias (ASIN) and corresponding invasive squamous carcinomas. Diagnosis of secondary malignancies, including pagetoid extension into the anogenital region, requires the application of specific immunohistochemical marker panels.","1331":"Ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor of the anterior tongue is a rare entity. To date, 37 cases have been reported in the literature. We present the case of a 52-year-old male patient with an ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor at the typical location with a characteristic lobular proliferation of ovoid and fusiform uniform tumor cells on a chondromyxoid background and showing expression of typical immunohistochemical markers GFAP and S-100. Despite its rarity, this special tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis when dealing with localized swellings of the anterior tongue.","1332":"Gastroenterologists removing colorectal polyps expect standardized and well-structured pathological reports, providing them with all relevant data for the further clinical management of the patient. Over the last year, a task force of clinicians and pathologists has developed a checklist to improve and harmonize endoscopic and pathological reporting of colorectal polyps. This checklist concentrates more on concrete recommendations from evidence-based guidelines and established international classifications for daily practice rather than detailed molecular pathological pathways of carcinogenesis. These recommendations are based on the current S3 guidelines for colorectal cancer (the chapter entitled \"Management of colorectal polyps\"), the histomorphological consensus manuscript of the GI working group of the German Society for Pathology, as well as the current WHO classification for tumors of the digestive system.","1333":"","1334":null,"1335":null,"1336":"Polypoid dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is categorized as DALM (dysplasia associated lesion or mass) or ALM (adenoma-like mass). DALMs are etiologically related to the underlying inflammatory disease, have a high risk of cancer and remain an indication for colectomy. Sporadic adenomas occur coincidentally according to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. They are adequately treated by polypectomy. More recently, a special group of lesions has been termed as \"adenoma-like DALM\" which shows a morphological overlap with sporadic adenomas in spite of arising against the background of chronic IBD. Adenoma-like DALMs may possess a lower risk of malignancy in contrast to non-adenoma-like DALMs. They may be treated adequately by polypectomy and continued monitoring if the lesion has been excised completely and there is no evidence of flat dysplasia elsewhere in the colon.","1337":"Total mesorectal excision (TME) refers to the anatomically accurate surgical resection of the rectum from its surrounding fascias and has become the gold standard for treating rectal cancer. The pathologist plays a key role in the assessment of these specimens and good pathological reporting of rectal cancer is essential to achieving the optimum possible results for patients with rectal cancer. In experienced hands, these techniques result in a dramatic improvement in cancer-related cure rates from 45% to 75% and a reduction in pelvic recurrences from 40% to 5%-10%. Moreover, preservation of sexual and urinary functions is possible in the majority of cases. This article reviews the pathological assessment of the TME specimen in detail with regards to current international guidelines and describes its anatomical background. In addition, particular issues relating to margins, lymph node dissection and effects of neoadjuvant therapy are discussed.","1338":null,"1339":"Non-neoplastic and non-hamartomatous colorectal polyps or tumor-like lesions comprise a very heterogeneous group of changes in the colorectal mucosa or the colon wall. Mucosal prolapse-associated lesions and inflammatory polyps, which are predominantly associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, are the most prominent examples for polypoid lesions difficult to distinguish from neoplastic lesions such as adenomas, hyperplastic\/serrated polyps\/adenomas and invasive carcinomas. The considerably less frequent tumor-like lesions like heterotopias, endometriosis, amyloid tumors and pseudolipomatous changes are histologically often well defined and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of colorectal lesions. The etiology, endoscopic and histological appearance of these entities and their most important differential diagnoses are discussed.","1340":"Pathologists are well acquainted with the histopathologic features of a vital tubal pregnancy; however, tubal pregnancy successfully treated with medication is seen much less often, since these patients do not usually undergo surgery. We report a rare case of this type, in which no trophoblast tissue was found at histopathologic examination. Intratubal granulation tissue represented the remaining non-vital pregnancy tissue.","1341":"","1342":"The number of hospital autopsies has been declining for many years-in Germany as well as in other western countries. One possible reason for this could be the public's negative view of autopsies. Therefore, a representative survey was conducted to study the attitudes of the German population on postmortem examinations. In total, 84% of respondents generally accept hospital autopsies, while only 10% are in principle opposed to this practice. Many respondents (72%) would agree to the autopsy of their own dead body and 65% to the autopsy of relatives. Altogether, 9% of respondents had already been in a situation where a relative had died in a hospital and they were asked for permission to perform an autopsy. Of these 90, 56% agreed to and 44% refused autopsy. The data suggest that the attitudes of the public are surprisingly positive and do not explain declining autopsy rates. Medical and institutional reasons must be considered instead as the possible cause of declining autopsy rates. ","1343":"Prosthesis durability has steadily increased with high 10-year rates of 88-95%. However, four pathogenetic groups of diseases can decrease prosthesis durability: (1) periprosthetic wear particle disease (aseptic loosening) (2) bacterial infection (septic loosening) (3) periprosthetic ossification, and (4) arthrofibrosis. The histopathological \"extended consensus classification of periprosthetic membranes\" includes four types of membranes, arthrofibrosis, and osseous diseases of endoprosthetics: The four types of neosynovia are: wear particle-induced type (type I), mean prosthesis durability (MPD) in years 12.0; infectious type (type II), MPD 2.5; combined type (type III) MPD 4.2; and indeterminate type (type IV), MPD 5.5. Arthrofibrosis can be determined in three grades: grade 1 needs clinical information to be differentiated from a type IV membrane, and grades 2 &amp; 3 can be diagnosed histopathologically. Periprosthetic ossification, osteopenia-induced fractures, and aseptic osteonecrosis can be histopathologically diagnosed safely with clinical information. The extended consensus classification of periprosthetic membranes may be a diagnostic groundwork for a future national endoprosthesis register.","1344":"Crystal arthropathies represent a heterogenic group of skeletal diseases associated with the deposition of mineralised material within joints and periarticular soft tissues. Gout is the most common and pathogenetically best understood crystal arthropathy, followed by basic calcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition diseases, and, in very rare cases, calcium oxalate crystal arthropathy. These crystals are responsible for different rheumatic syndromes, including acute or chronic synovial inflammation, and also contribute to cartilage degeneration. This review gives an overview of the pathological and clinical changes of these arthropathies.","1345":"Menisci fulfill many functions within the complex biomechanics of the knee joint. In the case of meniscus lesions, sparing arthroscopic resection and surgical refixation are the treatments of choice. In terms of diagnosis, this means in general that histopathologic diagnostics are carried out on detached meniscus fragments of between 5 mm and 2 cm in size. A good knowledge of physiologically possible cellular and fibrous histological meniscus damage, as opposed to nonphysiological change regarded as normal with respect to age, is essential for diagnostic meniscus evaluation. The clinician expects clear statements from the pathologist regarding the severity of previous or secondary degenerative meniscus damage, the age and type of traumatic tears, and an appraisal of the relationship between trauma and meniscus damage from an insurance point of view. Close cooperation between the clinician and the pathologist allows for a fast and unambiguous correlation of anamnesis, the clinical picture, and morphological reporting such that problematic insurance cases can be clarified quickly.","1346":"Degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system, in particular osteoarthritis, are among the most common diseases of the elderly and their importance in an aging society is continuously increasing. Correspondingly, many surgical interventions are undertaken and pathological specimens submitted for histopathologic workup. The pathophysiology of osteoarthritis, which ultimately leads to joint destruction, is still poorly understood. The question remains as to whether the cause lies (mainly) within the chondrocytes themselves (e.g. cellular aging\/senescence) or whether the synovial membrane or the subchondral bone are equally or even more important factors. The process of joint destruction can be evaluated in terms of pathogenesis (typing), extent (staging) and degree of the most extensive focal damage (grading). Because of the heterogeneity of the disease and substantial individual differences in progression, classification and grading of cartilage degeneration represents a complex task. Any pathology report should be concise and delineate only the essential features. Differentiating between primary osteoarthritis and secondary degenerative changes, e.g., due to previously unknown rheumatoid disease, bone necrosis or an infection of the joint, is of particular clinical interest.","1347":"Expert opinions on the musculoskeletal system are generally required for statutory or private accident insurance purposes in a variety of legal areas and with varying rules of evidence. Since they are also intended for non-medical personnel, terminology needs to be defined and must be comprehensible by all parties. Bradytrophic tissue is the most frequently evaluated aspect of the musculoskeletal system. In this context, the term\"degeneration\" which was formerly used has been replaced by the term\"tissue structure alteration\", which takes matrix changes and cellularity into consideration. Thus the significance of histopathological diagnosis of bradytrophic tissue has been put in a new light. Histopathological diagnosis is carried out on the basis of various staining methods, scores and analyses depending on the diagnostic question.","1348":"Bacterial infection of the bone is a severe disease with complications, potentially including long-term physical disability. The diagnosis and therapy of osteomyelitis include several elements: histopathology, microbiology, radiologic imagining, as well as antibiotic and surgical therapy. Histopathologists differentiate between acute osteomyelitis (infiltration of cancellous bone with neutrophil granulocytes); specific osteomyelitis (epithelioid-like granulomatous inflammation, tuberculosis, mycotic infections); primary\/secondary chronic osteomyelitis (lymphocytic infiltration); and special forms of chronic osteomyelitis (varying histomorphology, Brodie abscess, SAPHO syndrome). Another important task in the histopathological diagnosis of inflammatory bone diseases is to differentiate osteomyelitis from malignant entities (sarcoma, lymphoma). Therefore, biopsy samples should be of sufficient size for safe diagnosis. Clinical information and imaging as well as interdisciplinary teamwork between radiologists, microbiologists, orthopedic surgeons and pathologists is mandatory to verify these diagnoses.","1349":"","1350":"","1351":"The past decade has seen substantial improvements in patient and graft survival after intestinal transplantation. This improvement has been achieved by advances in donor and recipient selection, patient management, immunosuppression and surgical techniques. Intestinal transplantation is therefore considered a therapeutic option in the treatment of short bowel syndrome. Mile stones include the development of the calcineurin inhibitor Tacrolimus for immunosuppression as well as induction therapy using immune modulating substances like interleukin-2 receptor antagonists and antilymphocyte preparations. In addition to improvements in immunosuppression, antimicrobial prophylaxis and diagnosis of rejection, advances in surgical techniques have been crucial to achieving increased graft survival. Pancreas transplantation, generally with simultaneous kidney transplantation, is now available as a treatment option for patients with labile diabetes mellitus (usually type 1). Allogeneic islet transplantation was developed in the 1990s as a minimally invasive alternative to pancreas transplantation. Pancreatic islets are isolated enzymatically from the donor pancreas, in most cases infused into the portal vein and thus engrafted into the liver. Currently, technical and medical problems as well as high costs prevent the application of islet transplantation as a therapeutic option for a larger number of patients with diabetes mellitus.","1352":"","1353":"Lung transplantation is the ultimate therapeutical approach for the treatment of both children and adults with terminal congenital or acquired lung disease. In contrast to survival rates during the first year following transplantation, the long-term survival for patients after lung transplantation has not significantly improved in the past. In addition to other complications, acute cellular rejection constitutes a major cause for diminished function of pulmonary grafts, and can, among other factors, be causative for chronic rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, BOS). In 2006, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) provided a revised version of the grading system for acute and chronic rejection of pulmonary grafts.","1354":"Transplantation of solid organs and haematopoietic stem cells requires immunosuppressive drug therapy in order to prevent rejection or graft-versus-host disease. Depending on dosage and type of drug, the risk of developing an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is increased. The lesion spectrum ranges from hyperplastic lesions to manifest lymphomas, the latter being classified as monomorphic PTLD. Hyperplastic changes, which are not distinguishable from viral reactions, comprise early or mononucleosis-like lesions. Those with effaced lymph node architecture or extranodal manifestation without a lymphoma-like phenotype are designated polymorphic PTLD. Monomorphic PTLD are either high grade B cell lymphomas, plasma cell neoplasms or Hodgkin lymphomas and only very rarely T cell lymphomas. Low grade B cell lymphomas do not occur. In a subfraction of cases, including even monomorphic PTLD, reduction of immunosuppression alone is sufficient to induce remission of the pathological process.","1355":"Biopsy of the transplanted kidney plays an important role in the care and treatment of patients after kidney transplantation. Today the renal biopsy is a standard procedure which is performed early after renal transplantation in the case of a primary non-functioning graft or a significant rise in serum creatinine. On the other hand, a kidney biopsy is performed if an acute or creeping rise in serum creatinine or acute onset of proteinuria or erythrocyturia is observed during follow-up. Furthermore, zero biopsies or intraoperative biopsies of the graft are important in order to obtain information about the initial quality of the graft. This is particularly important in view of the shortage of donor organs and the resulting necessity to accept increasingly marginal organs, such as for example in the ESP program. In addition, an increasing number of transplant centres perform protocol biopsies, i.e. biopsies that are not based on clinical indication, but are performed at a certain time point after transplantation to detect subclinical rejections as well as histological alterations pointing to chronic allograft damage. Additionally, there is much scientific interest in protocol biopsies.","1356":"Since the first heart transplantation in 1967, the procedure has become an established therapy in the treatment of terminal heart failure. Constant advances in the development of potent immunosuppressive drugs, as well as greater clinical experience and pathological diagnostics have improved patient survival dramatically. The first grading system for rejection was published in 1990 by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and revised in 2004. The 2004 grading system comprises three grades of severity (1R, 2R, 3R), whereby the former grade 2 in the 1990 system has been incorporated in the new grade 1R. Recommendations are made for the histological diagnosis of acute antibody-mediated rejection using immunohistochemical staining against C4d and macrophages. To the present day, the pathological examination of endomyocardial biopsies remains the gold standard for post-transplant diagnostic procedures. Whether or not non-invasive diagnostic approaches (e.g. gene array profile analysis on leukocytes) can replace morphological investigations needs to be clarified in randomised, prospective clinical studies.","1357":"Infections play a crucial role in organ transplantations as possible complications. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites are potential agents. The relevance of individual diseases depends on the organ transplanted. Morphology of the inflammatory reaction is given by the agent involved, but often several reactions can be caused by the same agent and different agents can also lead to the same reaction. Histology therefore provides concrete identification of the causal agent only in some cases, such that additional microbiological diagnostics are necessary. Results from these investigations should be transferred to the pathologist to distinguish between infection-associated changes and transplant rejection.","1358":"Negative surgical margins (R0 resection) play a key role in the prevention of local recurrences of soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities in the multimodal therapy concept. The prognostic relevance for long-term survival is still under dispute. Despite the fact that numerous recommendations and guidelines have existed for over 100 years, strong evidence-based data from prospective randomized studies are still not available today. These studies should include parameters like tumor localization, subtype and biological aggressiveness. Recommendations as to surgical therapy diverge considerably. They range from amputation and compartment resection to centimetre and millimetre surgical margins. The present article analyses currently available data and definitions and discusses the impact on functional restriction, lymph drainage, local recurrence and the perioperative irradiation field. In the absence of surgical standards, it is doubtful whether existing studies and multicenter trials currently underway are valid. Close co-operation between surgeon and pathologist is imperative to further substantiate the significance of histological examinations and resection margins.","1359":"This review reports the main gene signature specific for the diagnosis, prognosis or prediction of drug response in sarcomas. Almost half of sarcomas show a simple genetic lesion which is specific for the diagnosis: recurrent translocations in 10 to 15% of sarcomas, specific activating and inactivating mutations in GIST and rhabdoid tumor respectively, and MDM2 amplification in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas as well as in intimal sarcoma. A recent study reported a gene expression signature which is much better than histological grading for predicting metastasis outcome. This signature is composed of 67 genes all belonging to pathways involved in chromosome integrity suggesting an important role of these mechanisms in the development of metastases. On the other hand, and except for GIST with KIT and PDGFRA mutations, there is no validated predictive gene signature so far.","1360":"Liver allograft pathology continues to play an important role in the diagnosis and management of complications in the course of liver transplantation. This article summarizes important patterns of liver damage and also considers new aspects of transplant pathology from the literature. In the context of transplant rejection, late cellular rejection has aroused new interest. Histopathological changes in late rejection differ from acute cellular rejection and there seem to be similarities to de novo autoimmune hepatitis and idiopathic post-transplant hepatitis. Central perivenulitis is a typical change in late cellular rejection and should be differentiated from central toxic necrosis. Other important areas of transplant pathology include vascular and biliary changes resulting from surgical complications or as sequelae of immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, disease recurrence plays an important role and combined patterns of disease poses a challenge for the pathologist.","1361":"Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) occurs as a major complication in 35%-50% of all patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A distinction is made between acute and chronic GvHD depending on the time of onset, type of clinical symptoms and histology. Both forms preferably show manifestations in the skin, mucosal membranes, gastrointestinal tract, liver and (less often) lung. As the clinical presentation is rather unspecific, particularly for the diagnosis of acute GvHD, histology is important to exclude infectious diseases or drug reactions. This review covers the diagnostic morphological criteria and differential diagnoses of GvHD in the skin, gastrointestinal tract and the liver.","1362":"The conceptual evolution in the classification of pleomorphic high-grade sarcomas is a paradigm of how the integrative morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analysis has contributed to a clinical, prognostic and therapy-oriented characterization of this complex group of tumors. The clinical and prognostic relevance of a refined subtyping of pleomorphic high-grade sarcomas, which until recently was considered a mere academic exercise, is now undisputed. It is imperative to unequivocally differentiate sarcomas from non-sarcomatous, clearly defined malignancies to start adequate therapy. Furthermore, pleomorphic sarcomas which are particularly aggressive and prone to poor prognosis, have to be separated from sarcomas which, in contrast to the pleomorphic phenotype, are characterized by a less aggressive behavior. Also, morphologically pleomorphic but benign mesenchymal tumors must be recognized. Finally, it is important to promote the promising, array-based identification of diagnostic, prognostic and clinically relevant gene signatures on larger collections of pathomorphologically and clinically precisely defined subtypes of pleomorphic high-grade sarcomas.","1363":"","1364":"The Jena Institute of Pathology has been serving as a consultation and reference center for soft tissue tumors in Germany since 1978. The present study provides an overview of the clinicopathological data from a two-year period and an update on diagnostics and research. Retrospectively, 7043 cases sent to the institute in the years 2006 and 2007 were analyzed. The majority of cases (&gt;77.7%) were soft tissue tumors, of which 49% were categorized as malignant, 11.4% as intermediate, 35% as benign and 4.6% as tumors of uncertain biological potential. Neoplasms with fibroblastic differentiation were the most frequent. The mean age of patients with a sarcoma was 63 years. The molecular pathological analysis of soft tissue tumors has attained a major role in diagnosis. This is further advanced at the Jena institute in the context of a German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) project for molecular sarcoma diagnosis with the aim of developing and validating DNA probes for in situ hybridization detection of translocations and their associated chromosomal breaks on the one hand, and DNA chips for the detection of fusion transcripts on the other. Research projects relate to the analysis of specific biomarkers in large tumor collectives and the pathomechanisms in several sarcoma entities.","1365":"Immunohistochemical evaluation of primary and secondary (adeno-) carcinomas of the lung often includes utilisation of two different clones (8G7G3\/1 or SPT24) of TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1) antibodies. In a subgroup of adenocarcinomas with a primary site other than the lung a positive reaction of clone SPT24 and also of clone 8G7G3\/1 is described. We report on a patient with TTF-1 (clone 8G7G3\/1) positive adenocarcinoma of the colon with metastases to the eye and lung and discuss TTF-1 based diagnostic considerations.","1366":null,"1367":"Due to their rarity and multiple subtypes, there is scant experience with sarcomas. Any effective targeted therapy depends on precise diagnosis of the tumor group using molecular markers and, increasingly, mutation testing. The necessary histopathological expertise and molecular diagnostic tools are usually only found at specialized centers. Using the Bonner GIST register as an example, the advantages of this kind of register from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective will be discussed. Material submitted for gastrointestinal stromal tumors and other mesenchymal tumors, as well as the supervision of pathological referencing for national and international studies have made accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy strategies ever more possible. The introduction of epidemiological as well as interdisciplinary sarcoma registers is a prerequisite for the improvement of sarcoma diagnostics and therapy.","1368":"Soft tissue swelling represents a common clinical sign of a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Sarcoma is rarely a cause. Fine needle biopsy as a minimally invasive, economic and accurate method is well suited for the diagnosis of inflammatory\/infectious processes as well as of recurrent and metastatic disease. Cytologic diagnosis of primary soft tissue tumors is also feasible. It requires close collaboration with other medical disciplines and incorporation of clinical, radiological and morphologic findings. Clinical data such as age, gender, size and topography are important parameters. The differentiation of cells and properties of the extracellular matrix supplies clues for the differential diagnosis and forms the starting point for immunohistochemical or molecular analysis (FISH, RT-PCR). This analysis may be performed on cytological smears, paraffin embedded material of the cell blocks or on frozen material.","1369":"The gold standard for the treatment of primary, resectable, high-grade soft tissue sarcomas is complete surgical removal followed by radiotherapy. In cases where preservation of function is not possible, preoperative treatment options should be considered. Systemic therapy is the treatment of choice for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas. The most active single agents include the anthracyclines doxorubicin and epirubicin, as well as ifosfamide. While combination chemotherapy yields higher response rates, this is at the cost of increased toxicity with no evidence of prolonged overall survival. Current treatment strategies focus on the development of specific treatments for well defined soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. The first and highly successful targeted therapy was seen with the introduction of imatinib in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","1370":"Calciphylaxis is a rare disease which has been increasingly reported in recent decades and has consequently shifted into the focus of clinical and scientific research. The clinical picture is characterized by extensive ischemic ulcerations of the skin and subcutis. Histologically, the small vessels in these lesions show prominent calcifications. Due to the extensive areas of ulceration and necrosis as well as frequently present comorbidities, patients with calciphylaxis are prone to infection and sepsis. In this work, we describe the case of a female kidney-transplant patient with vasculitis who, despite good graft function, developed a fulminant calciphylaxis of both thighs 4 years post transplantation and died of septic complications. The differential diagnoses as well as clinical procedures are described in detail in the case history. In the discussion, we give an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the etiopathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic measures and clinical management of calciphylaxis.","1371":"Modern computer technology provides students with easier access to learning materials. Basic knowledge of pathological findings in organs is essential in medical education. We have produced didactic videos for teaching pathology in a clinical context in addition to regular lectures at the university. Didactic material includes macroscopic and histological findings, as well as cartoons explaining pathophysiology and clinical links. Videos can be downloaded in mv4 format as podcasts to a local hard disk or to an iPhone or iPod via iTunes University and are designed to improve classical medical literature. Analysis over 3 years of server traffic and subjective impressions by the students revealed regular use and high acceptance by users. Didactic material in clinical pathology can be successfully integrated in videos to complement lectures and practical training. Modern teaching methods in pathology make the specialty more understandable and therefore more attractive for students.","1372":"Tailgut cysts are unusual benign cystic retrorectal malformations arising from persistent remnants of the postanal gut. Malignant transformation within this dysontogenetic lesion is very uncommon. We report the rare occurrence of a neuroendocrine tumor arising in a tailgut cyst with primary liver and lymph node metastases in a 55-year-old woman. The neuroendocrine differentiation of the tumor determines the therapeutic approach and prognosis.","1373":"The use of modern molecular techniques has gained importance in the diagnosis of sarcomas in recent years. Each of the analytical methods discussed here has its unique advantages and specific requirements. Cytogenetic screening methods which provide genome-wide information depend on the availability of fresh tissue. With the aid of fluorescence in situ hybridization and RT-polymerase chain reaction, specific events such as translocations in Ewing sarcoma, synovial sarcoma or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, as well as gene amplifications in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma or radiation-induced angiosarcoma and deletions in rhabdoid tumors or well-differentiated spindle cell liposarcoma can be detected in fresh and formalin fixed tissues. Molecular methods including Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing and high resolution melting provide information about specific molecular aberrations on gene level. Here we review the most important molecular techniques currently used in sarcoma diagnosis, describe their relevance for differential diagnosis and point out specific examples.","1374":"","1375":null,"1376":"Familial diseases leading to bone tumor formation are rare. They are mainly caused by genetic alterations of cell cycle constituent genes, such as retinoblastoma syndrome (RB1) and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53), of genes involved in growth-regulating transcriptional cascades, such as enchondromatosis (PTHR1) and multiple hereditary exostoses (EXT1, EXT2) or of genes maintaining chromosomal stability, such as Rothmund-Thomson (RECQL4), Werner (WRN) and Bloom syndromes (BLM). This leads to multiple benign bone tumors, which may undergo secondary malignant transformation (enchondromatosis: enchondromas, multiple hereditary exostoses: osteochondromas) or bone sarcomas, mainly osteosarcomas, such as primary (Li-Fraumeni, Rothmund-Thomson, Werner and Bloom syndromes) or secondary manifestations (retinoblastoma syndrome) of the underlying disease. Some of these lesions also carry an increased risk for developing additional malignant diseases. In contrast to sporadically occurring similar tumors, differences in manifestation in time, topography or histology may be present which can aid in the correct recognition of the underlying syndrome.","1377":"Renal cell carcinomas occur in several hereditary tumor syndromes. These renal tumors frequently have a specific histopathological appearance which can be a sign for a hereditary cause of the disease. The genetic alterations responsible for most of these tumor syndromes were identified in recent years. Interestingly, renal cell carcinomas show specific histopathological features in each of the hereditary renal cancer syndromes. Clear cell and often cystic renal cell carcinomas occur in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), while oncocytomas and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas are found in the Birt-Hugg-Dube syndrome, often also as hybrid tumors. Well differentiated papillary carcinomas (Type 1 according to the WHO) are found in the hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma (HPRC). In contrast, poorly diffentiated papillary renal cell carcinomas (Type 2 according to the WHO) occur in combination with leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas of the skin and uterus in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome (HLRCC). The various genetic causes for these hereditary tumor syndromes open up new therapeutic possibilities, some of which are already being investigated in clinical studies.","1378":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome with the major components medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. Due to the clinical course three distinct subtypes are distinguished, MEN 2A, MEN 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. The disease is caused by germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and the localization of these mutations correlates with the onset of the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is crucial for the clinical course and outcome of the disease. It therefore has a substantial influence on the clinical management of the affected patients and their relatives. This review summarizes the morphology and clinic of MEN 2-associated tumors and their respective precursor lesions.","1379":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome, which is manifested as a variety of endocrine and non-endocrine tumours and lesions caused by specific germline mutations of the MEN1 gene, a tumour suppressor gene. The detection of these germline mutations allows the early identification of affected, possibly still asymptomatic patients. The combined use of genetic and clinical tools for the diagnosis of MEN1-associated tumours substantially improves both the course of the disease and the quality of life of affected patients. This review summarizes the relevant morphological and clinical features of MEN1-associated endocrine and non-endocrine neoplasms and lesions.","1380":"One third of colorectal carcinomas (CRC) show familial clustering of which about 5% have a monogenetic trait. Distinction between disease with and without polyposis, tumor histology and tumor spectrum in a given patient are all of diagnostic relevance. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) underlies approximately 1% of CRC characterized by rapidly forming (&gt;100) adenomas. In contrast to these about 2%-3% of CRC have a hereditary background without polyposis (HNPCC). This is the only hereditary tumour syndrome to date for which a tissue-based molecular screening test is available. Accordingly, expression analysis of mismatch repair genes (MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1, PMS2) is performed first. In the case of an equivocal result with no complete loss of expression testing of microsatellite instability (MSI) is added. In contrast to the other diseases MYH-associated polyposis (MAP) follows a recessive trait with polyp numbers usually between 15-30 adenomas and should be distinguished from attenuated forms of FAP with &lt;100 polyps in the differential diagnosis. In the case of suspected familial cancer syndrome genetic counseling is warranted in order to decide ultimately whether there is an indication for genetic testing (evidence of a germ-line mutation).","1381":"","1382":"The classification of soft tissue tumors is based on their resemblance to normal non-neoplastic tissues and provides an indication of how the tumor will behave in the further disease course. The current article presents the principles to be considered when classifying tumors into categories and discusses additional findings to be taken into account in the diagnosis. The importance of considering combinations of findings when classifying a tumor is underscored; individual (in particular immunohistochemical) findings can be misleading. A statement on the grade of malignancy of a soft tissue tumor requires its identification as a known entity, otherwise incorrect prediction of its biological behaviour is possible. The category of \"intermediate malignancy\" has been added to the categories of \"benign\" and \"malignant\", whereby locally aggressive and incidentally metastasizing tumors have been included in this new category. The staging of soft tissue tumors according to the TNM system is explained, emphasizing that one important feature compared with carcinomas is the inclusion of depth localisation and grade of malignancy.","1383":"Until recently, two major types of colorectal epithelial polyps were distinguished: the adenoma and the hyperplastic polyp. While adenomas - because of their cytological atypia - were recognized as precursor lesions for colorectal carcinoma, hyperplastic polyps were perceived as harmless lesions without any potential for malignant progression, mainly because hyperplastic polyps lack cytological atypia. Meanwhile, it is evident that the lesions formerly classified as hyperplastic represent a heterogeneous group of polyps, some of which exhibit a significant risk of neoplastic progression. These lesions show characteristic epigenetic alterations not commonly seen in colorectal adenomas and progress to colorectal carcinoma via the so-called serrated pathway (CIMP pathway). This group of polyps is comprised not only of hyperplastic polyps, but also of sessile serrated adenomas (SSA), traditional serrated adenomas (TSA) and mixed polyps, showing serrated and \"classical\" adenomatous features. In a consensus conference of the working group of gastroenterological pathology of the German Society of Pathology, standardization of nomenclature and diagnostic criteria as well as recommendations for clinical management of these serrated polyps were formulated and are presented herein.","1384":"Approximately 5% of differentiated thyroid carcinomas with follicular cell differentiation, papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and 25-30% of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are hereditary. They occur either as part of a defined syndrome or are confined to the thyroid gland. Compared to their sporadic non-hereditary counterparts hereditary thyroid carcinomas generally develop earlier and regularly show multifocal tumour growth. With the exception of familial MTC, which is preceded by neoplastic C cell hyperplasia, no precursor lesions of hereditary thyroid carcinoma are known. In strong correlation with the localisation of the germline mutation of the RET protooncogene, familial MTC shows a distinct clinical course which allows precise clinical decision-making for prophylactic thyroidectomy to prevent invasive MTC. According to current knowledge prophylactic thyroidectomy of all other types of hereditary thyroid carcinoma is not justified.","1385":"Lung carcinoma is the most frequent cause of cancer death in Germany. It is characterized by a considerable morphological complexity that has been reduced by clinicians to the distinction between small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC). Underpinned by the possibilities of more differentiated tumor therapy, the classification of lung cancer has undergone a re-evaluation, some essential developments of which are summarized in this article. SCLC and NSCLC do not only differ in gene expression and genetic alterations but also in the ploidy level: SCLC is typically hypodiploid, NSCLC often hyperdiploid\/near-triploid. Immunohistochemical analysis is meanwhile standard and includes in particular the markers p63, TTF-1, CK5\/6, CK7, CD56\/NCAM, synaptophysin, chromogranin and Ki67. A new interdisciplinary classification of adenocarcinoma differentiates between preinvasive, minimally invasive and invasive lesions. Lending new weight to the predominantly histological growth patterns it includes information on molecular genetic alterations such as EGFR mutations.","1386":"Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and related immunosecretory disorders are a group of B-cell proliferations with a wide clinical and prognostic spectrum, characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin by immortalized plasma cells. Recent years have seen an explosion in knowledge on the genetic basis and biology of these diseases, followed by improved clinical risk stratification and the introduction of novel therapeutic concepts, such as treatment with proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory substances. PCM is a common malignancy, accounting for approximately 10% of all hematological neoplasms. There is good evidence to support a multistep transformation process in plasma cell neoplasms, which corresponds to clinically discernible disease stages. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance is a common asymptomatic precursor lesion for PCM which carries an approximately 1% annual risk for progression. Terminal disease stages are characterized by increasing genetic complexity and independence from bone marrow stromal cells and show a rapidly increasing tumour load with severe clinical symptoms. Modern diagnostics of plasma cell neoplasms require inclusion of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypical and cytogenetic features to allow for individual risk assessment and therapy planning.","1387":null,"1388":"Hereditary factors are responsible for 5-10% of all breast cancers and 10% of all ovarian cancer cases and are predominantly caused by mutations in the high risk genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA: breast cancer). Additional moderate and low penetrance gene variants are currently being analyzed via whole genome association studies. Interdisciplinary counseling, quality managed genetic testing and intensified prevention efforts in specialized medical centres are essential for members of high risk families considering the high prevalence of malignant tumors and the early age of onset. Furthermore, the identification of BRCA-deficient carcinomas is of particular clinical interest, especially regarding new specific therapeutic options, e.g. treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. There are presently no valid surrogate markers verifying the association of BRCA1\/BRC2 in tumors. However, breast cancers harboring pathogenic BRCA1 mutations in particular display specific histopathological features.","1389":"Inherited cancer syndromes often involve the central and peripheral nervous system. For the surgical neuropathologist the possibility in individual patients of a familial tumour syndrome needs to be considered in the case of special tumours such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST), medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) or even atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumour (AT\/RT) of the brain. Furthermore, tumour location and patient age may point to a familial tumour syndrome as in the case of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with typical bilateral vestibular schwannoma in young age. This short review discusses some of the diagnostic aspects in this field relating to neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 (NF1, NF2), as well as the two rare tumors MBEN in Gorlin-Goltz syndrome and AT\/RT in particular.","1390":"Hereditary paraganglioma, Gorlin-Goltz syndrome and Fanconi anemia are among the rare hereditary tumor syndromes of the head and neck. Patients with hereditary paraganglioma often develop multiple tumors of the glomus caroticum and glomus jugulotympanicum. The corresponding genetic defects of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase complex induce autonomous tumor cell growth. In patients with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome basal cell carcinomas and keratocystic odontogenic tumors usually occur much earlier than in patients with sporadic tumors. The associated germline mutations are located in the patched gene which is a modulator of the cell cycle. Fanconi anemia represents a chromosomal instability syndrome which is characterized by early onset of pancytopenia, i.e. bone marrow failure and subsequent development of acute myeloid leukemia and\/or squamous cell carcinomas, especially of the head and neck. A total of 13 different gene clusters have been identified in 2 DNA associated complexes which play an important role in DNA repair mechanisms.","1391":null,"1392":"","1393":"","1394":null,"1395":"On a molecular level cancer is characterized not only by genetic defects, such as deletions, mutations or translocations, but also by epigenetic lesions. The most important epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation, Polycomb\/trithorax complexes, histon modifications, non-coding RNAs, and chromosomal territories. These epigenetic mechanisms contribute to a stable modification of gene expression without changes in primary DNA sequence. During the development and progression of human tumours a gene-specific hypermethylation with resulting repression of transcription can occur. At the same time, global hypomethylation can very often be observed which contributes to an increase in chromosomal instability. In tumour pathology, the detection of somatic hMLH1 hypermethylation is important for molecular diagnostics of Lynch syndrome. The detection of MGMT gene methylation is a good prognostic and predictive factor for glioblastoma patients. Performing DNA methylation assays for routine diagnostics requires technical as well as theoretical expertise.","1396":"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hallmark of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), but also occurs in about 12%-15% of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) where it is a consequence of an epigenetic inactivation of MLH1. High frequency MSI (MSI-H; i.e. at least two of five specified microsatellite markers show instability) was shown in a large meta-analysis and in recent trials to be a positive prognostic marker for overall survival in CRC. MSI-H or mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) was also shown to be a marker for ineffectiveness of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy in CRC. At present, there are no guidelines defining the need for microsatellite analysis before chemotherapy. However, studies published to date provide data suggesting that MSI-H CRC patients should not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, with the exception of patients with other factors or poor prognosis (e.g. T4 tumors, G3\/G4 status, blood or lymphatic vessel invasion). MSI or MMRD testing can contribute to a more individualized therapy of CRC and should be performed prior to planned 5-FU monotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy in a non-metastatic setting.","1397":null,"1398":"The application of predictive biomarkers results in an increase in the response rates and overall survival of cancer patients. This had been shown impressively for the detection of mutations in the proto-oncogenes KRAS and EGFR for the application of anti-EGFR targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal carcinomas and non-small-cell lung cancer, respectively. This mutation detection is of a qualitative nature. In addition, predictive biomarkers are known for the use of the commonly administered chemotherapeutics 5-fluorouracil, platinum-containing complexes, and Irinotecan, which are normally identical to the targets of the therapeutic compounds. The determination of these predictive biomarkers also results in an increase in response rates and overall survival. However, this detection is done via the quantitative determination of mRNA expression levels, implying greater efforts in detection, knowledge of cut-off levels, and higher requirements for nationwide establishment.","1399":"The clinical development of specific\/selective or more potent analogues of somatostatin has made the evaluation of somatostatin receptor subtypes in archival specimens or 10% formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) critical to conferring the maximum clinical benefits on NET patients. Immunohistochemistry of somatostatin receptor subtypes could contribute to profiling their expression patterns in these patients. Therefore, surgical pathologists are expected to be asked to immunostain and evaluate somatostatin receptor subtypes in NET specimens in the near future by clinicians. However, there are problems associated with immunohistochemistry of somatostatin receptor subtypes, in particular with their evaluation and interpretation. Therefore, both pathologists and clinicians involved in the care or management of NET patients should be aware of the advantages and limitations of immunohistochemical evaluation of somatostatin receptor subtypes in order to achieve the most efficient treatment outcome for patients.","1400":null,"1401":"Until now high-throughput sequencing of tumor samples relied on DNA isolated from fresh frozen tissues, the preparation of which, however, is relatively laborious. The use of preserved material, i.e. from tissue banks, could help to avoid this limitation and would enable the reanalysis of diverse clinical trials. So far we have shown that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples can be used for genomic re-sequencing processes. FFPE samples are amply available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological diagnosis, and comprise tissue from precursor lesions, primary tumors, and lymphogenic and\/or hematogenic metastases. To generate models which predict the response to therapy, FFPE tissue also has the advantage that it is available from a variety of clinical trials. Second generation sequencing techniques are not only applicable to snap frozen and FFPE tissues for whole genome analyses but also for targeted resequencing approaches. In addition, the detection of copy number variations and mutations in FFPE tissues can be obtained within one sequencing run. The possibility of using genome-wide technologies irrespective of the mode of storage facilitates the retrieval of useful material and is a prerequisite for subsequent computational modelling approaches.","1402":"Only minor modifications were introduced in the classification of squamous cell carcinomas of the oro- and hypopharynx, namely in the definition of some T and N categories. A new TNM classification has been introduced for mucosal melanoma of the head and neck. Some proposals for ramification of the T1 categories of thyroid tumours have been adopted from the TNM Supplement, unfortunately not those proposed for the T3 categories. The new TNM classification of Merkel cell carcinomas, which frequently occur in the head and neck region, is also discussed.","1403":null,"1404":"","1405":"Entirely new classifications are those for gastrointestinal stromal tumours, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and perihilar extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas. Major and praxis-relevant alterations concern colorectal tumours and include new classifications of carcinomas and carcinoids of the appendix. Minor alterations are seen in the classification of hepatocellular carcinomas. No changes were made for tumours of the anal canal, the gallbladder (excluding the inclusion of tumours of the cystic duct) and tumours of the pancreas and the ampulla of Vater.","1406":"Prostate cancer is a common and clinically heterogeneous disease. Understanding the biology of prostate cancer is necessary to best determinate the risk of disease progression and develop novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or slow down disease progression. The recent discovery and subsequent characterization of recurrent gene rearrangements of ETS genes - most frequently ERG - in the majority of prostate cancers is a milestone in translational prostate cancer research. Although multiple molecular alterations have been detected in prostate cancer, a detailed understanding of gene fusion in prostate cancer should help explain the clinical and biologic diversity in addition to providing a rationale for a molecular sub-classification of the disease. This review describes the path from the identification of common ETS gene rearrangements in prostate cancer to possible applications in the treatment of patients, on to the potential scientific implications arising from their discovery.","1407":"Despite considerable advances in recent years in our understanding of the genetic changes occurring in urinary bladder cancer, similar progress in the field of epigenetics has hitherto been lacking. Increasingly, however, focus has shifted in the direction of aberrant DNA methylation as a result of recent studies showing the direct impact of such promoter hypermethylation on the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression and function, therefore potentially affecting tumor genesis and progression. The purpose of this study is the identification and characterization of new DNA methylation markers in urinary bladder cancer, with the expectation that these markers could then be incorporated in a multi-gene panel for clinical use in early cancer detection. In addition, better understanding of the signalling pathways involved will undoubtedly impact the development of new treatment strategies. Potential candidate genes, including the Wnt antagonist SFRP5 among others, will be validated by different epigenetic techniques using invasive and superficial urothelial cell lines as well as tumor and urine samples from bladder cancer patients.","1408":"Platelets are essential corpuscular blood components required for hemostasis. They are released from precursor cells in the bone marrow by cellular fragmentation into the blood stream. Although some aspects of platelet biogenesis are well known, studying its occurrence in vivo has been mostly unsatisfactory. This article reviews some recent findings: It first introduces current models of thrombopoiesis including open questions on cell biology. Second, it presents current findings on the release of megakaryocytes over the endothelial barrier into the blood stream where platelet production takes place outside the bone marrow. Finally, it reports on the translation of the more basic science into an improved understanding of novel parameters from automated blood counters surveying platelet volume (MPV), distribution width (PDW), mass (PCT) and the immature platelet fraction (IPF) into clinics where platelet counts are often the only accessible parameter to evaluate the risk of bleeding. Combining the comprehension of these parameters with a more refined image of how and where platelets are born might help find the cause and best therapy when platelet counts are low.","1409":"The HER2 gene is amplified and overexpressed in about 15%-20% of breast cancers. For every newly diagnosed breast cancer HER2 testing is a standard routine procedure. This article focuses on a number of issues raised in the context of current HER2 testing in breast cancer. It particularly points out issues arising in the recently published ASCO-CAP (American Society of Clinical Oncology\/College of American Pathologists) guideline recommendations for clinical testing of HER2. Despite the significant correlation between HER2 status determination by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), standard considerations of laboratory testing, such as test accuracy, reproducibility and precision as well as current data, favor FISH methods over IHC assay methods for the determination of HER2 status. Biological and technical considerations of HER2 testing are also important in clinical practice. For example, HER2 gene amplification is directly linked to the protein expression level in breast cancer; however, the HER2 protein is not consistently analyzed on formalin fixed tissues due to variability in fixation methods\/times and the impact of this fixation on HER2 protein antigenicity. FISH is significantly less dependent on tissue fixation artifacts. Hence, FISH is more reproducible between both central and peripheral laboratories than IHC and is more accurate for HER2 measurement, as well as being more strongly correlated with responsiveness to trastuzumab and lapatinib treatment. Until other methods are able to ensure similar test accuracy, reproducibility, precision and predictive value, FISH is recommended as the primary HER2 testing modality for women with breast cancer who are candidates for HER2-targeted therapies.","1410":"In the seventh edition of the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours there are several entirely new classifications: upper aerodigestive mucosal melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumour, gastrointestinal carcinoid (neuroendocrine tumour), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, uterine sarcomas, and adrenal cortical carcinoma. Significant modifications concern carcinomas of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, stomach, appendix, biliary tract, lung, skin, prostate and ophthalmic tumours, which will be not addressed in this article. For several tumour entities only minor changes were introduced which might be of importance in daily practice. The new classifications and changes will be commented on without going into details.","1411":null,"1412":"The present review describes the changes in the new 7th edition of the TNM system for tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The description of esophageal tumor localization has been simplified and this new classification now includes tumors of the esophagogastric junction as well as the proximal 5 cm of the stomach. The regional lymph nodes of the esophagus now include celiac lymph nodes, a change which is important for therapeutic decision making. The categories T1 and T4 have been further subclassified. The N categorization now considers not only the presence of metastases but also the number of lymph node metastases within three categories. The T and N categories of stomach tumours (as well as the stage groups) have been modified to ensure a significantly better correlation to the prognosis. The number of lymph nodes has been adapted to 16 to classify pN0. Only slight modifications have been introduced in tumors of the small bowel.","1413":"","1414":"Molecular genetic analysis is gaining in significance for the differential diagnosis of thyroid tumours. Identifying specific mutations and\/or rearrangements offers not only the possibility to distinguish benign from malignant tumours, but also to classify thyroid malignancies more precisely, which can have a substantial influence on the clinical management of patients. In recent years expression analysis of micro-RNA (miRNA) has become an additional tool to improve diagnostic accuracy in thyroid tumours. In addition to its diagnostic contribution, molecular genetic evaluation of thyroid tumours has significantly deepened our understanding of the development, progression and therapy of these tumours.","1415":"Prognosis evaluation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is currently based on tumor diameter, mitotic counts and anatomic localisation. There are two risk classifications as well as the first ever TNM classification for GISTs, whereby the risk classification according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) has the best correlation with clinical follow-up according to own experiences. \"Very low\/low risk\" GISTs are almost benign, while the majority of \"high risk\" GISTs metastasize and benefit from adjuvant therapy. Careful evaluation of mitotic counts in 50 high-power fields is of particular relevance for correct risk classification. Apart from these classical prognostic factors, many molecular genetic parameters with correlation to follow-up have been evaluated and may help to improve prognosis evaluation of GISTs in the future. Since most of the molecular genetic parameters are associated or even determined by the clinico-pathological parameters, an integrated model for tumor progression of GISTs is helpful to interpret the different factors in correlation to one another. In particular for \"intermediate risk\" GISTs, additional parameters are needed for improved prognosis evaluation.","1416":"","1417":"To identify new interactions as well as diagnostically, prognostically and therapeutically relevant differences in the regulation of gene expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), we analyzed the methylation status, mRNA expression, microRNA expression, protein expression and protein phosphorylation in parallel in identical tumor tissue samples. The data were analyzed in a multilayer approach and were correlated to each other and to clinico-pathological parameters. Differentially regulated genes were mapped to signal transduction pathways which are already known to play a major role in GISTs. A functionally orientated overview of the different data layers was constructed, which enabled new insights into gene regulation in GISTs.","1418":"In the 7th edition of the TNM classification most tumor entities have been left unchanged compared to the 6th edition, while some tumor entities and anatomical localizations have been newly introduced, thus following the basic principle of keeping classifications stable over time. In the 7th edition the categories \"MX\" and \"pMX\" have been eliminated because of misunderstandings and misuse. Only the categories \"M0\", \"M1\" and \"pM1\" are still valid and \"pM0\" is not to be used except after performing an autopsy. The classification of perineural invasion (Pn classification) has been newly established and its use is optional. The presence or absence of invasion of perineural spaces does not affect the T category but is considered an additional prognostic factor in some tumor entities.","1419":"The 7th edition of the TNM classification includes only minor changes in the main TNM categories for breast cancer. Only ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ (DCIS, LCIS), and isolated Paget's disease of the nipple are classified as pTis, but not precursor lesions such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia (ADH, ALH). AJCC emphasizes that microscopic measurement is the most accurate and preferred method to determine pT in small invasive cancers and stresses the importance of strict adherence to criteria for T4 cancers. For better distinction from micrometastases in regional lymph nodes, small clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm, or nonconfluent or nearly confluent clusters of cells not exceeding 200 cells in a single histologic lymph node cross section are classified as isolated tumour cells (pN0(i+)). The pN classification has otherwise remained unchanged. In the setting of patients having received neoadjuvant therapy, ypT1-ypT3 is based on the total extent of viable tumour cells, irrespective of tumour regression. Stage I breast tumours have been subdivided into Stage IA and Stage IB; Stage IB includes small tumours (TI) with lymph node micrometastases (N1mi). These changes and clarifications will contribute to maintaining the clinical and prognostic relevance of TNM in breast cancer.","1420":"Tissue samples have been routinely used for decades to distinguish healthy from diseased tissue in histopathological characterization. While nucleic acid-based methodologies have been successfully in use for many years, protein-based techniques, in contrast, are at a very early stage (with the exception of immunohistochemistry). One reason for this delay may be that the scientific community has long thought that formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues are unfit for protein analysis. However, recent reports demonstrate that many protein methods that are routinely used for frozen tissues can also be applied for FFPE tissues, including Western blot, protein microarray, matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization (MALDI) imaging and 2D gel electrophoresis. The present article provides an overview of recent developments in this field, focussing particular attention on quantitative analysis and high throughput technologies that have the potential to be integrated into the routine workflow of clinical pathology laboratories.","1421":"Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent an attractive option for cell replacement strategies (tissue engineering, TE). TE applications require stability of a stem cell\/biomaterial-hybrid via cell migration, matrix-remodelling and differentiation. We focus on these mechanisms in organotypic culture systems for bone TE using MSC from the umbilical cord (UC-MSC) and from bone marrow (BM-MSC). For the organotypic differentiation of MSC into functional osteoblasts, MSC were embedded in a collagenous matrix and subjected to osteogenic differentiation. Under these culture conditions, UC-MSC exceeded BM-MSC in the expression and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, while BM-MSC show enhanced osteogenic gene upregulation. In both cell types the biosynthetic activity was accompanied by the ultrastructural appearance of hydroxyapatite\/calcium crystals. Following secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, both MSC types migrated into and colonised the collagenous matrix causing matrix strengthening and contraction. In conclusion, MSC promise a broad therapeutical application for a variety of connective tissues requiring ECM synthesis and remodelling.","1422":"Activating FGFR3 mutations have been identified in a variety of benign skin lesions (seborrheic keratosis, epidermal nevus, solar lentigo). However, the functional consequences of these mutations in the human epidermis are unknown. We therefore analyzed functional effects of the common R248C mutation in HaCaT keratinocytes. The cells were stably transduced with the R248C FGFR3 mutation or FGFR3-IIIb wildtype sequence using a retroviral system. The R248C mutant keratinocytes revealed significantly enhanced cell growth compared with wildtype cells after reaching confluence. Likewise, apoptosis and attachment to fibronectin were significantly reduced in mutant cells. In contrast, there was no difference regarding migration and oncogene-induced senescence. Gene expression analysis revealed only a few differentially expressed genes between mutant and wildtype HaCaT keratinocytes. ERK1\/2 appear to be involved in the FGFR3-dependent signalling of R248C mutant keratinocytes. Our results indicate that an increased cell number at confluence along with reduced apoptosis may contribute to the growth of benign acanthotic tumors in the human epidermis.","1423":"Only about 2% of the human genome constitute protein-coding genes - nevertheless, medical research has focused mainly on this portion in recent decades. Since up to 70% of the human genome is transcribed into RNA, the genome contains much more non-coding information than coding, which is present in the cell as non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Many of these ncRNAs are highly expressed, specifically regulated and evolutionarily conserved, arguing in favor of their functional significance. MicroRNAs are the most well-known ncRNAs, but many other long ncRNAs exist. Differential ncRNA or microRNA expression patterns correlate with diagnosis or prognosis in many tumor entities and can thus serve as an extensive source of new biomarkers. The expression of the long ncRNA MALAT1 correlates with tumor development, progression or survival in lung, liver and breast cancer. Functionally active ncRNAs can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying tumor development. The large number of different, often as yet unidentified ncRNAs promises new stimuli for the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of many diseases.","1424":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant tumors worldwide with poor prognosis. Based on high-throughput screening technology, we and others have identified factors and pathways that are pivotal for tumor progression including transcription factors and microtubule-interacting proteins. In addition, aberrant activation of the IGF signalling pathway is frequently observed in HCCs which is predominantly based on high level expression of its ligand IGF-II. Because protumorigenic effects of IGF-II such as proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and migration are transmitted through its receptor IGF-1R, selective inhibition of this tyrosine kinase by small molecule compounds might reduce IGF-II-driven tumor growth. Indeed, administration of IGF-1R-selective inhibitors reduces IGF-II-induced effects and was associated with a significant reduction of tumor growth in a xenograft transplantation model. In conclusion, the IGF-II\/IGF-1R signalling pathway is critically involved in the regulation of tumor growth and tumor cell dissemination, representing a promising therapeutic target structure in the treatment of HCC.","1425":"To establish precise diagnostic algorithms and standardised treatment of sarcomas in specialized centers, the interdisciplinary research group KoSar (sarcoma competence network) has been funded by German Cancer Aid. A sarcoma tissue repository and a diagnostic reference center have been set up, presently containing about 1000 accurately diagnosed sarcomas of different entities. Significant gene expression profiles for synovial sarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, myxoid liposarcomas and a small profile for myxofibrosarcomas as well as a new classification of angiosarcomas were defined. We systematically searched for activated signal transduction pathways in sarcoma cell lines and xenograft transplant models and candidate targets for molecular therapies were identified. Based on these results first clinical studies have been initiated by the German Interdisciplinary Sarcoma Study Group (GISG).","1426":"In this study, we investigated whether recurrences of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) are true relapses arising from the primary tumour or clonally unrelated secondary neoplasias. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of eleven patients with recurrent HL were analyzed. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells were microdissected after immunohistochemical staining for CD30 using laser-capture technique. Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene fragment lengths were analyzed applying consensus FR3 and J primers. Two early relapses after the first HL diagnosis were clonally related to the initial tumour, while three of four early recurrences after a first or second relapse were not. Three patients presenting with late relapses had clonally unrelated neoplasms. Therefore, we conclude that recurrent HL may represent a novel neoplasm, a finding which might play a role in clinical decision-making.","1427":null,"1428":"","1429":"The incidence of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas shows a slight upward trend, while the prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer remains poor. Little progress has been made in early diagnosis due to accompanying chronic pancreatitis and the histopathologically well known \"desmoplastic stroma reaction\". The cancer originates in the ductal epithelium, while the cell of origin is the \"centroacinar\" cell. Up to 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer have a family history of the disease. In about 10%, a hereditary tumor syndrome could be identified. At initial diagnosis, only 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with localized, potentially curable tumors. To ensure accurate staging of resected pancreatic cancer, care has to be taken in applying the correct R (residual tumor) classification, whereby the circumferential resection margins require particular attention. Tumor size as well as the number of resected (and examined) lymph nodes is of prognostic significance. Standardized protocols for uniform histopathological work-up are strongly recommended.","1430":"Results of molecular pathology have supported changes in the 2004 WHO classification of urothelial cancer. Since then new molecular data such as the distribution pattern of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has further supported the principle of low and high grade entities of urothelial carcinoma. Animal experiments with knockout mice and conditional knockout systems reveal important parallels to humans and results emphasize the cellular context as a trigger for malignancy. One special feature of the urothelium is its high protection of the urothelial cells by members of the retinoblastoma gene family, efficiently inhibiting invasion even in the presence of p53 mutations. In search of the tumor stem cell phenotype the basal cell phenotype is the focus of attention providing a high clonogenic potential. At the same time detailed analysis of the distribution of mutations in the mitochondrial genome within the urothelium will help to gain insight into the spreading of normal cell or tumor cell clones. The overall data in urological oncology provide evidence that diagnostic and prognostic tools for urothelial cancer can only be reached with multiparametric approaches.","1431":"The accumulation of hepatocellular lipid droplets, referred to as steatosis, is the most frequent liver pathology in western industrial countries. The surface of lipid droplets is stabilized by amphiphilic proteins of the PAT family (perilipin, adipophilin, TIP47). We recently showed that PAT proteins are differentially expressed in liver. The effects of lipid droplet induction with oleate and of siRNA-mediated downregulation of PAT proteins were evaluated using immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblot and functional assays. Whereas perilipin, adipophilin and (in only minor amounts) also TIP47 coat lipid droplets in steatotic hepatocytes, adipophilin and TIP47, but not perilipin, are detectable in hepatocellular cell cultures. Likewise, perilipin is not induced after downregulation of adipophilin and TIP47. Common cell culture models show specific differences to human hepatocyte steatosis in vivo. Perilipin may play a role in the long-term storage of fat, which may be only partially reflected by cell culture models. ","1432":"In 50% of all cases, bladder cancer patients develop tumor progression despite modern surgical methods such as radical cystectomy. A solution to the problem might be the identification and understanding of molecular biomarkers which could result in the development of advanced methods with better preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic potential. One suitable approach is the identification of a bladder cancer-specific molecular marker in order to enhance patients' outcome. We and others have identified EMMPRIN as a prognostic biomarker in a variety of tumor diseases. EMMPRIN (CD147, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) is a cell surface protein that is expressed among other cell types, in particular in tumor cells. Since its first description in 1982 it is established that overexpression of EMMPRIN correlates with tumor progression and patient outcome. EMMPRIN expression levels can be used as an independent prognostic factor for survival. Recently, EMMPRIN has been defined as a potential target for tumor therapy in preclinical studies.","1433":null,"1434":"The aim of our study was to develop and optimize methods for relative and absolute protein quantifications in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues with special emphasis on HER mediated pathways in breast cancer. Using a recently developed technology for extraction of full-length proteins from FFPE tissues, we evaluated &gt;50 commercial antibodies for specificity using Western blots and protein microarrays. Purified HER receptor proteins were used to determine absolute protein concentrations. We confirmed specificity of 23 commercially available phosphospecific and non-phosphospecific antibodies using Western blots with protein extracts from cell lines and tissue extracts from breast cancer patients. Spiking known amounts of purified HER receptor proteins in HER receptor negative tissue extracts allowed us to precisely measure abundances of HER-receptors. Our results will provide a basis for the development of diagnostic techniques for the quantitative analysis of deregulated HER receptors and downstream signalling proteins in typical clinical tissues. ","1435":"This thesis work summarizes two scientific fields of interest of the author: The first group of studies represents experimental approaches in the field of immunopathology, analyzing translational questions of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The focus here was on cell migration studies of donor T cells in the setting of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and on ex vivo expanded host dendritic cells. Using a combination of antibody homing blockade and splenectomy development of acute GVHD was successfully prevented in a murine major mismatch model. The second group of studies focussed on molecular diagnostic strategies for the detection of infectious diseases. Analysis of a collection of granulomatous reactions was performed amplifying the 65-kDa heat-shock protein gene. This enabled detection of mycobacterial DNA in 63% of cases, containing a high fraction of nontuberculous mycobacterial DNA (34%). Sequencing strategies have proven a very helpful tool, especially for subtyping NTM species on paraffin embedded material.","1436":"","1437":"Intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 protein expression and HER2 gene amplification can negatively affect determination of HER2 status in a subset of invasive breast carcinomas. The frequency and clinical significance of HER2 genetic heterogeneity are unknown due to the lack of uniform criteria for diagnosis. Recent ASCO\/CAP guidelines (2009) define HER2 genetic heterogeneity as the presence of between 5% and 50% of tumor cells with a HER2\/CEP17 ratio &gt;2.2. We describe a tool (a customized Excel spreadsheet) for easy and reproducible diagnosis of HER2 genetic heterogeneity according to ASCO\/CAP criteria. Our tool may be useful for routine HER2 diagnostics and for studies to analyse the hitherto unknown predictive significance of HER2 genetic heterogeneity.","1438":"Renal neoplasms with dominant cysts represent a broad spectrum of known as well as novel renal tumor entities. Established renal tumors with dominant cysts include cystic nephroma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumor, synovial sarcoma and multilocular cystic renal cancer (WHO classification 2004). Novel tumor types have recently been reported, which are also characterized by marked cyst formation. Examples are tubulocystic renal cancer and renal cancer in end-stage renal disease. These tumors are very likely to be included in a future WHO classification due to their characteristic phenotype and molecular features. Cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma frequently coexist in the kidneys of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Cysts are also a component of many sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma is composed almost exclusively of cysts and is regarded as a specific subtype of clear cell renal cancer. Recent molecular findings suggest that clear cell renal cancer may develop via a cyst-dependent mechanism in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome as well as via cyst-independent molecular pathways in sporadic clear cell renal cancer.","1439":"Paragangliomas have a classical histomorphology comprising a so-called \"Zellballen\" or nesting pattern with surrounding S100 protein positive sustentacular cells (SC) which form a meshwork with a wire-fence appearance. In adrenal and extra-adrenal paragangliomas the prevalence of SC is inversely associated with the patients' outcome. In order to get more insight into the prevalence as well as the prognostic and differential diagnostic value of this cell population in pulmonary carcinoids, we investigated a panel of 26 tumorlets, 147 typical and atypical pulmonary carcinoids and ten thoracic paragangliomas immunohistochemically. We were able to demonstrate that S100 protein positive cells are similarly distributed in both thoracic paragangliomas and pulmonary carcinoids. Hence, the presence and distribution of these cells does not appear to represent a reliable criterion in differential diagnosis. Moreover, all pulmonary carcinoid patients with a worse outcome had low numbers of or no S100 protein positive cells in their tissue specimens. Thus, the prevalence of these cells may potentially aid in prognostic assessment of pulmonary carcinoids, especially in biopsies.","1440":"","1441":"The case of a 59-year-old patient is described who presented with a left-sided pressure sensation in the left orbit and exophthalmus with a proud bulbus. The limited bulbus motility led to double vision. A preoperative MRI showed a space-occupying lesion in the left medial orbit. The morphological and immunohistochemical findings led to the diagnosis of a primary ductal carcinoma resembling salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). The tumor could be removed without compromising the eye. The patient suffers no side-effects or recurrences 12 months later.","1442":null,"1443":"In order to cope with increasing demands to supply information to a variety of documentation systems outside pathology, pathologists need to set standards both for the content and the use of the information they generate. Oncological datasets based on a set vocabulary are urgently required for use both in pathology and in further processing. Data elements were defined according to German pathology report guidelines for colorectal cancers in line with ISO 11179 requirements for the relations between data element concepts and value domains, as well as for further formal conditions, which can be exported in XML together with metadata information. Tests on 100 conventionally written diagnoses showed their principal usability and an increasing degree of guideline conformity in diagnoses commensurate with training time. This set of oncological data elements is a valuable checklist tool for pathologists, enabling formatted information export for further use and saving documentation effort.","1444":"Autopsy rates have been declining for decades all over the world; however, the causes of this decline have not been clearly elucidated. This negative trend could cause wider problems as yet unthought of. Autopsies serve medical training and specialist medical training, quality management, patient care systems as well as cause of death statistics, thereby ensuring good medical practice and a balanced allocation of funds. The aim of this article is to present autopsies and their impact on teaching, patient care and epidemiology in an objective manner. Heeding the crucial points could have a positive effect on the entire health system with a minimum of effort, while ignoring them could have adverse consequences for physicians, patients and their relatives, as well as society as a whole.","1445":"Here we report the case of a newborn with glycogenosis type IV (Andersen disease), who died shortly after birth. The diagnosis was established in the first instance by light microscopy and histochemistry, and subsequently ultrastructurally. DNA could be extracted from a fibroblast cell culture by sequencing the causative GBE1 gene (glycogen branching enzyme 1). Two compound heterozygous mutations in the gene were identified. The differential diagnosis should include Lafora disease as well as polyglucosan body disease. Since there is no effective therapy for glycogenosis type IV to date, prenatal diagnosis is mandatory.","1446":"","1447":"Based on data from a large multicenter phase III trial (ToGA study) trastuzumab has very recently been approved by the EMEA for metastatic gastric cancer and adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction. Only patients with tumors which over express Her2 as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory FISH+ result, or IHC 3+, determined by an accurate and validated assay are eligible for trastuzumab therapy. However, testing of Her2 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) differs from breast cancer in core aspects: 1. IHC2+\/3+ is scored even though membranous staining is incomplete if membrane staining is clearly detectable even at low magnification (2.5x\/5x, 3+) or medium magnification (10x\/20x, 2+). 2. Additionally, membrane staining at the appropriate intensity found in at least 10% of tumor cells is restricted to resection specimens. Evaluation of Her2 in situ hybridization (ISH) is similar to breast cancer with ratio values of &gt; or =2.0 indicating Her2 gene amplification. Taking these modifications into account and defining the HER2 positive subgroup as IHC 3+ and IHC2+\/FISH+, approximately 16% of gastric cancers are considered Her2 positive, affecting mainly tumor regions with intestinal (gland forming) type carcinoma. In contrast to breast cancer, up to one-third of gastric cancers show a heterogeneous Her2 status both at IHC and ISH levels which favors bright field ISH over FISH.","1448":"Forensic medicine incorporates research, teaching and professional service. In the routine practice this encompasses interdisciplinary cooperation with physicians, natural scientists and the legal profession. Lectures in forensic medicine include the correct performance of an external examination of corpses, which every physician must be capable of, just as medical questions and the evidential documentation of injuries. Clinical forensic medicine encompasses the examination and documentation of living victims of physical and\/or sexual violence. For further training to become a specialist for forensic medicine it is mandatory to undertake a 6-month training period in pathology. Fatalities with an unclear or unnatural manner of death must be registered with the police. On suspicion of third party involvement the public prosecutor will request a legal autopsy, which is carried out and documented by two physicians in accordance with the penal code. Imaging procedures are standard for an autopsy. Extensive samples are taken for additional testing, such as toxicological and molecular biological investigations.","1449":"","1450":"The term gastric adenoma usually refers to a flat adenoma of the intestinal type. Adenomas of the gastric type, so-called pyloric gland adenomas (PGA), which was first characterized by German and Japanese pathologists in 1990, have been regarded as exceptional until recently. In 2003, we first reported systematic clinical pathological analyses of PGA, demonstrating its unstable and precancerous nature. American gastrointestinal pathologists have finally recognized this disease entity in 2009. In this article we introduce the Japanese criteria of the gastric adenoma and review and discuss the clinical pathological and molecular aspects of PGAs.","1451":"Helicobacter pylori infection plays a central role in the development of gastric MALT-type (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma. Infection results in chronic H. pylori gastritis and stimulates together with antigens or autoantigens proliferation of B-lymphocytes which is the basis for the neoplastic transformation. Histology of MALT-type lymphoma is architecturally similar to the physiological MALT. Invasion and destruction of the gastric epithelium with development of so-called lympho-epithelial lesions is the most important diagnostic criterion. Cytologically MALT-lymphoma resembles centrocytes and monocytes. For definitive lymphoma diagnosis and for the differential diagnosis from other small cell lymphomas in the stomach immunohistochemistry can be helpful. The phenotype of MALT-type lymphoma is identical to non-neoplastic B-lymphocytes of the marginal zone (CD20+, CD5-, CD10- and CD23-). Individual therapy is strongly dependent from histological type and lymphoma stadium. Therapy modalities are H. pylori eradication, radiochemotherapy, surgery or a combination of these. Aim of the therapy is the complete lymphoma regression and cure of the disease.","1452":"Littoral cell angioma is a rare vascular tumor of the spleen. An increased association with concomitant malignancies has been described. We report the case of a 67-year-old man suffering from colon carcinoma and presenting with a tumor of the spleen which could be seen using radiography. Splenectomy was performed and histology revealed a 2.1 cm vascular tumor with a characteristic immunophenotype (CD31\/68+). In addition a hepatocellular carcinoma was found. Due to the relationship with malignant tumors littoral cell angioma should be considered in every case of a splenic tumoral space-occupying mass, particularly in carcinoma patients.","1453":"Pseudoneoplastic regeneration has become an important differential diagnosis to gastric carcinoma. Increasing use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appears to be related to this entity. In recent years knowledge of pseudoneoplastic regeneration has continuously improved and the proportion of this designation among cases sent to our institute for second opinion decreased from more than 50% in 2000 to approximately 10% today. In diagnostically difficult cases the gastritis status may help: the majority of patients with gastric carcinoma show either active or treated Helicobacter gastritis, whereas individuals with pseudocarcinomatous regeneration often show chemical reactive gastritis (reactive gastropathy). Gastric ulcers should always be followed-up during the healing phase. A second opinion may confirm the differential diagnosis.","1454":"The diagnosis and therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the stomach are based on their exact classification and risk stratification. Since the incidence of gastric NETs has risen sharply over the last 35 years and most tumors are detected endoscopically at an early stage, they have come to represent a challenge for the pathologist. Gastric NETs are classified according to the WHO and TNM classifications and additionally separated into four biologically distinct types: Well differentiated type 1 and 2 gastric NETs (G1) smaller than 2 cm, and type 3 smaller than 1 cm that do not infiltrate the muscularis propria or show angioinvasion have a good prognosis and can be removed endoscopically. Well differentiated type 1 and 2 gastric NETs (G1-G2) larger than 2 cm or type 3 with a diameter above 1 cm or with infiltration of the muscular wall and\/or angioinvasion and poorly differentiated (type 4) neuroendocrine carcinomas carry a poor prognosis and need to be treated aggressively. Endosonography is the method of choice for determining the size, depth of infiltration and presence of lymph node metastases. With exact diagnosis and adequate treatment, the majority of patients with gastric NETs have a favorable prognosis.","1455":"Gastric leishmaniasis was diagnosed in a 43-year-old HIV infected patient by histopathology as an accidental diagnostic finding. Leishmania HIV co-infections have increasingly been reported recently as a result of intensive travelling and an increase in geographical extension. Nevertheless, Leishmania gastritis is a rare disease which can occur without clinical symptoms and in the absence of endoscopic abnormalities. In this case microscopic detection of the pathogen in macrophages of the gastric mucosa resulted in the correct diagnosis.","1456":"Two cases of primary gastric atypical lipomatous tumors (ALT) are presented. In case No.1, a 7x4x3 cm submucosal ALT (lipoma-like subtype) of the antrum\/pyloric region in a 60-year-old woman was completely resected. Using interphase dual-color-FISH, MDM2- and CDK4 amplifications could be detected in distinguished amplicons. The patient was continuously free of disease after 56 months. In case No. 2, a 3.5 cm (in diameter) submucosal ALT (lipoma-like subtype) of the gastric body in a 56-year-old woman was completely resected. FISH revealed MDM2 amplification while the CDK4 gene remained in diploid copies. This patient was continuously free of disease after 36 months. The morphologic and molecular biological findings of this rare primary gastric mesenchymal tumor are discussed in comparison with the corresponding soft tissue lesions.","1457":"Both alcoholic (AFL) and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) are characterized by lipid deposition in hepatocytes. The diagnosis of steatosis is made when lipid deposition exceeds 5% of hepatocytes, while involvement of more than 50% is called \"fatty liver \". An additional inflammatory reaction leads to alcoholic (ASH) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Steatohepatitis is present when both inflammatory infiltrates of mixed cells in the small liver lobules as well as liver cell injury in terms of ballooning can be detected.Liver biopsy represents the \"gold standard\" for confirming diagnosis and determining inflammatory activity and potential fibrosis of fatty liver disease.The differential diagnosis of ASH-NASH cannot be made on the basis of histological criteria alone. Steatosis, inflammatory changes and hepatocytic injury can be semiquantified as a \"Brunt Score\" or \"NAS\" (NAFLD activity score), providing the basis on which to decide whether or not steatohepatitis is present.People at increased risk of developing a fatty liver possess an increased risk of developing chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH).Histologically, pediatric NASH differs from adult NASH and is often only clinically manifest through a mild if persistent elevation in transaminases.","1458":"","1459":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most frequent mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Two thirds of them are located in the stomach, another 30% occur in the small bowel, while the remaining tumors occur in the rectum or more rarely in the oesophagus. GIST most commonly grow from the smooth muscular layer towards the serosal surface whereas development towards to the mucosal layer is less frequent. In the latter case ulceration may occur, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding as the main symptom. However, the majority of GIST of the stomach are asymptomatic, resulting in large tumors on initial diagnosis. Most gastric GIST are not visible on endoscopy but may be diagnosed by endosonography. Due to their location in the outer layers of the tubular gastrointestinal tract biopsy is often hindered of even impossible. GIST of the stomach differ from tumors in other locations with regard to their morphology, molecular pathology and prognosis. This present article provides an overview of these differences also with regard to possible therapeutic consequences.","1460":"Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFP) were described by Vanek 60 years ago as \"submucosal granuloma with eosinophilic infiltration\". IFP represent polypous proliferations of spindle cells in the submucosa and mucosa of the stomach, small bowel and colon with inflammatory infiltration. The lesions have been regarded as inflammatory and reactive. Recent data show that the spindle cells express PDGFRA, and the majority of IFP harbour activating PDGFRA mutations. Therefore, IFP represent true benign mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.","1461":"Renal carcinomas have been classified with increasing accuracy in recent years and new sub-groups have been assigned, which, due to their distinct development pathways, carry varying prognoses and require specific treatment approaches. A range of antibodies are available for their immunohistochemical classification. Identifying a gene defect--mutation, deletion, trisomies and monosomies, oncogene activation--enables the application of targeted therapy, e.g. using antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in signaling pathways, among others. Renal carcinoma diagnosis by the pathologist is taking on a particularly important role.","1462":null,"1463":"","1464":"Lipofibromatosis is a typical soft tissue lesion of childhood which is most likely underdiagnosed. The case of a 6-year-old girl with a palmar tumor is presented. The lesion showed a typical fascicular growth patter into the fatty tissue. Differential diagnosis includes fibrous hamartoma of infancy. Lipofibromatosis is a benign disease but recurrences are not unusual.","1465":"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and related chronic disorders constitute a subgroup of myeloid malignancies which are defined according to clinical, morphological and molecular features by the actual World Health Organization classification of tumors of the haematopietic system. Screening procedures for a BCR-ABL fusion gene, JAK2, thrombopoietin receptor and KIT mutations are formally included in the diagnostic approach. Myelodysplastic\/MPN overlap syndromes include rare entities such as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts characterized by a high proportion of JAK2V617F mutated cases. The paradigm of targeted treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia with imatinib has now been extended to eosinophilia-associated myeloid neoplasms with PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 gene mutations. Pegylated interferon-alpha has convincingly been proved to reduce the JAK2 allele burden. JAK2 inhibitor drugs are currently being tested in clinical trials. The development of pathogenesis-targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the various MPNs will continue in the future.","1466":"Modern histochemical, immunological, genetic and molecular biological techniques now make precise tumour diagnosis and identification of biological subgroups possible. By detecting molecular and genetic aberrations, subgroups with varying clinical courses can be distinguished and treated in a targeted manner with the use of antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This development will lead to even more accurate diagnosis and affect therapeutic decisions.","1467":"A 7-cm cystic lesion in the upper left abdomen and additional smaller solid tumor nodules were diagnosed incidentally in a 15-year-old boy without tumor symptoms. The main tumorous cystic lesion showed a flattened single-cell tumor cell component in gradual transition to stratified, papillary and truly \"invasive\" typical desmoplastic areas of a desmoplastic small round-cell tumor (DSRCT). The Ki-67-proliferation index gradually increased within three histologic tumor patterns up to about 70% in the typical desmoplastic (infiltrating) component. Using microdissection techniques, EWS-WT1-gene fusion transcripts were detected in the cystic (single-cell-layered), the papillary and the solid tumor proliferations (exon 7 of EWS on chromosome 22 with exon 8 of WT1 on chromosome 11). The presented case illustrates a predominant cystic growth pattern of DSRCT, in which a stepwise development in the pathogenesis of DSRCT from cystic (-\"mesothelioblastic\") towards a more papillary proliferation and finally typical \"infiltrative\" desmoplastic tumor pattern might be discussed. The cystic pattern could represent an initial stage in the development of the neoplasia. The presence of specific EWS-WT1-gene fusion transcripts in all tumor growth patterns in this respect would indicate an early event in t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation in the pathogenesis of DSRCT.","1468":"The case of a lipomatous tumor with a predominant lipoma component and transition to an atypical lipomatous tumor is presented. A deep-seated soft tissue tumor of the right thigh with a maximum size of 14 cm was resected in a 70-year-old female patient. Corresponding to a comparable macroscopic aspect, the lesion revealed the histological features of an ordinary lipoma without atypia in about 80% of the specimen. In the remaining portion (approximately 20%) histopathology showed an atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT, lipoma-like subtype). Immunohistochemistry for MDM 2 and CDK4 revealed no immunoreactivity in the lipoma component, but within the ALT component. Interphase dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization showed no amplification of the MDM 2 gene and rarely CDK4 gene amplification within the lipoma component, but high level amplification of MDM 2\/CDK4 gene in the ALT area, further supporting the morphologically based diagnosis of a lipomatous tumor including areas of a true lipoma and ALT. This case underlines the concept of a continuous stepwise development of lipomatous soft tissue tumors from benign to malignant counterparts as a biological continuum.","1469":"Gardner fibroma represents a rare and recently described soft tissue tumor entity in children and young adults. It consists of haphazardly arranged coarse and hyalinized collagen fibers combined with loosely arranged bland spindle and fibroblastic cells. The case of a 13-year-old male patient with Gardner fibroma and osteoma and multicentric desmoid type fibromatosis in his mother is presented with detection of a (heterozygotic) germline mutation of the APC gene leading to a de novo stop codon (deletion of base pairs 5033-5036). FISH analysis revealed a structural loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the APC gene on chromosomal locus 5q21 in one out of five analysed desmoids of the mother, no LOH of APC gene in the Gardner fibroma. Gardner fibroma in children and young adults may serve as an indicator lesion for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner syndrome, a familial desmoid type fibromatosis without other manifestations of APC or a new APC gene mutation. For the clinician, this diagnosis should be commented upon accordingly by the surgical pathologist. As the result of a detected APC gene mutation, continuous follow-up for the development of colorectal tumors and desmoid type fibromatosis as well as a familial screening for FAP is recommended.","1470":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a soft tissue lesion which can be found in almost all parts of the human body, but shows the highest incidence in the abdomen. It is a spindle cell lesion with prominent inflammatory infiltrate which consists predominantly of plasma cells. Using immunohistochemistry a myofibroblastic differentiation can be demonstrated. ALK is expressed in approximately 50% of tumors. The tumors are associated with a benign behavior but recurrences occur in about one third of abdominal cases. Malignant cases are rare.","1471":"","1472":"Based on the IASLC multicenter data collected worldwide on 81495 patients diagnosed or registered with lung cancer between 1990 and 2000, the T, N, and M descriptors were analyzed and recommendations for changes in the seventh edition of the TNM classification were proposed on the basis of differences in survival. This new TNM classification replaces the old UICC classification and the staging system according to C. Mountain 1997. The changes principally affect the T and M classifications. For the T component, tumor size was found to have prognostic relevance and its analysis led to recommendations to subclassify T1 into T1a and T1b, and T2 tumors into T2a and T2b and to reclassify T2 tumor&gt;7 cm into T3 tumors. In the M category, M1 was recommended to be subclassified into M1a (contralateral lung nodules and pleural dissemination) and M1b (distant metastasis). There is no change in the N category. The proposed changes for the new stage grouping are to upstage T2b N0 M0 from stage IB to stage IIA and to downstage T2a N1 M0 from stage IIB to stage IIA and T4 N0-N1 M0 from stage IIIB to stage IIIA. The particulars of the new classification are discussed in the context of practice-relevant aspects from a pathology perspective view.","1473":"Principally there are two different types of bladder cancer. Non-invasive papillary low grade tumors (pTa G1-G2) are genetically stable, recur frequently but show a low risk of progression. On the other hand there are high grade tumors (pT1-4, carcinoma in situ), which are genetically unstable, show biologically aggressive behaviour and progress. The distinction between non-invasive (pTa) and minimal-invasive (pT1) is one of the most challenging areas in bladder pathology. Due to the lack of appropriate auxiliary analysis the diagnosis is based entirely on histopathology. P53 immunohistochemistry can be helpful in the assessment of recurring high grade neoplasia. Targeted therapy in bladder cancer is particularly interesting, since a high number of oncogenes are activated and overexpressed (e.g. HER2 and EGFR).","1474":"","1475":"In the last ten years, almost 60 departments of surgical pathology were accredited in Germany according to DIN EN ISO\/IEC 17020. Accreditation in pathology was accompanied by the adoption of a highly dynamic process, which requires staff to be more aware of quality and to introduce a quality-oriented system. The accreditation body in turn needed to consider all the duties, responsibilities and processes in surgical pathology and was supported in this regard by the Sector Committee of Pathology and Neuropathology of the DGA German Association for Accreditation. In this review we illustrate the various problems associated with accreditation in surgical pathology by answering eight questions that have arisen over many years of activity. These include the registration and appropriate presentation of the scope of accreditation, the terminology, as well as the extent and depth of documentation. A department of pathology applying for accreditation is required to document the entire step-wise process leading to a surgical pathological diagnosis.","1476":"Soft-tissue tumors with haemangiopericytoma (HPC)-like growth patterns can now be divided into three categories: (1) The solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) group with its variants; (2) lesions showing clear evidence of myoid\/pericytic differentiation and corresponding to \"true\" HPCs (myopericytoma\/glomangiopericytoma and a subset of sinonasal HPCs); (3) neoplasms that occasionally display HPC-like features (e.g. synovial sarcoma). In this study 268 intrathoracic and extrathoracic SFTs from the German consultation and reference center of soft tissue tumors in Jena were evaluated and analyzed immunohistochemically with antibodies CD34, Bcl-2, CD99, SMA, S100, PanCK and Ki-67. Furthermore, SFTs were categorized into the newly proposed SFT designation: Fibrous variant, cellular variant (more than 90% hypercellularity), fat-forming variant, giant cell-rich variant and malignant SFTs. This article should provide insights into the diagnosis of this entity with emphasis on the new international standard.","1477":"Malignant lymphomas are classified into different entities according to their morphology, immunohistochemical parameters and clinical behavior. Several important pathogenetic events can be assigned to certain lymphoma entity types. Nevertheless, some cases present overlapping morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics and a clear-cut diagnosis cannot be made. This is particularly the case with aggressive lymphomas for which a clear distinction cannot be made between the entities of diffuse large cell lymphoma\/Burkitt lymphoma or primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma\/classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. In order to redress this situation, two new gray zone entities were introduced in the WHO 2008 classification. Until further knowledge regarding the therapy, behavior and prognosis of these gray zone lymphomas has been gained, they should continue to be considered as distinct entities.","1478":"Lymph node staging is the most important prognostic parameter in malignant gastrointestinal tumors. Manual dissection of adipose tissue is time-consuming and also depends on the experience of the individual examiner. By combining elution with acetone and mechanical compression using simple equipment it was possible to completely embed adipose tissue from 404 surgical specimens (colon 348, stomach 28, greater omentum 14, other location 14) without manual dissection. As a result of the procedure, the weight of the adipose tissue could be reduced by 90%-95%, making full histological examination possible. The colon specimens included an average of 43.8 lymph nodes (14-109) in 14 embedding cassettes (1-38) with a native fat weight of 234.7 g (42.8-820 g). The quality of histological staining, including immunohistochemical and molecular investigations, is of comparable quality to routine work-up. Elution with acetone enables the prompt, standardized and full histological work-up of adipose tissue without manual dissection. Moreover, additional costs are low. The number of lymph nodes required by medical associations was attained in all cases and often exceeded. This method was successfully used in other organs (greater omentum, breast).","1479":"Lung cancer is the most common tumor-related cause of death in western industrialized countries, despite continuous improvement in both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Since epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in 80% of cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma, mediating important carcinogenic properties such as cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis, it is considered a relevant target in novel specific therapies. This has lead to the development of the low-molecular EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) Gefitinib and Erlotinib. Predicting which patients will respond to an EGFR-targeted therapy is of particular clinical interest. Recent studies show a significantly better response and prolonged progression-free survival in patients with EGFR-mutated tumors, even when used as first-line therapy. Moreover, genetic mutations which correlate to primary EGFR-TKI resistance (e.g. KRAS) or produce secondary resistance to known TKI (e.g. EGFR mutation T790 M or MET amplification) have meanwhile been explained. Predictive diagnosis of these mutations using histological material is becoming increasingly important for patient stratification and will soon be indispensable not only for lung cancer.","1480":"Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are rare soft tissue sarcomas showing a skeletal muscle differentiation. Histologically, embryonal, alveolar and pleomorphic subtypes are distinguished. RMS represent one of the most frequent sarcomas in children and adolescents, and in this age group embryonal and alveolar subtypes predominate. RMS in adults is extremely rare, and the pleomorphic subtype is most frequently seen. Spindle cell and sclerosing RMS in adults are very rare and, unlike the morphologically comparable tumors in children and adolescents, clinically aggressive neoplasms, which need to be distinguished from spindle cell malignant melanoma, spindle cell sarcomatoid carcinoma and from a number of spindle cell sarcomas of varying lines of differentiation. Spindle cell and sclerosing RMS in adults arise predominantly in the head and neck region and on the extremities, and are composed of atypical spindled cells and scattered rhabdomyoblasts. Since spindle cell RMS may contain areas of lower cellularity with abundant sclerosing stroma, and sclerosing RMS may show focal areas of increased cellularity, it is most likely that both forms represent a morphological spectrum of a single RMS variant.","1481":"Epithelioid sarcoma represents a rare sarcoma with a poor long-term prognosis that arises predominantly on the distal extremities of young adult patients, often mimicking a benign, non-neoplastic condition. Histologically, epithelioid sarcoma is characterized by a multinodular growth with central necrosis, and the neoplasms are composed of relatively uniform epithelioid tumour cells showing a coexpression of vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen and pancytokeratin, and in about half of the cases of CD34. Interestingly, most cases of epithelioid sarcoma show a loss of INI1, whereas the inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene SMARCB1\/INI1 is only rarely caused by mutation. The proximal variant of epithelioid sarcoma is composed of confluent sheets of enlarged epithelioid and rhabdoid tumour cells and represents the morphological progression of this entity. The fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma as well as the angiomatoid and myxoid variants of epithelioid sarcoma are rare morphological variants and need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of other benign and malignant neoplasms.","1482":"Pathological diagnosis is essential today for the individualized therapy of colorectal cancer. In the routine analysis of colorectal carcinomas the molecular-pathological detection of a KRAS mutation predicts unresponsiveness to EGFR-targeted antibody therapies. Moreover, the detection of mismatch-repair deficiency or high-degree microsatellite instability indicates unresponsiveness to 5-FU monotherapy. Colorectal carcinomas with high-grade microsatellite instability and their associated morphologic subtypes, such as the medullary carcinoma, exhibit a low risk of distant metastasis and might be considered as carcinomas with low need for adjuvant chemotherapy.","1483":"Tumor biological parameters for the prediction and prognosis of invasive breast cancer are gaining in importance compared to traditional pathological categories. The immunohistochemically determined steroid hormone receptor status is not only the decisive factor influencing whether endocrine therapy (which is indicated in cases of even slight expression) is given or not, but also whether chemotherapy is considered. The Her2 status is of similar importance and needs to be analysed in every case of invasive carcinoma, whereby reproducibility, which requires greater efforts than with steroid hormone receptors, has to be assured. Probably only a small portion of breast cancers will benefit from chemotherapy. Since traditional pathological categories are not sufficient for the identification of this subgroup, there has been an intense search for alternative prognostic parameters, whereby gene expression profiling has emerged as the most promising tool. Despite minimal concordance with regard to single genes, the various profiles available converge in the identification of the proliferative signature as the prognostically most relevant. Whether histopathological grading and immunohistochemical determination of the growth fraction with Ki-67 or genetic profiling will be more reliable in the identification of the aggressive subtype has yet to be clarified in clinical studies which encompass central pathological review.","1484":"The discovery of activating oncogenic C-KIT and PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) represented the key for the development of innovative targeted molecular therapy using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) Imatinib (Glivec(R)), Sunitinib and other substances. This makes a precise histopathological diagnosis a major prerequisite, supplemented by appropriate risk stratification for the assessment of the expected biological behavior of individual tumors. Current knowledge demonstrates that the presence of kinase mutations in C-KIT and PDGFRA and their localization within the gene sequence as well as the mutation type are of great importance for planning appropriate treatment (drug selection and dose recommendation), but also for the assessment of prognosis and explanation of secondary resistance to TKI after initial response. This article gives an overview on current developments in the histopathological and molecular diagnostics of GIST and the role of kinase mutation analysis for optimizing patient treatment.","1485":"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a very aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. The recently identified Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is present in the majority of MCCs. MCPyV clonally integrates in the tumor DNA and tumor-specific viral mutations are detected within the large T-antigen. To elucidate a possible role of MCPyV in the pathogenesis of other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), i.e. squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma we tested a group of these tumors in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. In addition we tested MCPyV-positive tumors for viral mutations within the large T-antigen. MCPyV DNA was significantly more frequently detected in the NMSC of the immunosuppressed patients (p&lt;0.001). No tumor specific mutations were found within the large T-antigen. The presence of the virus in tumor cells was confirmed by FISH analysis. Although MCPyV is present in the tumor cells of squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and basal cell skin carcinoma, further investigations into the role of MCPyV in the pathogenesis of these tumors is needed.","1486":"","1487":"The serrated pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis is heterogeneous with respect to its precursor lesions, molecular alterations and its prognosis. The low-risk-subtype of serrated adenocarcinomas is less frequent (&lt;20% of all serrated adenocarcinomas) and characterized by proximal location, BRAF-mutation, high CpG-island methylation with loss of MLH1-expression and MSI-H phenotype. The assumed precursor lesion of this subtype is the sessile serrated adenoma and the 5-year overall survival is &gt;70%. The high-risk-subtype is more frequent (&gt;80% of all serrated adenocarcinomas) and characterized by distal location, KRAS mutation, MSI-L\/MSS phenotype, lower CpG-island methylation, and possible p53 accumulation. The assumed precursor lesion is the traditional serrated adenoma and the prognosis is unfavorable (&lt;30% 5-year overall survival). The analysis of MSI status, KRAS and BRAF mutational status and immunohistochemical analyses of hMLH1 and p53 expression enables the distinction between these two subtypes and is therefore clinically relevant, especially since treatment options for the two subtypes may differ in the future.","1488":"Biopsy diagnosis of early and highly differentiated liver tumors is one of the most challenging tasks in histopathology. During recent years its parameters have changed fundamentally due to shifting clinical algorithms. Modern histopathology has met this challenge by defining new, prognostically relevant subtypes of early hepatocellular carcinoma and by elaborating morphological algorithms and novel immunohistological markers for the differential diagnosis of highly differentiated hepatocellular tumors. In addition, a new, predictive molecular pathological and histological classification of liver cell adenoma has been developed. By means of the consequent application of these new diagnostic tools, together with the so-called 'matrix diagnosis', a reliable diagnosis is achieved in the vast majority of these difficult cases.","1489":null,"1490":"Sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents a heterogeneous tumor, which is traditionally classified into subtypes based on morphological criteria. In recent years high-throughput molecular analyses have been able to identify genomic and proteomic alterations in tumor cells. These markers are the basis for a molecular classification of RCC and bear prognostic value. However, an isolated consideration of genomic and proteomic alterations prevents deeper insights into the complex processes of carcinogenesis. Here we summarize recent studies focussing on this aspect of RCC and present a systems biology concept for the identification of novel tumor markers. These could be applied to improve future diagnosis and therapy of RCC.","1491":"EGFR mutations and EGFR gene copy number are considered as predictive markers for response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).NSCLC are often diagnosed by cytology alone. The isolation or selection of a pure tumour cell population is critical for mutation analysis by PCR and sequencing in order to avoid an admixture of tumour DNA with normal DNA of adjacent benign cells. The collection of tumour cells is easily possible by laser microdissection (LMD).EGFR FISH analysis on cytological specimens with a high proportion of benign respiratory cells should be performed after automated relocation of carcinoma cells. The only hitherto established EGFR-FISH criteria were developed using histological specimens and cannot be applied to cytological specimens as such. The cell nuclei in cytological specimens are intact, while they are often truncated in histological specimens. Therefore, when applying the Colorado criteria, the rate of FISH positive results is higher in cytological than in histological specimens and in fact represents false positive results in cytology.Cytological specimens are equally well suited for EGFR gene analyses and FISH analysis as histological specimens. At present, the value of EGFR-FISH analysis is limited by the lack of validated criteria for FISH positivity.","1492":"Serous carcinomas develop at various sites of the Mullerian system, in particular, the ovaries, the peritoneum, the uterus and the fallopian tubes. Currently, two distinctive molecular genetic pathways are distinguished for serous tumorigenesis: type I tumors are typically well differentiated and gradually develop from cystadenoma through borderline tumor to low grade carcinoma and are characterized by B-raf and K-ras mutations, whereas the poorly differentiated type II tumors develop from intraepithelial carcinoma and show p53 mutations. Infrequently, p53 mutations occur as a late event in the type I pathway and lead to a high grade tumor phenotype. A histologically inconspicuous possible precursor lesion of the intraepithelial carcinoma is the p53 signature that shows p53 overexpression without cell cycle deregulation. Whereas in the ovaries both pathways may occur and develop from inclusions of the surface epithelium, the fallopian tube has recently been described as an important site for the type II pathway. High grade serous carcinomas and intraepithelial carcinomas of the tubal fimbria are particularly found in patients with BRCA1\/BRCA2 germ line mutations. Since an advanced tumor stage is frequent and often makes the determination of the origin impossible, the term pelvic serous carcinoma was recently proposed for high grade serous (adeno)carcinomas involving multiple sites.","1493":"","1494":"In the majority of cases the diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is straightforward. In \"monomorphic\" types of PA problems may result: Epithelial-rich PA need to be distinguished from basal cell adenoma or canalicular adenoma. PA dominated by mesenchymal, spindle-shaped differentiation need to be distinguished from myoepithelioma or soft tissue tumours like schwannoma. Focal biphasic-tubular differentiation with CK7\/18-positive ductal cells is good evidence for a tumour within the wide spectrum of PA. Focal peripheral pseudoinfiltration can represent physiological growth pattern of PA; this may render a difficult distinction from low-malignant carcinomas like adenoid-cystic or epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, harbouring also tubular structures. The different progression steps of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CEPA), starting with intraductal carcinoma, are highly relevant with respect to prognosis and therapy. Early stages including CEPA with minor extracapsular invasion show favourable prognosis, while cases with extensive extracapsular invasion carry a dismal prognosis.","1495":"","1496":"","1497":"Both pathologists and clinicians are challenged by the diagnosis of a particular variant of the peripheral adenocarcinoma with involvement of the pleura parietalis, the so-called pseudo-mesotheliomatous adenocarcinoma of the lung (PMAC), which is hard to differentiate from epithelioid mesothelioma on imaging and cytology, macroscopically as well as histologically. However, the exact diagnosis is not only crucial for the patient's therapy but also for insurance matters. Immunohistochemical evaluation represents a quick and a relatively cheap tool for which a few antibody panels have been proposed in recent years as being suitable to distinguish between these two entities. One of the positive markers for epithelioid mesothelioma most often suggested seems to be calretinin. We would like to report on a case of PMAC with the special feature of positive calretinin immunohistochemical staining. Using histochemistry and a few additional antibodies we were able to reliably characterize the tumor and provide the patient with appropriate therapy. This article gives a short overview of the possibilities available for distinguishing between these two entities in the context of a case report.","1498":"","1499":"The rare entity of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) belongs to a group of tumors with a biphasic ductular growth pattern, mostly with a dominating myoepithelial component and low-grade malignancy. We report on the rare constellation of a primary low-malignant EMC with high malignant transformation (so-called dedifferentiation) into a highly malignant myoepithelial carcinoma. In the eight published cases so far, the high-malignant component was reported to be either adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma or was otherwise not specified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a high-grade myoepithelial carcinoma transforming from a low-grade EMC. We discuss interesting parallels to the pathogenesis of secondary transformation of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.","1500":"Myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma are characterized by typical chromosomal translocations. This genetic alteration might result in specific gene-expression profiles in this tumor entity. To identify over-expressed genes in myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma DNA microarray analysis was performed on four tumors and four samples of adult fat tissue. Genes ret, cdk4, cyclin D2 and c-myc showed over-expression by means of microarray analysis and Northern blotting. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic localization of associated proteins in 36 different tumors. The localization of ret was seen in endothelial cells of plexiform vasculature in addition to its accumulation in tumor cells (25% of cases). The results show an over-expression of cdk4, cyclin D2, c-myc and ret on both the transcriptional and protein level in myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma. For cyclin D2 and ret this finding has not been reported in this tumor type. The increase of ret on transcriptional level might be explained by its expression in endothelium in intratumoral plexiform blood vessels. For the molecular pathogenesis of myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma our findings imply the involvement of these four genes in the deregulation of the cell cycle, especially as cdk4 and cyclin D2 are target genes of c-myc.","1501":"Reliable detection of poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma and the detection of carcinoma in situ, which is often invisible by cystoscopy, are the undisputed strength of urinary cytology. In contrast, well-differentiated urothelial tumors are often missed by cytology. We suggest the following classification: negative, questionable, suspicious, and positive. Due to the complex clinico-pathological associations, the classification should always be accompanied by an appropriate commentary. The WHO 2004 classification separates the clinically less important low-grade tumors from the clinically relevant high-grade tumors, usually classified as \"positive\" by cytology. A cytological diagnosis of low-grade tumors by cytology is of minor clinical importance. Most urothelial neoplasias are characterized by chromosomal aberrations. This makes multi-target fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay suitable for the clarification of non-definitive cytology. In contrast, positive cytology does not need further confirmation by FISH analysis. Standardized diagnosis and the possibility for supplementary analyses increase the diagnostic value of urinary cytology.","1502":"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) represents the most common malignant salivary gland tumour. Based on the proportion of their constituent cell types, MECs may display a wide morphological spectrum, thereby mimicking diverse types of other primary salivary gland carcinomas. The correct diagnosis relies on demonstration of classical MEC features, assisted by histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in equivocal cases. The current article aims to demonstrate, on the basis of own observations, how the detection of the MEC-typical t(11, 19) translocation may be of great value in difficult-to-classify cases. The differential diagnosis includes squamous cell carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma and oncocytic neoplasms, as well as highly malignant adenocarcinomas which cannot be further classified.","1503":"","1504":"\"Cancer of unknown primary (site)\" (CUP) represents a frequent and often difficult task for diagnostic histopathology. In the initial CUP situation, immunohistochemistry, which is relatively cost-efficient and non-burdensome for the patient, contributes substantially to the targeted search for and identification of the primary tumor. It may be performed in a two-step algorithm (keratins as the first step, group and selective markers as the second step). However, in true CUP syndrome--a heterogeneous disease whose etiology and pathogenesis is still poorly understood--the primary tumor is rarely identified, and the immunohistochemical marker profile is often anomalous. Nevertheless, immunohistochemistry remains the most important special method, aiming at the phenotypical classification and particularly the identification of certain favorable therapy-responsive subsets. Novel methods for subtyping of CUP based on the analysis of gene expression profiles need to be further evaluated before their possible diagnostic application. Future basic and clinical research is required to unravel the still enigmatic tumor biology of the CUP syndrome and to improve the hitherto very unfavorable prognosis by developing new efficient therapy regimens.","1505":"","1506":null,"1507":"At present the diagnosis of prostate cancer is carried out by transrectally obtained biopsy samples. The histological findings, the value for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the serum, and the clinical stage are the objective criteria for all subsequent therapy decisions. In over 95% of cases an acinar \"usual\" form of prostate cancer is diagnosed but can be very different in characteristics and differentiation. In order to correctly assess prostate cancer and to be able to select the best possible therapeutic measures resulting from the diagnosis, all information obtained from the biopsy must be used to a maximum. The demands on the optimal biopsy findings have considerably expanded in recent years. It must be able to obtain all additional biological, molecular and genetic findings from the biopsy material.","1508":"","1509":"Urothelial tumors of the renal pelvis and the ureter do not differ from those of the urinary bladder concerning histopathological phenotypes. However, with respect to tumor biology there are relevant differences between the two tumor locations. The originating tissue (urothelium) of the bladder and of the upper urinary tract varies significantly with respect to developmental origin, morphology and physiological function. Specific pathways of tumorigenesis (e.g. hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) and tumor propagation (seeding) are described for tumors of the upper urinary tract. Clinical epidemiological data indicate specific correlations between the two tumor locations.","1510":"Breast cancers with a genetic BRCA1-\/BRCA2 background differ from each other and sporadic cases. A specific pathological surrogate marker, however, does not exist. In this study the results of a German reference centre are reported. BRCA1 associated cancers are predominantly high grade (G3), triple negative, highly proliferative (median Ki-67 55%) and only exceptionally accompanied by lobular intraepithelial neoplasia. Cancers with a BRCA2 germ line mutation are less frequent and resemble sporadic cases with a comparably higher proliferative activity and a lack of Her2 overexpression.","1511":"Immunohistochemistry has become an indispensible tool in biopsy diagnostics of prostate tissues. In particular the use of basal cell markers can be useful to differentiate benign and malignant lesions as a lack of basal cells is considered a hallmark of malignancy. Basal cell cytokeratins and p63 have therefore a long standing place in the diagnostic portfolio of most genito-urinary pathologists. However, to complement the use of these negative markers by additional positive immunohistochemistry markers of malignancy would be desirable to further increase diagnostic accuracy. The most widely used positive marker is alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), which is strongly upregulated in prostate cancer and which can even be combined with p63 in a single immunostaining. This article briefly and critically reviews current diagnostic prostate cancer biomarkers and also suggests golgi phosphoprotein 2 (GOLPH2) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) as additional diagnostic markers.","1512":"The molecular genetic background of salivary gland neoplasms has not been characterized in detail to date. However, interesting target genes which could be used as prognostic and diagnostic molecular biomarkers have already been identified, e.g. CRTC1-MAML2 in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, or PLAG1 and HMGA2 in pleomorphic adenoma. In particular, CRTC1-MAML2 has shown strong diagnostic and prognostic potential in recent years. One of the major advantages of molecular tumor markers is that valid results are obtained on minute cell and\/or tissue samples. Due to high-throughput techniques like comparative genome hybridization (CGH), micro- or gene profiling array detection of new marker genes can be expected in the future. This is also true for the most frequent malignant salivary gland tumors after the mucoepidermoid carcinoma, i.e. adenoid cystic carcinomas and acinic cell carcinomas.","1513":"We present the unusual case of a cytologically diagnosed Warthin tumor (WT) of long standing with sudden enlargement und subsequent resection. Histologically, the diagnosis of WT was confirmed, but the tumor additionally showed diffuse infiltrates of an adenocarcinoma undergoing unrestrained growth. Warthin tumor with malignant transformation was suspected and radiological staging examinations were conducted. PET scans detected a metastasizing carcinoma of the breast, morphologically identical to the WT infiltrates. Care should always be taken when the diagnosis of malignant WT is made to exclude metastatic disease.","1514":"Sialolipoma is a relatively new and rare variant of lipoma of the salivary glands characterized by the combination of classical lipoma morphology with non-neoplastic ductulo-acinary salivary tissue components. Including the presented case, 27 sialolipomas, 14 of them localized in the parotid gland, have been published. We describe the clinical, radiological and pathomorphological characteristics of a parotid sialolipoma in a 43-year-old man.","1515":"Theoretical pathology refers to the attempt to reintroduce methodical approaches from the humanities, philosophical logic and \"gestalt philosophy\" into medical research and pathology. Diseases, in particular disease entities and more complex polypathogenetic mechanisms of disease, have a \"gestalt quality\" due to the significance of their pathophysiologic coherence: they have a \"gestalt\". The Research group Theoretical Pathology at the Academy of Science in Heidelberg are credited with having revitalized the philosophical notion of \"gestalt\" for morphological and pathological diagnostics. Gestalt means interrelated schemes of pathophysiological significance in the mind of the diagnostician. In pathology, additive and associative diagnostic are simply not possible without considering the notion of synthetic entities in Kant's logic.","1516":"","1517":"","1518":"Numerous data indicate that defects in apoptotic signaling pathways contribute to the development of cancer and to therapy resistance in many types of malignant tumors. Defective apoptotic cell death is not only a significant cause of cancer, but also increases tumor resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular basis of apoptosis resistance and to develop novel strategies to overcome this resistance. One important task is the identification of those anti-apoptotic proteins that render tumor cells resistant to therapy and to investigate how these resistance mechanisms can be regulated on a cellular and molecular level. Based on these findings, novel strategies to sensitize cancer cells to cell death induction can be developed. Moreover, the expression profiles of several apoptosis-regulating proteins can be used as prognostic factors in patients with diverse types of cancer.","1519":"The systemic amyloidoses comprise a large group of serious protein deposition diseases. Although rather rare, the disorders are spread all over the world. Increasing understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and recent hope for treatment options demand further research and development of diagnostic procedures. The European Union Framework 6 program EURAMY (http:\/\/www.EURAMY.org) is devoted to all aspects of research on systemic amyloidoses, from molecular aspects to treatment of patients.","1520":"The exact classification of amyloid in surgical pathology specimens is complicated by the increasing number of amyloid diseases, with more than 25 different currently known amyloid proteins. Special attention has to be paid to distinguishing hereditary amyloidosis from AL amyloidosis. For this reason we started several years ago to search specifically for hereditary amyloidoses by improving the immunohistochemical classification of amyloid with new antibodies and by applying molecular biology. Since then we have found various cases of systemic and local amyloid diseases in Germany, including, AApoAI-, AFib-, AKer-, ALys- and ATTR-amyloidosis, as well as hitherto unknown amyloidoses. Based on an increasing number of referrals we also collected substantial numbers of cases, which allowed a direct comparison of the prevalences of the various amyloid diseases in organ biopsies.","1521":"Clinical investigations with imaging- and endoscopic techniques in order to identify the primary tumor sites in patients with CUP syndrome generally entail a significant diagnostic effort. If costs exceed &lt;euro&gt; 800.00, a financial loss ensues for German hospitals, as public health insurance companies do not reimburse above this amount. Combined cytological\/immunocytochemical investigation of metastatic cancer cells represents a cost-effective, minimally invasive procedure to identify the probable primary cancer site that can be applied on an outpatient basis. We report on 85 fine needle aspiration biopsies of metastases to the liver, 30 to the lymph nodes and over 180 serous effusions and\/or ascites with metastatic cancer cells in CUP. After conventional microscopic inspection, a routine panel of six monoclonal antibodies was applied (CK 5\/6, CK 7, CK 20, Cdx 2, TTF 1 and CA 125). We were thus able to correctly identify the primary tumor sites in 90.3%, 92.0% and 85.1%, respectively, within three days. In total, 23 primary hepatocellular carcinomas could all be classified correctly, applying the antibodies HepPar 1, BerEp 4, AFP, CD 31, CD 68 and Ki 67. In addition, 141 malignant epithelial mesotheliomas were typed correctly in 97.1%, using the antibodies BerEp 4, Calretinin, Mesothelin, EMA and WT. Therefore, immunocytochemical investigation of metastatic cancer cells from fine needle aspiration biopsies or in serous effusions offers an efficient, cost-effective diagnostic alternative to imaging and endoscopic techniques in the workup of patients with CUP syndrome.","1522":"Matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry is a new method for investigating the distribution of proteins and small molecules within biological systems through the in situ analysis of tissue sections using MALDI-TOF (time-of-flight) mass spectometry. The power of this technology lies in its capability to reliably combine protein data with specific cellular regions within the tissue. For the molecular image analysis, tissue samples are measured in a raster-like process in the mass spectrometer and for each spot a mass spectrum is obtained from molecules within the irradiated area. Software tools generate a mass spectrometry image or molecular weight-specific map of the sample at any desired molecular weight value and the presence and location of proteins and peptides are visualized in the tissue.There are three main fields of application, comprising molecular histology, screening for new biomarkers, and detection of drugs and their metabolites directly in the tissue.","1523":"","1524":"Despite the undisputed and impressive success which has been achieved since the 1960s by cervical cytology in the fight against cervical cancer and its precursor stages, during which the mortality rate in industrialized countries over the last 40 years has been reduced by two-thirds to three-quarters, a perfect and error-free screening procedure is still a long way off and will probably never be reached. There are two main reasons for this, the lack of adequate coverage and suboptimal quality and assessment of smears. Two screening procedures are in use Europe, an opportunistic and an organized system. Both systems have many advantages but also disadvantages. In organized programs the coverage is higher (up to 80%), although similar numbers are also achieved by non-organized programs over a 3-year cycle, even if they cannot be so exactly documented. The decision on which system is used depends on the health system of the country, public or non-public, and many other national circumstances. However, in both systems prerequisites for a satisfactory result is a high quality in the sampling technique, the processing and the assessment. Therefore, several guidelines have been introduced by state and medical societies for internal and external quality assurance. New technologies, such as thin-layer cytology or automation for replacement or support of conventional cytology liquid-based cytology proved not to be superior enough to justify the high costs of these systems. The recognition of the strong causal relationship between persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types and cervical cancer and its precursors has resulted in the development of comparably simple tests. Primary screening using HPV typing alone is not recommended in opportunistic screening due to the low specificity but high sensitivity because it leads to many clinically irrelevant results which place women under stress. In organized screening HPV testing is always and only possible in combination with cytology. Various models and approaches are in the testing phase and appear promising. HPV testing is on the other hand well accepted and recommended as a triage test to select women with equivocal smear results (Pap group III, ASCUS) if a biopsy is required or can be followed up and also for follow-up of patients after cone biopsy. However, vaccination of young girls against oncogenic HPV types which has now become widespread still leaves many questions open for the future because the observation period is too short. There is justified hope that this will become a valuable tool in cervical cancer control and may lead to a substantial reduction in the burden of cervical cancer in the future. However, as the current vaccines on the market do not cover all oncogenic virus types and the effects of vaccination will only be observed after many years, the necessity of a cytological screening will remain unrestricted. Therefore, cervical cytology will remain as the trusted, simple to use, economic and proven, like no other method for early cancer detection, efficient procedure even in the foreseeable future. If carried out with the highest quality demands it will play a central role in the early detection of cervical cancer.","1525":"Five percent of cancer cases present as metastases. If the primary tumor cannot be identified after diagnostic workup, the disease is referred to as cancer of unknown primary (CUP) and is classified as C80.9 according to ICD-10. In Germany, CUP is among the ten most common causes of tumor-related death, with mortality similar to mortality in gastric or pancreatic cancer. Biopsies of the tumor manifestation are generally examined histopathologically and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Gene expression profiling (GEP) is a new diagnostic technique that might further contribute to tumor specification.In a retrospective study, 43 CUP cases underwent central immunohistochemical review and centrally performed GEP using a classifier based on 495 genes. There was concordance between IHC, GEP and clinical picture in 54% of cases. In four cases, the combination of methods led to an unequivocal identification of the primary tumor.In conclusion, we regard detailed IHC workup and complementary GEP advisable for the purposes of targeted therapy, as well as to identify or exclude specific tumors in a CUP situation.","1526":"Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFP) are proliferations of CD34-positive spindle cells in the submucosa and mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract with an inflammatory infiltrate. IFP occur in the stomach, small bowel, colon and esophagus. To date, etiology and pathogenesis are unclear. A total of 29 IFP originating in the stomach, small bowel and colon were examined immunohistochemically, and mutational analyses of PDGFRA exons 10, 12, 14 and 18 were conducted. Activating mutations in PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 were found in 20 cases (69%). The mutational types are related to mutations known from gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). D842V was the most frequent mutation. No activating mutations were found in exons 10 and 14. The majority of IFP reveal activating PDGFRA mutations. Our data indicate that IFP are true neoplasms (true benign tumors) and not reactive lesions. In terms of pathogenesis, the relationship between PDGFRA-mutant GISTs and IFP remains to be determined.

With the discovery and cloning of cytoskeleton proteins and intermediate filaments in the muscle fiber membrane, the sarcoplasm and the nucleus which are essential for the normal muscle fiber function, the classification of muscular dystrophies has dramatically improved. Muscular dystrophies are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders. By means of immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics more than 40 different disease forms can be distinguished, which are characterised by distinct protein defects or defined gene loci and can be related to typical phenotypes. It is noteworthy that muscular dystrophies may be associated with cardiomyopathy with increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Thus, diagnosis and treatment require experienced investigators and clinicians and regular cardiologic follow-ups, preferably in a specialised muscle center.","1533":"Various histological techniques were introduced for the analysis of muscle biopsy specimens in recent decades. During the 1960s, cryosections and enzyme histochemistry were established as the main techniques for evaluating muscle biopsies. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry was able to show normal components of muscle fibre, its damage, as well as accumulation or maldistribution in the presence of myopathies. In this way, structure myopathies, muscle dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies can be reliably diagnosed today. For the diagnosis of certain entities, semithin sections and electron microscopy of resin-embedded tissue, as well as molecular pathological techniques including immunoblotting and PCR are useful. To apply these and other methods optimally with the goal of achieving a diagnosis some prerequisites need to be met: a moderately affected muscle has to be chosen and a 3x1x1 cm biopsy should be taken by an experienced surgeon in an atraumatic way and transported immediately in a moist chamber to the nearest specialized laboratory. The muscle specimen is divided into four pieces, two of which are snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (one with OCT mounting medium on a cork plate, the other without mounting medium); the third piece is fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The fourth is fixed in glutaraldehyde and embedded in resin. The logistical problems of a muscle biopsy need to be solved between clinicians and the analysis center prior to removal.","1534":"The myopathies presented here fall into two groups: Congenital myopathies and protein aggregate myopathies. These genetic conditions often require all modern diagnostic investigations, including histology, enzyme histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to pave the way to an adequate individual molecular analysis and diagnosis. This is necessary to provide the patient and his or her family information about disease-characteristics or even disease-specific features. Distal myopathies, although caused by mutations in different genes, and toxic myopathies as acquired neuromuscular conditions largely provide non-specific morphological features a correct nosological interpretation of which only succeeds with additional non-morphological data.","1535":"","1536":"Metabolic disorders of energy production characterise the group of rare, mainly autosomal recessively inherited metabolic muscular diseases which are often associated with multi-systemic symptoms. In this report, an update on the clinics, pathophysiology, pathomorphology and current treatment options of metabolic myopathies will be given. Beyond classic phenotypes of these disorders, one should be aware of oligosymptomatic patients who can be easily missed. The relevant gene mutations and the pathophysiology and pathomorphology they cause are now known for almost all these metabolic diseases. Establishing the correct diagnosis has become even more important since highly specific therapy options are now available for at least some of these inherited disorders, e.g. enzyme replacement therapy in Pompe disease.","1537":"Neurogenic muscular atrophy (NMA) is the most frequent diagnosis obtained from reading a muscle biopsy. It is characterized by specific histological changes which distinguish NMA from other important muscle pathologies including the primary myopathies such as the muscular dystrophies as well as the inflammatory muscle disorders. Within the group of denervation atrophies, NMAs due to motor neuron diseases are associated with particular histological patterns. The diagnosis of NMA in muscle biopsies requires special methods, mainly enzyme and immunohistochemistry, but also resin histology and in some cases electron microscopy. Analysis of a combined muscle and sural nerve biopsy provides the opportunity to compare the extent of degeneration in the motor and sensory systems, respectively. Muscle fiber typing by enzyme and immunohistochemistry also leads to the detection of selective type 1 and type 2 muscle fiber atrophies which are relevant in the differential diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.","1538":"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are diseases that are potentially amenable to immunomodulatory therapy. The challenge for the neuropathologist consists in distinguishing these myopathies from secondary inflammatory myopathies, especially in the context of some muscular dystrophies and metabolic diseases that may also show inflammatory infiltrates. There are generalized IIMs (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, sporadic inclusion body myositis) and focal ones (e.g., proliferative myositis, macrophagic myofasciitis). This review provides diagnostic criteria for each of these and includes pathogenetic mechanisms where available.","1539":"","1540":"The differential diagnosis of villous forms of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) includes hydropic abortion, complete and partial hytatidiform mole and placental mesenchymal dysplasia. In addition to histologic criteria, p57(KIP2) immunohistochemistry might be helpful. Choriocarcinoma represents the most immature form of GTD. This and downregulation of HSP-27 might contribute to the high chemosensitivity, compared to placental site (PSTT) and epitheloid trophoblastic tumor (ETT). Within the differential diagnosis of the non-villous forms of GTD an algorithmic approach of immunohistochemistry is very helpful. With an incidence of 1.6% of all abortions within the first trimester the exaggerated placental site reaction (EPS) is rare. There is no molecular indication that the EPS represents a precursor lesion of PSTT. The morphologic prediction of the behaviour of PSTT is not well established. Factors which might be associated with adverse outcome are age &gt;35 years, interval since last pregnancy &gt;2 years, growth outside the uterus, deep myometrial invasion, destructive growth, extensive coagulative necrosis, presence of cells with clear cytoplasm, high mitotic rate and a Ki-67 labeling index &gt;50%.

Possible etiologies include primary systemic vasculitis, secondary vasculitis or isolated single organ vasculitis. Key criteria of morphological vasculitis work-up are vessel size, type of inflammation (granulomatous, necrotizing and\/or leukocytoclastic) as well as presence or absence of immune complexes and extravascular inflammatory changes. Together with the typical organ involvement and serological data, these criteria constitute the basis of vasculitis classification. A histopathologically confirmed biopsy is the gold standard for a diagnosis of vasculitis, although a definite diagnosis can frequently not be made solely on histopathological grounds. Differential diagnostic overlaps and possible ways of discrimination are presented. In many cases, however, histopathology can only provide a definite diagnosis in combination with clinical and serological data. A conclusive morphological diagnosis depends on the right time of biopsy and selection of appropriate biopsy material.","1544":"","1545":"There are many common features between uterine sarcomas - leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stromal sarcoma, undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma and adenosarcoma -with regards to course, therapy and follow-up, such as post-menopausal bleeding or additional premenopausal bleeding, as well as rapid growth. There is a new staging system according to FIGO and new therapy recommendations according to NCCN. Prior to therapy, imaging staging of the pelvis, abdomen and chest should be carried out due to the frequency with which metastases are found at the time of diagnosis. In the case of disease spread in uterine sarcomas and malignant mixed tumors, good supportive therapy is a possible therapy option instead of chemo- or radiotherapy. The approach - observation, surgery, lymphonodectomy, mono- or polychemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy - is chosen according to the extent of spread and the resection status. Neoadjuvant therapies are not as yet established.","1546":"","1547":"","1548":"Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is the most frequent nodal lymphoma in Europe. The B-cell derived Hodgkin-Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells are nearly completely deficient for expression of B-cell markers. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be detected in about 40% of HL cases. Presumably, EBV protects HRS cell precursors from apoptosis. Histologically only single HRS cells are dispersed in a broad reactive cellular background. Interactions between HRS cells and their surrounding cellular infiltrate, among them paracrine activation of several signalling pathways, is crucial in HL. HRS cells also show autocrine activation of several signalling pathways. Among these, the aberrant expression and activation of seven different receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) is of special interest, as many different antibodies and low molecular substances which inhibit RTK activity are already in clinical use for anticancer therapy. Therefore, blocking of RTK activities in HL may be a novel therapeutic option.","1549":"Most cases of endometrial cancer (EC) become symptomatic at an early stage and have a good prognosis. EC has been traditionally treated with total abdominal hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. For early stage, low grade cases (endometrioid, pT1a, pT1b; G1, G2) this is adequate therapy. For higher stages and grades, especially for type II EC (serous, clear cell) this therapy is insufficient. The efficacy of systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy for high risk EC, however, remains to be evaluated. External pelvic radiotherapy has been shown to improve local control in stage I and II EC, but has no positive effect on survival. A comparable improvement of local control can be achieved by vaginal brachytherapy with significantly less toxicity. Adjuvant chemotherapy is probably efficacious in EC. Its usefulness as exclusive adjuvant therapy or in combination with brachytherapy and\/or external beam therapy remains to be evaluated by prospective trials.","1550":"Uterine stromal neoplasms are classified into endometrial stromal nodules and stromal sarcomas, as well as undifferentiated sarcomas. The two former groups demonstrate identical histological composition, consisting of small monomorphous cells with scant cytoplasm and round nuclei and typically contain numerous arteriolar-type vessels. Stromal tumors are distinct from stromal nodules by virtue of their myometrial and vascular invasion. Undifferentiated sarcomas consist of polymorphic cells and lack any cytological similarity to the stroma of normal proliferative endometrium. There is no smooth or striated muscle differentiation. Adenosarcomas are mixed neoplasms with a low grade stromal sarcoma component containing benign glands, which are surrounded by condensed neoplastic stroma. Typical uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCT Type2) show predominant sex cord differentiation in a well circumscribed nodule. Focal sex cord differentiation may occur in stromal nodules and stromal sarcomas (UTROSCT Type2).","1551":"Malignant mixed Mullerian tumors (MMMT; carcinosarcomas) are rare epithelial-mesenchymal tumors. With an overall survival rate of 30%-40% the prognosis is much worse compared to high grade endometrioid or serous\/clear cell carcinomas. Depending on the histology of the mensenchymal components a distinction is made between homologous and heterologous MMMT. Clinical, morphologic and molecular data suggest that MMMTs are really metaplastic carcinomas in which the mesenchymal part retains epithelial features. The strongest prognostic factor is tumor stage followed by lymph node metastases, deep myometrial infiltration, involvement of the cervix and tumor size. The distinction between homologous and heterologous MMMT is prognostically insignificant. Due to unreliable clinical staging and a high rate of occult lymph node metastases, the pathological-anatomical work-up is of great importance. Clinical and pathologic staging should be performed as in endometrial carcinoma. The main differential diagnoses include uterine sarcomas, adenosarcoma and benign metaplastic change within the endometrium.","1552":"Endometrial carcinomas can be separated into two groups which are designated as type I and type II carcinomas today. Both groups of tumors are clearly different with regard to conventional light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, molecular pathology and clinical features. Only type I carcinomas are associated with hyperestrogenism. The group of type I carcinomas consists of endometrioid carcinoma and its variants, and mucinous carcinoma. The prototypes of type II carcinomas are serous and clear cell carcinoma. Not all carcinomas, however, can be assigned to one of the two groups, because there are hybrid tumors and mixed carcinomas, e.g. endometrioid carcinoma with a serous component. The precursor lesions of the endometrioid carcinoma and the serous carcinoma are well characterized morphologically and by molecular pathology. Atypical hyperplasia is the precursor lesion of endometrioid carcinoma, whereas endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) is the precursor lesion of serous carcinoma. No precursor lesion has as yet been identified for clear cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical markers for endometrial carcinoma are CK7 and vimentin, for serous carcinoma markers are p53 and p16. Correct typing is of essential prognostic necessity in endometrial carcinoma. Of utmost importance is the detection of a serous component, because serous carcinoma leads to early tumor spread with the necessity of radical surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","1553":"Leiomyomas are by far the most frequent mesenchymal uterine neoplasms. Leiomyoma variants refer to a particular histological differentiation and growth pattern, respectively. To assess malignancy, an algorithm is used based on the presence or absence of cellular atypia, tumor cell necrosis and mitosis. In addition, vascular invasion is a criterion for malignancy. Ischemic or infarct type necrosis is not considered a criterion for malignancy. The differential diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma includes cellular and mitotically active leiomyoma and leiomyoma with extensive infarct type necrosis (apoplectic leiomyoma). The term smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) should be reserved for tumors with uncertainty regarding cell type, type of necrosis and mitotic index, as well as for special cases of myxoid and epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms. Immunohistochemically, the expression of desmin and caldesmon is indicative of smooth muscle tumors, while stromal tumors can express smooth muscle actin and, rarely, desmin in addition to CD10.","1554":"","1555":"","1556":null,"1557":"Testosterone secreting tumours of the adrenal glands are usually adrenal carcinomas or adenomas.

In the absence of crystalloids of Reinke this cell population can be identified as Leydig cells based on positive immunohistochemical staining of inhibin and calretinin.","1558":"Giant cell tumor of soft tissue (GCT-ST) is a rare primary soft tissue tumor with low malignant potential. It is clinically and pathologically similar to the giant cell tumor of the bone. Two cases of GCT-ST in surgical scars are reported. Both tumors were initially regarded as tumor relapses of a leiomyosarcoma of deep soft tissue and a dermal in situ squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. The development of GCT-ST in surgical scars has not been observed previously. These findings suggest chronic inflammation and tissue repair as etiological factors in the development of GCT-ST. The period of time between initial surgical intervention and the development of the GCT-ST seems to be unusually short for the development of a \"true\" second neoplasm, which may underline the sometimes diffuse border between reactive \"pseudosarcomatous\" and neoplastic fibro-histiocytic lesions.","1559":"Cardiac amyloidoses are a heterogeneous group of cardiomyopathies that are resistant to treatment and are associated with a poor outcome. Standard heart failure treatment is usually not well tolerated and the underlying disease remains unaffected. The clinical picture is uncharacteristic. Cardiac amyloidosis is often associated with dysfunction of additional organs. Early cardiac amyloid involvement usually reveals left ventricular hypertrophy, impairment of longitudinal shortening and diastolic ventricular function. Without adequate therapy (bi-)ventricular hypertrophy will progress to severe systolic ventricular function decrease. The combination of low voltage pattern, left ventricular hypertrophy and granular sparkling is characteristic for advanced cardiac amyloid involvement. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy yield further information on the pattern and severity of cardiac involvement. In unclear cases (left ventricular) endomyocardial biopsy is necessary. Detection of early cardiac involvement and proper identification of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death due to rapid progressive amyloidosis is still incompletely defined. Referral to specialized centers is strongly recommended.","1560":"","1561":"Some patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) respond well to therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Somatic mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is an important predictive marker for TKI response. We performed EGFR mutation analysis in 307 NSCLC (exon 18-21). The data were analyzed for associations with clinical-pathological parameters. Relevant EGFR mutations were found in 25\/307 NSCLC (8.1%; 178 biopsies and 129 cytologies). Most mutations were found in exon 19 (50%) followed by the L858R point mutation in exon 21 (12.5%). EGFR mutations were significantly more common in women than in men (16.8% vs. 2.7%; p&lt;0.001) and in adenocarcinoma than in other carcinoma subtypes (11.4% vs. 3.8%; p=0.017). EGFR mutation was associated with TTF-1 positivity (p&lt;0.041). Almost all (96%) mutated NSCLC were TTF-1 positive. In Central Europe, the prevalence of relevant EGFR mutations in NSCLC is &lt;10% of patients with NSCLC. EGFR mutations are more common in women and TTF-1 positive adenocarcinomas. Mutation analysis can be performed both from biopsies and cytologies.

This might occur intra- or extracellularly, systemically or in a localized manner. The light chain type is the most common form of systemic amyloidoses and has the worst prognosis. The underlying disease is a monoclonal, mostly non-malignant plasma cell disorder. The causative treatment is the reduction of the amyloidogenic light chains with conventional or high-dose chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the\"new drugs\" used in multiple myeloma are also successfully applied. Early diagnosis is important to be able to treat patients effectively and to avoid further deterioration of organ function. Patients with newly diagnosed amyloidosis should be referred to a specialized center for consultation, diagnosis and treatment recommendation.","1563":"Amyloidoses play an important role in neuropathology, both in autopsies and biopsy specimens. Cerebral amyloidoses are typically characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid and mostly affect patients &gt;60 years. The cardinal symptom of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease is dementia. Rare familial forms of amyloidoses may affect young patients and need thorough neuropathological assessment, similar to the relatively infrequent prion diseases. Amyloidoses within neuromuscular tissues mainly occur in the setting of systemic amyloid diseases. Detailed evaluation including thorough characterisation of amyloid is essential for ensuring the neuropathological diagnosis.","1564":"AA amyloidosis can be the consequence of any chronic inflammatory disorder. It is most commonly associated with chronic inflammatory rheumatic, pulmonary or gastrointestinal diseases, familial Mediterranean fever or other rare periodic syndromes. AA amyloidosis often affects the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and the heart. Effective therapy of the underlying disease can normalize the inflammatory reaction and can slow or inhibit the deterioration of organ function if the diagnosis is made at an early stage of the disease. In rheumatoid diseases and in some periodic syndromes the use of antibodies against TNFalpha or IL-1 beta might be helpful. Patients with familial Mediterranean fever should regularly take colchicine to prevent attacks and to reduce the risk for development or progression of AA amyloidosis. Eprodisate is currently being investigated for AA amyloidosis and renal involvement.","1565":"Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF) cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We were able to examine eight patients suspected of LGMD2B clinically, histochemically. The genotype was determined in every case. We found sarcolemmal and interstitial amyloid deposits in four muscle sections. All of the mutations associated with amyloid were located in the N-terminal region of dysferlin, and dysferlin clearly proved to be a component of the amyloid deposits. Dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy is the first muscular dystrophy in which amyloidosis is involved. This fact must be considered in the process of developing therapeutic strategies. The influence of the amyloid deposits on the pathogenesis of the disease and the possible involvement of other organs in the progressive course are as yet unclear.","1566":"Amyloid is a pathologic fibrillar aggregation of polypeptides in a cross-beta-sheet conformation. Amyloidoses are caused by the deposition of amyloid and may occur as cerebral and extracerebral disease. More than 29 different amyloid proteins have been identified. Analysis of a Congo red-stained tissue section by polarization microscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing amyloid. Subsequent classification of the amyloid is mandatory and is increasingly supported by molecular biological analyses. In Germany, this recently led to the discovery of several hereditary amyloid diseases. The correct classification of amyloid is of paramount importance. This helps to asses the prognosis and plan patient treatment.","1567":"Amyloid and amyloidosis describes a heterogeneous group of diseases which are characterized by the pathological extracellular deposition of autologous proteins. Basically, amyloidoses can be divided into systemic or organ-limited (e.g. cutaneous) forms and can be acquired or hereditary in nature. The subclassification discriminates between primary amyloidosis (in the absence of an obvious predisposing disease) and secondary amyloidosis (if caused by a certain underlying disease). The subclassification of amyloidoses is based on the main protein constituent and therefore on the chemical composition of the amyloid fibrils. However, the exact etiopathogenesis of amyloid formation remains unclear. In addition to the clinical presentation, histology, electron microscopy and biochemical-immunological differentiation are also decisive for a proper diagnosis. In cutaneous amyloidosis the deposition of amyloid either occurs along reticulin fibers and the basal membrane (perireticulary amyloidoses) or along collagen fibers (pericollagenous amyloidosis). The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date overview on the different kinds of cutaneous amyloidoses.","1568":"","1569":"Amyloid fibrils are structurally defined as fibrillar polypeptide aggregates with a characteristic cross-beta structure. Such fibrils can be formed by certain polypeptide sequences in the human body and by numerous polypeptide sequences in vitro. All amyloid fibrils possess a structural spine that is formed by a cross-beta structure. This structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the polypeptide backbone. In recent years, various biophysical techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron cryo-microscopy have provided insights into the structural organization of amyloid fibrils. This review presents an overview of important results obtained with these methods.","1570":null,"1571":"Hereditary hemoglobinopathies should be considered as differential diagnosis when examining placental specimens for fetal growth retardation and spontaneous abortion. They can cause various macroscopic and microscopic changes in the placenta that are relevant for routine pathology examination. The importance of interdisciplinary co-operation between obstetrics and pathology to achieve optimum diagnostics and therapy planning is demonstrated using the case of a pregnant woman with heterozygous genotype and her child with homozygous genotype. Within this context, the influence of hemoglobinopathies on placental pathology and fetal development are summarized and exemplified.","1572":"This overview examines how the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has changed the pathological staging of breast cancer. The more intensive analysis of the sentinel lymph nodes (gross slicing, step sections, immunohistological or molecular analysis) has lead to stage shifting in breast cancer. Regarding the rate of up-staging by positive results of SLNB, there are significant differences between institutes, some method-related, some related to the interpretation of results. Methodological differences should be reduced by means of reliable guidelines with the goal of systematically identifying metastases of a particular size (a macrometastasis over 2 mm being the minimum criterion). The next review of the TNM classification should result in a reduction in interobserver variability as a result of better definitions of staging categories for isolated tumor cells and micrometastases. In addition, a staging category is expected for metastases which have been identified by calibrated quantitative molecular tests only and which are larger than isolated tumors. Even in settings where nodal staging by SLNB is based on molecular tests at least a proportion of the lymph node should be investigated histologically.","1573":"Histological analysis of kidney biopsies is an essential part of our current diagnostic workup of patients with renal disease. Besides the already established diagnostic tools, new methods allow extensive analysis of the sample tissue's gene expression. Using results from a European multicenter study on gene expression analysis of renal biopsies, in this review we demonstrate that this novel approach not only expands the scope of so-called basic research but also might supplement future biopsy diagnostics. The goals are improved diagnosis and more specific therapy choice and prognosis estimates.","1574":"","1575":"","1576":"","1577":"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, encompassing a plethora of histological types and clinical courses. Current histopathological classification systems for breast cancer are based on descriptive entities that are of prognostic significance. Few prognostic markers beyond those offered by histopathological analysis are available. Furthermore, a very limited armamentarium of predictive biomarkers has been introduced in clinical practice. High throughput molecular technologies are reshaping our understanding of breast cancer, of which microarray-based gene expression has received the most attention. This method has been successfully used to derive a molecular taxonomy for breast cancer, which has provided interesting insights into the biology of the disease. Microarray-based class prediction studies have generated a multitude of prognostic\/predictive signatures. Although these signatures have not been fully translated to clinical practice as yet, they herald the promise of an improvement in breast cancer treatment decision-making. It should be noted, however, that most of the signatures developed to date seem to have discriminatory power almost restricted to oestrogen receptor-positive disease. This review addresses the contribution of gene expression profiling to our understanding of breast cancer and its clinical management and what has yet to be done for these classifiers to be incorporated in clinical practice.","1578":"Determining ErbB2\/Her-2\/neu status has become an essential part of breast cancer diagnosis and a prerequisite before considering a patient's eligibility for treatment with trastuzumab. Currently the most common techniques to assess ErbB2 status in routine practice are the identification of receptor overexpression by means of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the analysis of gene amplification by means of dual color fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). According to recent recommendations (\"ASCO\/CAP Guidelines\" and German S3 guidelines for breast cancer) the choice of primary test procedure--IHC or ISH - is left to the individual institution. Both techniques are of equal predictive value provided that strict quality precautions have been taken: internal test validation by comparing IHC and (F)ISH, carrying out controls, and annual participation in round-robin tests. Equivocal IHC (score 2+) has to be checked by ISH for amplification. Borderline ISH (ratio 1.8-2.2 or gene copy number 4.0-6.0) should be retested by counting additional cells or performing IHC. In approximately 5% of cases these criteria give conflicting results and the gene copy number alone generates over 90% of the equivocal ISH cases, mostly due to chromosome 17 polysomy. These cases need to be tested by IHC since over-expression is very exceptional and only these tumors have the potential to be trastuzumab responders.","1579":"Individualized therapeutic regimes are almost exclusively based on the rapid developments in molecular pathology. Application of (additional) molecular pathological investigations may thus offer the unique opportunity to improve the classical morphologic diagnosis as well as to routinely evaluate the parameters (\"biomarkers\") required for therapeutic decision making. Pathologists are thus facing the cogent necessity to perform and develop molecular pathological investigations in high quality and to establish biobanks, as well as to adjust their specialist training accordingly in order to meet these requirements.","1580":"","1581":null,"1582":"The human breast consists of lobes with a luminal glandular and a basal myoepithelial layer. Immunofluorescence studies have shown that the breast epithelium contains cytokeratin (CK)5\/14-positive precursor cells which give rise to CK8\/18-positive glandular or sm-actin-positive myoepithelial cells. Only some of the glandular cells contain estrogen receptors. The luminal epithelium of the lobules shows a much higher glandular differentiation than the ductal system. Diagnostically important cytokeratins of normal breast epithelium and its proliferative epithelial processes include luminal cytokeratins (CK7, CK8 and CK18) as markers of glandular differentiation and basal cytokeratins (CK5, CK14 and CK17) as markers of progenitor cells and early cells of the glandular and myoepithelial differentiation pathway. The most important myoepithelial markers are currently CD10, SMA, SMM-HC and Calponin.","1583":"Proliferative epithelial breast lesions include a wide variety of benign hyperplastic and noninvasive neoplastic lesions, as well as invasive carcinomas. Mammographically these lesions may show microcalcifications, architectural distortions or mass lesions. The task of the pathologist begins with a preoperative diagnosis by means of minimally invasive biopsy. His diagnosis forms the basis for not only the radiological-pathological correlation diagnosis, but also for the management of benign proliferative breast disease lesions, as well as therapeutic decisions in the case of malignant lesions.In daily practice, immunohistochemistry is the method of choice for clarifying difficult cases. The aim of this chapter is to describe the relevant markers in breast pathology and to provide an algorithmic approach to different proliferative breast disease lesions.","1584":"Prognostic factors supply information on the course of a disease (recurrence-free and total survival) and are independent of the therapy. The most important prognostic factors are lymph node status, tumor diameter and histological differentiation stage, lymph and blood vessel invasion as well as staging, factors which can all be determined by pathologists. The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) combines the strongest prognostic factors and according to study results is a suitable model for prognosis of breast cancer. Predictive factors give prior information on the probability of the response of a tumor to a defined therapy and include hormone receptor status, the invasion marker uPA\/PAI-1, detection of isolated tumor cells, a residual tumor and the histological resection border.Prognostic or predictive factors are clinically relevant when therapy decisions are made possible by their recognition, which lead to an improvement in the total survival, recurrence-free survival or quality of life. The international consensus recommendation of St. Gallen 2007 requires the following as a basis for risk-adapted therapy decisions: tumor size, stage, age, nodal status, hormone receptor status and Her2 overexpression or amplification status.","1585":"According to the WHO, flat epithelial atypia (FEA) is defined as a neoplastic epithelial proliferation of ductal type in either a single or in multiple terminal duct lobular unit(s) limited to the periphery of the ductules in a clinging growth pattern. The atypical cells may form between one and several layers of epithelial cells that show low grade cytologic atypia. FEA most often presents as mammographic microcalcifications, which are typically round (secretory type and psammomatous calcification in an eosinophilic matrix, so-called ossifying calcifications). Clinical relevance is dependent on whether the lesion appears in isolation or whether it is an excision biopsy or a minimally invasive biopsy. Currently available data suggest that the risk of subsequent breast carcinoma in the ipsilateral breast is very low following the diagnosis of FEA. The differential diagnosis should include atypical ductal hyperplasia, low-grade clinging ductal carcinoma in situ, blunt duct adenosis and apocrine metaplasia.","1586":"The definition of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) encompasses qualitative and quantitative criteria. Qualitative criteria include cytological and architectural features similar to those of low grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the quantitative criteria are characterized by metric features (2 mm or 2 ductules) or by the confines of lobules. In this article we discuss the morphology of ADH, the status of ADH in the low grade pathway of breast carcinoma development and its clinical significance. Furthermore, we comment some special forms of atypical epithelial proliferations of the ductal type.","1587":"We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with a longstanding history of unspecific hepatomegaly. The morphological investigations were diagnostic of a cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD), a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease with deficient activity of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The combination of hepatomegaly with accumulation of macrophages and ultrastructural evidence of lysosomal lipid storage are groundbreaking for the diagnosis. The probability of a underdiagnosis or false disease classification, for example as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is high, particularly with regard to genetic data which indicate a higher incidence of the disease.","1588":"In the current WHO classification, together with the subtype of combined small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are listed as a special tumour entity. Their microscopic appearance is characterised by small tumour cells with scant cytoplasm and frequently hypodiploid nuclei. For the precise histological diagnosis of SCLC, especially for the diagnostic differentiation from pulmonary NHL infiltrates, additional immunohistochemical investigations are recommended. The presented core classification of lung cancer is intended to facilitate the semi-quantitative registration of \"atypical\" SCLC. Genetically SCLC is especially characterised by manifold chromosomal deletions with losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms, associated with the inactivation of numerous tumour suppressor genes. Whereas the extensive DNA losses may explain the marked sensitivity of SCLC to anti-neoplastic chemotherapy or radiotherapy, its considerable chromosomal instability is correlated with the development of resistance to therapy.","1589":"Within the framework of mammography screening programmes the expertise of the pathologist is embedded in an interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The quality of histopathological diagnosis not only depends on the expertise of the pathologist, but also requires skillful co-operation with the radiologist and the gynecologist who are both responsible for determining the medical indications for further radiographic and surgical tests and must ensure appropriate tissue samples are taken for non-palpable lesions. Bearing this process in mind it becomes clear that increased expertise in interventional tissue sampling leads to histological samples which are more representative. If the samples are not representative, their histological evaluation does not permit a conclusive statement on the origin of tissue abnormalities shown by mammography. At the mammography unit in Wiesbaden it was demonstrated that breast tissue punches almost always allow a precise histological diagnosis of tissue abnormalities and are at the same time appropriate for additional immunohistochemistry, such as for hormone receptors on carcinoma cells. Non-representative tissue samples are the exception.","1590":"Significant cellular alterations required for the development and progression of cancers are detectable at the molecular level and represent potential targets for gene-specific therapies. Modern chip techniques allow the parallel analysis of virtually all known human genes and proteins in a single experiment. Using modern high-throughput techniques, numerous potential new biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of prostate cancer have been identified. However, so far none of these markers has improved clinical practice. One of the most important challenges in the coming years is the extensive clinical validation of molecular data using clinically relevant end points. For this venture the pivotal prerequisite is the availability of large, comprehensively annotated and standardized high-quality bioresources.","1591":"Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is an intriguing clinical finding defined as biopsy-proven metastasis from a malignancy in the absence of an identifiable primary site after a complete clinical workup. CUP is a relatively common clinical entity, accounting for approximately 3-5% of all cancer diagnoses, and consists of a heterogeneous group of tumors that have acquired the capacity to metastasize before the development of a clinically evident primary lesion. The mechanisms responsible for early metastasis and lack of a detectable primary tumor are largely unknown. Although remarkable tools have been developed for immunohistological classification of CUP on the basis of the likely tissue of origin, data on molecular pathogenesis and biology of this disorder are rare. A wide variety of chromosomal aberrations are seen in CUP, with aberrations of chromosomes 1, 6, 7, and 11 having been most frequently described. 66-75% of CUP express epidermal growth factor receptor while overexpression of Her2\/neu seems to be rare. In contrast to most other tumor entities p53 mutations have been found only in a minority of CUP tumors. Recently, several independent studies have demonstrated proof of principle for the use of gene expression microarrays in identifying a primary site for CUP. Therefore, gene expression and also genomic profiling tools represent promising analytical approaches to assist with the management of CUP patients.","1592":"On the basis of varying morphology and pathogenesis, two types of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias (VIN) have been defined: the common type (approximately 98%), classic VIN, is characterised by strong association to high-risk HPV infection (up to 90%), occurrence at younger age (median age 30-40 years) and multifocality. The differentiated (or simplex) type is rare (1%-2%) and is associated with older age (median age 65 years) and p53 alterations. It is usually diagnosed in combination with vulvar (keratinizing) squamous cell carcinoma. The classification currently preferred by the WHO in which VIN are classified into VIN 1-3 is to be replaced due to new data and according to a proposal by the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Diseases (ISSVD) which eliminates VIN 1 and combines VIN 2 and 3 to VIN of common or, depending on histopathology, differentiated type. Prognostically relevant factors in vulvar cancer include stage of disease, inguinal lymph node involvement, size of metastatic deposits and presence of extracapsular extension, depth of invasion and distance of the tumor from resection margins. Tumor grade and the presence of lymphovascular space involvement are controversially discussed.","1593":"Percutaneous kidney biopsy now represents the gold standard for diagnosis of most primary and secondary kidney disease. It allows identification and classification of renal disorders and is the basis for standardized therapeutic concepts. As with any diagnostic method, the value of the data produced depends on experience and reproducible procedures. For kidney biopsy this includes resection and adequate methodologies using representative kidney tissue. The procedures required are shown in detail and discussed.","1594":"Molecular biological tumor markers and prognostic parameters are necessary for differential diagnosis, individual prognosis, and therapy in patients with renal cell tumors. By using high throughput technologies, it is possible to characterize tumor samples comprehensively. Based on specific genetic alterations, histopathological subtypes were defined as independent tumor entities. Genetic characteristics can be used for diagnosis of primary tumor samples and also of biopsies. Furthermore, specific molecular patterns of metastatic tumors are known, allowing the determination of the primary tumor's metastatic potential. The specific protein patterns of serum samples of tumor patients were analyzed, and several candidate proteins have been identified. One of these is SAA-1, which is elevated in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC). New therapeutic options are now available for patients with metastatic RCC. Therefore, it is necessary to select the best therapy for each patient and to detect therapy resistance very early. Biomarkers in tumor tissue and serum were found to correlate with therapy response.","1595":"Patients with cancers of unknown primary (CUP syndrome) represent a relatively large group of cancer patients (5-10%) in whom the histomorphological diagnosis is made from tissue from the metastasis, and the site of the primary tumour remains unclear. The incidence is variable, depending on the definition used and the intensity of the search for a primary tumour. From a biological and prognostic point of view, it is helpful to distinguish eight clinical entities of the CUP syndrome; four of these entities can be subdivided histologically. Histopathologic diagnosis should be performed using a diagnostic algorithm based on the HE morphology and supplemented by immunohistochemistry. With the use of a broad spectrum of immunohistochemical markers, many tumour entities can be diagnosed, so in most cases molecular genetic investigations are not necessary.","1596":"","1597":"A mathematical model of collagen fiber mesh formation was created to evaluate the possible role of chemotaxis and haptotaxis in the histomorphology of a desmoplastic stromal reaction (DSR). Fibroblasts were mathematicaly interpreted as mobile discrete objects, characterized by their velocity and position, both dependent on time. This resulted in cell migration paths, commonly termed \"trajectories\" which are modulated as stochastic process. The implementation of chemotactic effects requires knowledge of the concentration and distribution of the appropriate chemical substance in the scenario. A simplistic model assumption allows the calculation of a numerical solution of the resulting diffusion equation. Adding haptotaxis necessitates the simulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The fiber distribution is modeled as a vector field which contains information on both, fiber density and direction. The production of new fibers is based on ordinary differential equations coupled with the migratory behavior of the cells. Filters help smooth the trajectories. Appropriate visualization allows a direct comparison of the simulation results with histomorphology. Matches between computed data and their real counterparts indicate that the development of mathematical models is appropriate to describe and forecast the course of DSR. This makes systems biology a stepping stone to improving biomedical research.","1598":"In the present study, a semi-automatic segmentation and classification algorithm is proposed for the analysis of histological and cytological images. In view of the fact that histological and cytological images usually exhibit poor contrast and blurred outlines, classical segmentation algorithms often fail to detect relevant structures. A new algorithm for texture segmentation based on signal processing methods in combination with machine learning techniques was therefore developed.","1599":"Virtual tissue can be generated by employing various methods. First steps en route to virtual tissue may encompass the generation of virtual cells. One such approach termed Quaoaring was applied to produce artificial erythrocytes and these were both discocyte and echinocyte in shape. The results were subsequently compared with data gleaned from scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Quaoaring has, however, proved to be unsuccessful in creating convincing objects, particularly those which should be echinocytic in appearance.","1600":"Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) are the main tumor viruses in humans and have been identified in gynecological malignancies, especially carcinomas of the uterine cervix and their precursor lesions. In addition, they are frequently observed in other anogenital tumors such as vulva\/vagina, anal and penis carcinoma. Furthermore, the potential association with head and neck cancer, in particular tonsillar carcinoma, is now well documented. However, there are controversial reports on the detection of HPV in various other tumors; these are summarized in the present report. Data revealed that apart from the heart and the kidney, the virus has been found in all other organs that have been analyzed so far, i.e., prostate, urinary bladder, oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, vagina\/vulva, endometrium, ovary, breast, penis, anus, skin, and lung. Some of the detection rates are remarkable, e.g., colon cancer up to 97%, lung cancer 80%, and breast cancer 74%. They point to geographical differences in the incidence of HPV in different populations, but also highlight the need for validation of the results. HPV is nevertheless an important biomarker in molecular tumor diagnostics. Firstly, it is useful for the differentiation of a secondary squamous cell carcinoma from a metastasis. Secondly, HPV-positive carcinomas not only have a distinct etiology but also a particular morphological phenotype. Overall, they are characterized by different tumor biology, such as, for example, increased sensitivity to radiotherapy.","1601":"The identification of tissue-based biomarkers is a major task for molecular cancer research. As ovarian cancer is a malignancy with a particular poor prognosis, new diagnostic tests are needed for the planning of an individualized therapy. Diagnostic biomarkers are investigated on different biological levels using genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics as a major approach. Protein biomarkers as well as RNA biomarkers can be measured in formalin-fixed tissue using immunohistochemistry as well as new techniques for isolation of nucleic acids. Furthermore, gene expression as well as metabolic signatures can be determined using frozen tissue. In a first evaluation, metabolomics has been used to investigate different types of ovarian tumors. In a systems pathology approach the results from the different biological levels are integrated to a combined signature that reflects the biological behaviour of the tumor.","1602":"For several anatomical localisations of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type (eMZBCL), an association with chronic inflammation caused by microbiological agents (e.g. Helicobacter pylori in the stomach) has been described. In the lung, a link between lymphomagenesis and a defined causative organism is still missing. A comprehensive diversity survey using 16S-rDNA library construction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, sequencing, and phylogenetic tree construction was employed for nine cases each of BALT lymphoma and control lung tissues (normal foetal lung, pneumonitis, carcinoid). This highly sensitive method, hereafter termed SHARP screening allowed for identification of the entire bacterial population in the tissue in a cultivation-independent manner. It was noteworthy that in eight of the nine cases of BALT lymphoma, bacteria of the Alcaligenaceae family (Alcaligenes, Achromobacter, AKIW733), were detected, whereas none of the control cases showed the presence of these clades. 16S-rDNA library construction in combination with RFLP screening and phylogenetic analyses, hereafter described as SHARP screening, is a cultivation-independent tool for analysing the microbial environment in chronic inflammation processes giving rise to extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT-type. Betaproteobacteria of the Alcaligenaceae family may be affiliated with and possibly involved in the lymphomagenesis of BALT lymphomas.","1603":"","1604":"The aim of this study of autopsies performed in our institute was to investigate whether clinical requirements had been met and specific clinical questions answered. With each autopsy report, a questionnaire was sent to the clinic where the patient had died. The clinicians evaluated how often additional diagnoses were made and whether these were clinically relevant. Seventy-two percent of all autopsies resulted in further diagnoses. Clinicians estimated that these could have influenced their clinical management in 36% of cases. Weaknesses in interdisciplinary cooperation were uncovered and solved. The great benefit of the autopsies conducted in our institute was demonstrated. The results emphasise once again the importance of autopsy for quality assurance in clinical medicine. ","1605":"","1606":"Intramedullary high-grade osteosarcomas are aggressive tumors with a high metastatic capacity. The many subtypes and variants of these tumors often make the differential diagnosis difficult. Therefore, a critical review of both radiology and histomorphology is mandatory. Low-grade central osteosarcomas are a completely different tumor group. Due to their strong similarity to benign bone tumors they are frequently misdiagnosed as such. The correct diagnosis followed by radical surgery, however, is essential to reduce the high risk of local recurrences, typically seen for of these lesions. Unlike conventional high grade osteosarcomas, distant metastases are much less frequent than in low grade osteosarcomas.","1607":"A multitude of prognostic and predictive multiparameter algorithms based on the analysis of mRNA have been published in recent years. Many of the algorithms require fresh or fresh frozen tissue as a source of the mRNA. However, practical considerations suggest formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE tissue) to be a more suitable starting material for routine diagnostic applications. Therefore, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics is developing a fully automated method to extract mRNA and DNA from FFPE tissue for use in pathology laboratories. Initially, the method will be used as part of a prognosis assay to predict the likelihood of distant metastasis and death for node-negative breast cancer patients.","1608":"Consistent and complete information is essential for medical decision making. Anatomic pathology as a diagnostic discipline has a central role in the exchange of information between clinical departments throughout the diagnostic process. The IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) has created an integration profile for information systems based on HL7 and DICOM standards. Created by the IHE Anatomic Pathology working group, the integration profile (so-called Technical Framework) ensures the consistent management of data and material in the pathology laboratory information system (PLIS). HL7 and DICOM standards are taken into account. Communication processes both within and outside the institute are modelled using eight actors and 13 transactions. The IHE's Technical Framework covers basic business processes, provision of diagnostic services and includes requesting examinations, as well as image and report management. In particular, a consistent data model for incoming material, containers, cartridges and slides has been developed and approved by the standards committee. ","1609":"As with conventional microscopy, virtual microscopy permits histological tissue sections to be viewed on a computer screen with a free choice of viewing areas and a wide range of magnifications. This, combined with the possibility of linking virtual microscopy to E-Learning courses, make virtual microscopy an ideal tool for teaching and postgraduate training in pathology. Uses of virtual microscopy in pathology teaching include blended learning with the presentation of digital teaching slides in the internet parallel to presentation in the histology lab, extending student access to histology slides beyond the lab. Other uses are student self-learning in the Internet, as well as the presentation of virtual slides in the classroom with or without replacing real microscopes. Successful integration of virtual microscopy depends on its embedding in the virtual classroom and the creation of interactive E-learning content. Applications derived from this include the use of virtual microscopy in video clips, podcasts, SCORM modules and the presentation of virtual microscopy using interactive whiteboards in the classroom.","1610":"Aquaporin1 (AQP1) is a water channel protein which facilitates water flux across cell membranes. AQP1 is found in epithelial and endothelial cells in various tissues. There is increasing evidence that AQP1 is expressed in malignant tumours and that it may play a role in tumour angiogenesis, cell migration and metastasis. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of AQP1 in a cohort of 203 invasive breast carcinomas with long-term follow up. AQP1 expression was detected in 11 cases (5.4%), and showed a significant correlation with high tumour grade, medullary-like histology, \"triple-negativity\", as well a cytokeratin 14 and actin expression. In univariate analysis, AQP1 was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that AQP1 expression has an independent predictive value for outcome if stratified by age, tumour size, lymph node status, histological grade and ER status. AQP1 expression in invasive breast carcinomas is associated with a basal-like phenotype and poor prognosis.","1611":"Molecular-pathologic tumor entities are characterized by a unique combination of morphological, genetic, molecular and clinical features. Increased molecular subtyping and development of diagnostics towards molecular-pathologic entities can be expected for frequent solid cancer types in the future. Initial steps towards this development are discussed for the subtypes of serrated adenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma and micropapillary carcinoma of colorectal cancer. Based on current knowledge, medullary carcinoma of the colon is definitely a molecular-pathologic entity. A high-risk-subtype and a low-risk-subtype - but not the whole group - of colorectal serrated adenocarcinomas also fulfill the criteria of a molecular-pathologic entity. In contrast, micropapillary carcinoma shows a distinct infiltrative pattern, which can occur as part of colorectal cancer, but which is not a molecular-pathologic entity in its own right.","1612":"","1613":"There are several areas of application for virtual microscopy in pathology. After broad use in education and research, we are now seeing its initial application in health care. We can predict that, on the basis of experience gained in digital radiology and early experience in pathology, VM will be established as routine. However, its introduction will follow a different course to that taken in digital radiology, which required that the computer be accepted as a \"necessary evil\" to record and display computer tomograms. Virtual microscopy needs to ensure that it supports the pathologist significantly in terms of access to archives, quantification of markers, display of biopsy stacks, cooperation with colleagues, etc. Consequently, the question of \"When will virtual microscopy enter daily pathology practice?\" may not only be answered on the basis of technical features. Of course, it is necessary that scanning speed goes below 1 min\/cm(2) and that it remains financially viable, but more important is an optimal integration of virtual microscopy in daily pathology routine. This process will extend over several decades, as past developments in digital radiology have shown.","1614":"As a measure of quality assurance in mammography screening in Germany, obligatory double reading of histopathological specimens is currently a subject of debate. Concordance rates of more than 6000 cases gathered from several reference centres were evaluated. In accordance with several international studies, overall agreement in single and double readings in German mammography screening was approximately 95%. Concordance rates were even higher for malignancies (99%). Variations are more common in the case of lesions, the biological significance of which remains unclear (flat atypia, lobular neoplasm, papilloma). This is the result of a currently unresolvable methodological rather classification problem, as seen from studies from countries with many years of experience in training and diagnostic test series. Thus, the evidence base is currently insufficient to mandate double reading of slides.","1615":"Lobular and ductal intraepithelial neoplasias reflect proliferations of immunophenotypically variable, biologically and morphologically diverse cells with a potential, not always realized, for progression to carcinoma by breaking through the barriers of the myoepithelial cell layer and basement membrane, ultimately invading the stroma. Starting with the lobular and then the ductal proliferations, this review will address the evolution of our understanding of these lesions; the problems associated with the conventional terminology of ductal hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, and carcinoma in situ; and reasons for and advantages of the intraepithelial neoplasia terminology.","1616":"The tissue bank of the National Centre for Tumour Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg, Germany, was founded in 2005 by the University Hospital of Heidelberg and the German Cancer Research Centre as a section of the NCT. It is a nonprofit organization with a completely evaluated legal and ethical framework and supports the Comprehensive Cancer Centre concept. Its main aim is the acquisition and characterization of fresh-frozen and paraffin-embedded human tissues according to the standards of good scientific practice and the promotion of interdisciplinary tumour research of the comprehensive cancer centre and its cooperating partners. It also offers expert project assistance: a project leader can submit a short proposal, and the tissue collecting\/preparing process will be performed in cooperation with a specialised pathologist and, if applicable, an experienced clinical researcher. The tissue bank is also a central platform for further developing of innovative technologies for tissue handling, e.g. multi-tissue-array and virtual microscopy, with links to digital image analysis and bioinformatics. Thus, the NCT tissue bank represents a model for innovative biobanking and for institutions with active interdisciplinary cancer research.","1617":"The question is raised whether the new theories about initiation and progression of urothelial carcinoma gained by molecular techniques show effects on the classification and histopathological diagnosis. As fundamental new concepts are considered: two pathways of tumor progression, clonality of synchronous and metachronous tumors, tumor-analogous molecular findings in flat lesions, and stromal invasion as dominant principle of molecular tumor classification.The dual pathogenesis of molecular pathology is reflected by the WHO 2004 classification by the differentiation into low and high grade malignancy, but diluted by the use of PUNLMP (papillary urothelial neoplasia of low malignant potential). The new concept of frequent oligoclonality should induce investigations about the mechanism of propagation of these migrating or metastasizing cells and whether they possess stem cell characteristics. The role of flat urothelial lesions must be revised from a molecular pathological view point, but the histological diagnosis does not gain profit till now. The expression signatures of stromal invasive tumors compared with non-invasive ones points to the major importance of an exact histopathological diagnosis in this area.","1618":"The diagnosis of giant cell-rich lesions of bone is often problematic even for the experienced pathologist. The diagnostic key lies in multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and a mononuclear stroma. From the histological picture alone it is often difficult to distinguish between individual entities such as conventional giant-cell tumor of bone, non-ossifying fibroma, giant-cell tumor in hyperparathyroidism or an aneurysmal bone cyst. Furthermore, these lesions can be confused with malignant bone tumors such as giant cell-rich osteosarcoma. X-ray is important for a correct diagnosis since some of these tumors show a typical anatomic location, while age of the patient is also an important factor. In most cases diagnosis is made on the basis of intraoperative frozen-section, but even in this setting, due to the poor quality of the material, it is very difficult to make a correct diagnosis of giant cell-rich lesions without X-ray and clinical data.","1619":"Although the spectrum of benign and malignant cartilaginous bone tumors is extremely wide, a distinct diagnosis, even from small biopsy specimens, is almost always possible if radiological findings, age, clinical data, and localization within the skeleton as well as within the bone are considered. With limitations, this also holds true for distinguishing enchondromas from low-grade chondrosarcomas; however, extensive experience in multidisciplinary bone tumor diagnosis is required. In single cases, immunohistochemical findings may be helpful in the differential diagnosis if they are integrated into the context of all other findings. Because of treatment-related or prognosis-related consequences, collaboration with a reference center is recommended.","1620":"Molecular biological methods have confirmed the pathogenetic role of enteroviruses, primarily coxsackieviruses of group B (CVB), in the induction and maintenance of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. More recently, adenoviruses, various herpes viruses, and increasingly parvovirus B19 (B19) have been identified as potential cardiotropic agents. While cardiac myocytes are target cells for enterovirus and adenovirus infections with virus-induced cytolysis, B19-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy is characterized by infection of intracardiac endothelial cells of small arterioles and veins, which may be associated with endothelial dysfunction, impairment of myocardial microcirculation, penetration of inflammatory cells, and secondary myocyte necrosis. Recent observations showed that B19 is involved in intracellular calcium regulation by the viral phospholipase. B19-induced caspase activation can lead to proinflammatory\/proapoptotic processes through dysregulation of STAT signaling. These cellular interactions may contribute to mechanisms by which B19 establishes persistent infection in endothelial cells and play a critical role in viral pathogenesis of inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","1621":"","1622":"The Hodgkin cell line U-HO1 was established from a malignant pleural effusion of a 23-yr-old male patient during the end stage of refractory nodular sclerosing classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Since its establishment in 2005, U-HO1 has maintained stable characteristics in vitro and has a doubling time of about 4 days under standard culture conditions. U-HO1 forms typical Reed\/Sternberg cells in suspension, is EBV negative, lacks HLA-ABC- but expresses HLA-D- proteins\/CD74 and surface exposes CD15 together with CD30 in the absence of CD19 and CD20. Karyotype analysis of U-HO1 revealed a hyperdiploid karyotype with multiple clonal aberrations. Most significant is an elongated chromosome 2, der(2)t(2;10)(q35;q16.1)add(2)(p13). CGH analysis revealed the following imbalances: ish cgh dim(1)(p13p31)(p12q21), enh(2)(p13p23), dim(4)(q31.3qter), enh(6)(q22q27), enh(12), enh(18),enh(20)(q13.1pter). FISH analysis showed about six-fold amplification of REL and BCL-11A, thus, U-HO1 is prototypical for cHL in every aspect tested so far. Compared to other HL cell lines, U-HO1 proved far less genetically aberrant suggesting that U-HO1's imbalances suffice to cause the full-blown phenotype of primary refractory cHL.","1623":"About 1-2% of all colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) arise from a background of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease, and around 15% of patients with IBD die from colorectal cancer. Intraepithelial neoplasia\/dysplasia in the setting of IBD is considered a precancerous lesion by definition. Intraepithelial neoplasia may present itself either as a flat or polypoid mucosal lesion and is referred to as a dysplasia-associated lesion or mass (DALM) in the latter case. The therapeutic consequence of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia\/dysplasia and\/or DALM is proctocolectomy in most centers because of the high risk of synchronous or metachronous CRC. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis-related intraepithelial neoplasia and its distinction from regenerative changes and sporadic adenomas (ALMs) occurring in UC is still one of the greatest challenges in gastrointestinal pathology. Intra- and interobserver variability for the distinction between low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and regenerative lesions tends to be quite high. This is partly due to the difficult histomorphology and partly due to the relative rareness of this diagnosis (approximately 10% of patients with IBD).","1624":"The fourth edition of the WHO classification of tumours of the CNS was published in 2007. Six new entities were codified: angiocentric glioma (AG); papillary glioneuronal tumour (PGNT); rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour of the fourth ventricle (RGNT); papillary tumour of the pineal region (PTPR); spindle cell oncocytoma of the adenohypophysis (SCO); and pituicytoma. Furthermore, six histological variants of well-known brain tumours have been added, partially because they show different biological behaviour and\/or prognosis: pilomyxoid astrocytoma; atypical choroid plexus papilloma; medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity; anaplastic medulloblastoma; extraventricular neurocytoma; non-specific variant of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNT). The new entities and variants are discussed in this review. Moreover, the typing und grading of common-type diffuse gliomas, as well as the WHO grading system, are critically reviewed, particularly with regard to the prognostically important differential diagnosis of diffuse astrocytomas und oligodendrogliomas.","1625":"Nowaday, loosening of orthopaedic implants implies important medical and socioeconomic problems. Implant loosening is caused by implant infections as well as aseptic loosening, due to particle disease and mechanical alterations. Clinically we divide the implant infection into early and late infections. Morphologically it is possible to reliably detect the infection by quantification of neutrophil granulocytes. Additionally molecular methods are suitable to detect micro-organisms which are responsible for the prosthetic joint infection including their resistance to antibiotics. Particle disease may be reproducibly classified by the detection of different types of wear particles, particularly polyethylene, metal, ceramic and cement. The aetiology of the indeterminate type of the periprosthetic membrane is obscure, but may be associated with osteopathies. This classification of the periprosthetic membrane morphology provides clinically significant information concerning clinical management of implant loosening.","1626":null,"1627":"Endothelial cells (EC) are crucially involved in allograft rejection. They are prime targets of alloreactivity but also key players in the recruitment and extravasation of immune cells. These mechanisms also become clear in allograft biopsies with antibody-mediated complement deposition on EC and associated intracapillary accumulation of immune cells. HLA molecules are the most prominent targets of alloantibodies in AB0 compatible transplantation. Clinically relevant antibodies against other antigens such as MICA (MHC class I-related chain A) or the angiotensin II Type-1 receptor could also be convincingly demonstrated. The lack of generally available diagnostic tests for such non-HLA antibodies hampers their introduction into clinical practice. Alloantibodies undoubtedly cause allograft rejection. However, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying graft dysfunction in antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is still fragmentary. Activation of EC by anti-endothelial cell antibodies was demonstrated in several experimental systems. Recent animal studies employing immune cell deficient transplant recipients or in-vitro assays, however, failed to demonstrate an immediate response of EC upon antibody binding and complement activation. It might therefore be considered that direct antibody- or complement-mediated EC damage is not necessarily the leading event in acute AMR. Antibody- and\/or complement-induced recruitment of immune cells might rather be of crucial importance at least in the early phases of AMR.","1628":"Genomics and proteomics have evolved towards systems biology. The general goal here is the construction of complex, functional models of biological systems on the basis of molecular networks. Such models enable improved quality in interpretation and evaluation of quantitative measurements and afford a substantially deeper functional understanding. Systems pathology differs from systems biology by attaching the same importance to spatial modelling of tissue alterations as to gene regulatory modelling. In this way, systems pathology is able to deploy disease models for improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In the present work a generic process for systems pathology is created, integrating gene regulatory and morphological models towards molecular disease models. For this purpose, fluorescent virtual microscopy will be essential as it delivers morphological and molecular tissue data with high spatial resolution and high throughput. Using epidermal differentiation as an example, it is shown how - using virtual microscopy - the spatiotemporal expression of biomarkers can be modelled by reconstructing protein networks from fluorescent tissue sections.","1629":"","1630":"","1631":"New findings have been made in recent years on the various forms of the hepatitis virus in terms of disease course, its etiopathogenetic link with comorbidities and the definition of new forms in Central Europe. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced hepatitis may occur in the so-called sero-negative group of hepatitis and direct demonstration of the viral genome in paraffin liver tissues is required to confirm the diagnosis. Since diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis in daily practice may be difficult, a scoring system with simplified criteria has recently been developed.","1632":"The glycosphingolipids globotrihexosylceramide (Gb3, CD77) and isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) are isomers differing only in one glycosidic bond and have been implicated in several processes of the innate and adaptive immune system. 1) To verify the function of Gb3 in the pathogenesis of hemolytic-uremic syndrome as the cellular receptor responsible for cytotoxicity caused by verotoxin (VT) elaborated by Shigella and certain strains of E.coli. 2) To investigate in vivo the previously implicated function of iGb3 as the endogenous lipid ligand responsible for positive selection of invariant natural killer T-cells (iNKT), which have an essential regulatory function in infection, tumor rejection and tolerance. Generation of mice deficient in Gb3 and iGb3 synthesizing enzymes and VT injection into Gb3-deficient mice. Analysis of iNKT cell development and function by flow cytometry and by administration of the exogenous agonist alpha-galactosylceramide in iGb3-deficient mice. For 1) Gb3-deficient mice were insensitive to otherwise lethal doses of VT, and 2) iGb3-deficient mice showed normal numbers of iNKT cells. Furthermore the function of iNKT cells evolving in iGb3-deficient mice was unaffected. 1) Gb3 is the cellular receptor mediating verotoxin cytotoxicity in haemolytic-uremic syndrome. 2) In contrast to previous indirect implications, iGb3 cannot be regarded as an endogenous ligand responsible for the positive selection of iNKT cells. ","1633":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in Germany; there are more than 70,000 new cases annually. It is most commonly a disease of the elderly, and its relative and absolute frequency has risen during the last decades. CRC remains a major clinical and health economy challenge. Progress has been made in patient management and CRC treatment. Screening colonoscopy was introduced in Germany in 2002, and five new therapeutic agents have been approved since 2001, i.e. capecitabine, oxaliplatin, cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab; guidelines have been published, and 48 interdisciplinary CRC centres have been certified in Germany in compliance with DIN EN ISO 9001:2000. Despite these advancements, targeted treatment of CRC is still in its infancy. Until 2007, no predictive biomarkers were used to tailor the adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy of CRC. KRAS genotyping was recently introduced as predictive biomarker, since only tumors carrying a wildtype were found to respond to treatment with panitumumab. Among the tumors with KRAS wildtype, only 40-53% (equivalent to 20-30% of all CRC patients) will benefit from treatment, and the remainder are still enrolled for \"non-targeted\" treatment. Thus there is still a great need for predictive biomarkers that are able to tailor patient treatment at different stages of the disease.","1634":"We have recently characterized ITIH5 as a new extracellular matrix protein that exhibits clear expression loss in a variety of human tumour entities, including breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to decipher the molecular cause of ITIH5 expression loss in breast cancer and to learn more about the possible role of this molecule in cancer diseases. ITIH5 protein expression was found to be strongly reduced in 42% of invasive breast carcinomas-interestingly, with significant association with poor patient outcome. ITIH5 promoter methylation was frequently detected in breast cell lines and in primary carcinomas (40%), and it was functionally correlated with loss of ITIH5 mRNA expression. Moreover, ITIH5 promoter methylation was also significantly associated with poor clinical patient outcome and also with the occurrence of lymph node and distant metastases. In conclusion, we propose that ITIH5 may represent a novel metastasis repressor in human breast cancer. Both ITIH5 protein expression and ITIH5 promoter methylation may serve as prognostic biomarkers, thereby helping improve clinical patient outcome.","1635":"High quality human biological samples (e.g. blood, tissue or DNA) with associated, well documented clinical and research data are key resources for advancement of life sciences, biotechnology, clinical medicine, drug development and also molecular pathology. Millions of samples of diseased tissues have been collected in the context of routine histopathological diagnosis and are stored in the archives of hospitals and institutes of pathology. A concerted effort is necessary to overcome the current fragmentation of the European biobanking community in order to tap the full research potential of existing biobanks. A pan-European research infrastructure for biobanking and biomolecular resources (BBMRI) is currently in its planning phase. The mission is to link and provide access to local biobanks of different formats, including tissue collections, harmonize standards, establish operational procedures which properly consider ethical, legal, societal aspects, and to secure sustainable funding. Pathology plays a key role in development and administration of tissue banks and is, thus, a major partner for collaboration, expertise and construction of this pan-European research infrastructure.","1636":"Accurate classification of haematological malignancies is a prerequisite for their correct diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Clear classification of lymphomas is often hindered by the limited number of available cell surface protein markers that are suitable for immunophenotyping. A systematic and quantitative analysis of cell surface proteins is thus required to identify new protein markers on lymphoma subtypes in an unbiased and discovery-driven approach. Nine Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin B cell lines of diffuse large cell type and mediastinal type were investigated by cell surface capture (CSC) technology, a mass spectrometry-based method to identify cell surface glycoproteins. Selected proteins are verified by antibody-based methods, including flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry on cell line arrays. A total of 747 predicted transmembrane proteins were identified from all cell lines, including 142 CD (cluster of differentiation) annotated proteins. A group of differentially expressed cell surface glycoproteins between Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin B cell lines was revealed via quantitative CSC technology. In addition to classical and expected CD molecules such as CD20 and CD30, less frequently expressed molecules such as CD2 on Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell lines were identified by CSC and verified by immunohistochemistry in cell lines and primary lymphoma tissue. A panel of CSC-identified differentiation glycoprotein candidates is currently under investigation on tissue microarrays (TMAs) from patient samples. ","1637":"The prognosis of the generally benign meningiomas is mainly an issue of the likelihood of recurrence, which increases with WHO grade (7-20% in WHO grade I, 29-40% in WHO grade II, and 50-78% in WHO grade III meningiomas). Among clinical parameters the most important prognostic factor is the completeness of neurosurgical tumor resection. Among histopathological prognostic parameters the mitotic activity is the most important one. As the cutoffs of the mitotic index (MI) are defined for each grade by the WHO classification of brain tumors and because the MI can be applied as the sole grading criterion, the reliable and reproducible assessment of the MI is crucial for an appropriate risk stratification. This is provided by immunohistochemical mitosis markers, i.e., phospho-histone H3 (PHH3). The PHH3 method is superior to the conventional mitosis counting method and therefore allows a more reliable risk stratification. The Ki-67 labeling index provides additional prognostic information, especially in prognostically ambiguous meningiomas. Cytogenetically, the deletion of the short arm of one chromosome 1 (1p-) is an unfavorable prognostic parameter and is correlated with a high risk of recurrence. The enzyme reaction for alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) is a fast and efficient screening method, which strongly indicates an intact chromosome 1 in cases with a positive enzyme reaction.","1638":"Meningoencephalitis caused by Acanthamoeba spp . is a rare opportunistic infection, difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat, which causes death in almost all cases. We report the neuropathologic findings of a 16-year-old girl with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with immunosuppression who died of fulminant Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis. Neuropathologic examination revealed multiple supratentorial and infratentorial hemorrhagic necrotizing lesions with encephalitis and vasculitis with mixed inflammatory infiltrates, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls, and local leptomeningitis. Acanthamoeba in the lesions may be misinterpreted as macrophages. Taking them into differential diagnostic consideration, cytological differences should be detected, and relevant additional stains for reliable differentiation of these cells can be performed. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis in a patient with SLE in Germany.","1639":"Colorectal cancer has the second highest mortality of all cancers in Germany. In spite of advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment, efficient new therapies need to be developed. In recent years, advances have been achieved by novel targeted therapies that are specifically directed against altered signaling pathways of malignant cells. Colorectal cancers represent a heterogeneous tumor entity, and response to targeted therapies varies individually. About 15% of colorectal carcinomas are characterized by a deficient DNA mismatch repair system and microsatellite instability (MSI). These MSI cancers apparently have a decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy and frequently show evidence of a pronounced anti-tumoral immune response of the host. This immune response is likely to be mediated by a high number of tumor-specific antigens generated during MSI tumorigenesis. Interventions specifically targeting these antigens may be the basis for novel therapeutic strategies in MSI colorectal cancer and will be evaluated in clinical trials.","1640":null,"1641":"Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is a cell surface immunoglobulin expressed in breast cancer (BC) and is assumed to be implicated in tumourigenesis and tumour progression. The importance of the adhesion molecule ALCAM for the response to taxane-free adjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Tissue specimens from 162 primary breast cancer patients were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and Western blots (WB) were performed using monoclonal antibody against ALCAM. Relative protein amounts in WB bands were determined densitometrically. ALCAM mRNA expression was evaluated by microarray analysis (Affymetrix). In the normal breast ALCAM is expressed in luminal and basal epithelial cells. In BC samples, WB analysis showed a significant positive correlation of ALCAM levels with estrogen receptor status (p=0.04). For patients who received a taxane-free chemotherapy, a high ALCAM expression was predictive for a good response to chemotherapy. Median mRNA expression of ALCAM was 4.5-fold higher in patients alive at the time of follow-up compared to those who died of breast cancer. Higher ALCAM expression showed a positive correlation with estrogen receptor status and is a useful predictive marker for the response to taxane-free chemotherapy. ","1642":"","1643":"In 2005\/2006 the German National Mammography Screening Program was initiated and has now become established. The objective is to reduce breast cancer mortality and the early diagnosis and therapy of small cancers. The program follows the European guidelines and is controlled by over 30 parameters of quality. All trained members of the team document each step of the screening chain electronically. Histological assessment (HA) is recommended in up to 2% of examinations, 90% of HAs are performed by core needle biopsy (CNB) or by stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (VABB). Open diagnostic biopsies are performed in &lt;10% of all HAs and therapy is successful in some of the B3 lesions. Mammograms are interpreted by two independent readers. Recommendations of the regular interdisciplinary conferences, preoperative and postoperative, follow the European guidelines. About 45% of all breast cancers detected by screening are in-situ or less than 10 mm in size. The 17% alterations diagnosed by needle biopsy are B3 or B4 lesions and impose high demands on the pathologists and the interdisciplinary team. Due to the many early and discrete lesions counterchecking of representative biopsies is crucial. Problems may be caused by sampling error or partial volume effects. Interdisciplinary conferences and knowledge of the limitations of each discipline and method are needed to optimize diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.","1644":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of basal and myoepithelial phenotype in breast carcinomas (BBC and MBC) in the palliative situation. Paraffin-embedded material from 244 primary breast carcinomas of patients with subsequent metastatic disease was stained immunohistochemically for CK 5\/6, CK14, smooth-muscle actin, p63, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. BBC was defined as positive for CK5\/6 and\/or CK14 and MBC as positive for SMA and\/or p63. Clinical and pathological data were available for all patients and follow-up data for 96.3% (range 5 days-151 months). Until the end of the follow-up period 90.2% of patients died and 6.1% are still alive. Of the tumours 28.7% could be classified as BBC and 8.2% as MBC. Kaplan Meier analysis revealed a trend for reduced survival after first diagnosis of metastasis (OASM) for BBC and MBC. Differences in survival were significant for BBC (log-rank =5.0; p=0.025), but not for MBC. CK5\/6+ and CK14+ double positive tumours (n=18; 7.4%) were identified as a subgroup of BBC associated with reduced OASM (log-rank=8,6; p=0.003). This subgroup, but not BBC or MBC was an independent negative prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis including age, typing, tumour size, grading, axillary nodes, HR, Her2\/neu, site of first metastasis and disease-free interval. The association of BBC and MBC with reduced OASM in metastatic breast carcinomas is not independent from established prognostic factors. CK5\/6+ CK14+ double positive tumours may be a subgroup of BBC with particularly unfavourable outcome. ","1645":"The aim of this study was to unravel the role of the transcription factor inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) in human breast carcinogenesis in more detail, especially the impact of ID4 promoter methylation on disease progression. Demethylating treatment of breast cancer cell lines was associated with ID4 reexpression. ID4 promoter methylation was frequently observed in primary breast cancer samples (68.9%, 117\/170). We found a very tight correlation (p&lt;0.001) between ID4 promoter methylation and loss of ID4 mRNA expression in these specimens. For breast tissue as the first tumour entity analyzed in detail, we could show a direct correlation between ID4 promoter methylation and loss of ID4 expression on both the mRNA and protein level. Interestingly, ID4 promoter methylation was a factor for unfavourable recurrence-free survival (p=0.036) and increased the patient's risk for lymph node metastases (p=0.030). Our data suggest that ID4 is a potential tumour suppressor gene in human breast tissues that undergoes epigenetic silencing during carcinogenesis, leading to an increased risk for tumour relapse. Thus, ID4 methylation status could serve as a prognostic biomarker in human breast cancer.","1646":"With the improvement of breast carcinoma screening, pre-malignant cell lesions such as flat epithelial atypia (FEA) are detected more frequently. Several studies have demonstrated that FEA show features of a ductal neoplasia, but is it really a precursor lesion? We have started a comparative genetic analysis of a panel of nine microsatellite markers on six different chromosomal regions to investigate whether FEAs show the same characteristic genetic alterations as ductal carcinomas in situ (DCISs) and invasive carcinoma of the breast. FEAs, DCISs and invasive carcinomas of the same patients were microdissected using PALM micro laser technology. DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN). We have investigated a set of the polymorphic microsatellite markers D7S522, D8S522, NEFL, D10S541 (PTEN), D13S153 (RB1), D16S400, D16S402, D16S422 and D17S855 (BRCA1) using multiplex PCR for the detection of allelic imbalances. Most of the investigated FEAs showed a lower frequency of loss of heterozygosity than associated DCISs or invasive carcinomas. However, we were able to detect the same alterations in FEAs as in DCISs or invasive carcinomas in a number of cases. Notably, the microsatellite marker on 16q showed more prevalent allelic imbalances in FEAs than the other investigated markers. One of the hallmarks in the pathogenesis of a large subgroup of invasive breast carcinomas is the early loss of chromosome arm 16q. In this study, we were able to detect frequent genetic alterations on chromosome 16q in FEAs, associated DCISs and invasive carcinomas. This suggests that FEA is a precursor lesion in the low-grade pathway.","1647":"The introduction of modern chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted therapies has substantially changed the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC). Thus, median survival of stage IV patients was increased from 6 months under best supportive care to over 2 years if all drugs are administered. Also, new combination therapies may cause irresectable liver metastases to shrink to such an extent that they may be resected (downsizing). Patients who were formerly treated with palliative intent may now be cured. However, not all patients benefit from the new compounds. Very recently, new genetic characteristics were identified as potential molecular biomarkers that may predict response to anti-EGFR therapy, a specific targeted therapy; the marker detected is the mutational status of the oncogene k-ras. Only patients with wild-type k-ras-expressing tumors respond to anti-EGFR antibodies. The integration of biomarker analysis into the clinical routine represents an important step toward customized treatment of cancer patients.","1648":"Glial tumours represent the majority of central nervous system tumours. Even though current therapy guidelines do not advocate the routine use of molecular markers for treatment decisions, the identification of prognostic markers and patient subgroups that may especially benefit from novel therapeutic options becomes increasingly important also outside the setting of clinical trials. This review summarizes methods and rationale for the use of the determination of 1p\/19q loss, MGMT promoter methylation and tyrosine kinase receptor expression as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive markers in gliomas.","1649":"The 42-kDa multifunctional cellular protein Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) is expressed in various cancers. It is localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. In particular, YB-1 is localized in the nuclear compartment following cellular stress, such as radiation, drug treatment, hyperthermia, or viral infection. Within the nucleus, YB-1 can act as a transcription factor, and it is involved in the regulation of important cancer-associated genes. For example, YB-1 triggers the expression of Her-2 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in breast cancer. Thus, nuclear YB-1 appears to be a potential target for the inhibition of Her-2- and ERalpha-dependent proliferation signals, particularly with regard to resistance to Her-2-targeting drugs such as trastuzumab. In some cancers, YB-1 may be involved in regulating MDR1\/P-glycoprotein, mediating classical multidrug resistance (MDR). Furthermore, YB-1 is involved in the replication of adenovirus type 5, a commonly used vector in gene therapy. Thus, YB-1 can trigger an \"oncolytic\" effect in YB-1 nuclear positive cancer cells treated with adenoviruses. Besides its impact as a prognostic factor, in the future the diagnostics of cellular YB-1 status may provide the basis for a virotherapy or a gene therapy incorporating adenoviruses.","1650":"The increasing life expectancy will cause an increasing share for neurodegenerative and dementing illnesses in the total cost for health care. New developments such as the discovery of TDP-43 as disease protein have opened new viewpoints on frontotemporal dementias, as well as its relation to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As pathologists and neuropathologists we are committed to contributing to the progress of clinical diagnosis, which often proves difficult, by standardized post-mortem diagnosis. The diagnostic responsibility will increase with the development of new specific therapeutics and knowledge of contraindications such as the use of neuroleptics in patients suffering from Lewy body dementia. The Reference Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases of the German Society of Neuropathology and Neuroanatomy and the German Brain Bank (Brain-Net) at the Institute for Neuropathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, are available for diagnosis in difficult or complex cases.","1651":"Interstitial lung diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of about 200 entities. In the classification of these diseases, diffuse parenchymal lung diseases with known cause, granulomatous diseases, and other specific interstitial lung diseases are separated from the important group of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, which are classified according to the 2002 ATS\/ERS consensus classification. Concerning the histological pattern, this classification differentiates between \"usual interstitial pneumonia\" (UIP), \"nonspecific interstitial pneumonia\" (NSIP), \"organising pneumonia\" (COP), \"diffuse alveolar damage\" (DAD), \"respiratory bronchiolitis\" (RB), \"desquamative interstitial pneumonia\" (DIP), \"lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia\" (LIP) and \"unclassifiable interstitial pneumonias\". A key message of this classification is that the pathologist will give the diagnosis of a histological pattern, whereas the final clinicopathologic diagnosis can be made only by the clinical pulmonologist after careful correlation with the clinical and radiologic features, which is essential in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases.","1652":"","1653":"Intratumor genetic heterogeneity, a well-known characteristic of numerous cancers, often confounds a precise diagnosis and leads to therapy resistance. This study deals with such chromosomal variability, which may be due to an inherent genetic instability affecting heterogeneity and clonal effects. Subpopulations of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 were isolated according to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by FACS. Whole genome profiling (CGH; mapping arrays) and determination of egfr gene amplification (fluorescence in situ hybridisation, FISH; qPCR) were done directly after sorting or after several passages of cell culture. Subpopulations differed in the amplification of the egfr-locus 7p11-14 showing egfr gene amplification rates of up to 60-fold in high-level expressing populations and less than 2-fold in low-level expressing populations. However, after several passages the original low-level cells showed a new amplification of the egfr gene, which was as heterogeneous as the original amplification detected in MDA-MB-468. Additional, spontaneously expressed fragile sites could be shown in FISH analyses which may affect cell culture heterogeneity. Understanding the precise chromosomal process would clarify mechanisms in vivo and improve both diagnosis and therapy of corresponding cancers.","1654":"The von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor is a multifunctional protein. VHL mutations are common in sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Different mutation types may specifically alter pVHL functions, which have significant impact on gene expression and, consequently, on the disease outcome. The aim of this study was to identify gene expression signatures that correlate with specific VHL gene mutation types in RCC. Total RNA and genomic DNA were extracted from 94 frozen clear cell (ccRCC) and 21 papillary RCC (pRCC) specimens from the tumor biobank of Zurich University Hospital. Transcriptome analysis was performed using Affymetrix HG U133A gene chips. All ccRCC tumors were subjected to VHL gene mutation analysis. By applying significance analysis of microarrays genes were identified, which were differentially regulated among the tumor subgroups. Hierarchical clustering based on the expression profile of the most differentially regulated genes resulted in a significant stratification between the two RCC populations. A total of 186 differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of ccRCC with VHL loss-of-function mutations and ccRCC with no gene alterations. The results clearly argue for a significant influence of VHL mutations on gene expression profiles in RCC. ","1655":"The introduction of targeted therapy in metastatic renal cancer patients provides a whole array of individual therapeutic options. The basis for this treatment is the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, resulting in high expression of pro-angiogenic growth factors, e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). This provides the rationale for targeting these pathways in clear cell renal cell carcinomas by small molecule inhibitors. This article gives a review on clinical trials with sunitinib, sorafenib, and temsirolimus in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and shows how promising treatments can emerge from an understanding of the molecular genetics and signaling pathways of tumors. However, a predictive marker, e.g. specific mutations associated with drug-resistant or responsive tumors, has not yet been identified and is paramount for the future.","1656":"Germ line inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene causes von Hippel-Lindau hereditary cancer syndrome, and somatic mutations of this gene have been linked to the development of sporadic hemangioblastomas and clear cell renal carcinomas. The protein encoded by VHL, pVHL, has no known enzymatic activities but interacts with various partner proteins. In this review, various pVHL functions are highlighted. pVHL acts as a multi-purpose adaptor protein that controls different gene expression programs. Through its oxygen-dependent regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha), pVHL plays a central role in the oxygen-sensing pathway. In addition, many HIFalpha-independent functions of pVHL have recently been identified. These include microtubule-based processes, extracellular matrix assembly and suppression of kidney cyst formation. These complex pVHL functions can explain the diverse consequences of pVHL dysregulation in tumor formation and progression.","1657":"Currently histopathological review is not standard practice in clinical studies of ovarian carcinomas. Published retrospective analyses as well as own unpublished observations have indicated that a certain percentage of study patients may have ovarian lesions other than ovarian carcinomas which may be in conflict with study inclusion criteria. In this context, the distinction of ovarian carcinomas from borderline tumors, ovarian metastases, and sex cord tumors has been shown to be a potential pitfall. In cases of incorrect diagnoses, non-beneficial morbidity at unnecessary high cost may occur, in other instances, more adequate therapeutic modalities might be withheld from a patient. At present, the concept of a central histopathology review for patients with ovarian carcinomas is being studied prospectively in a translational research project of the AGO-Ovar termed \"HIstologische STandardisierte Zweitbegutachtung in einem Studienkollektiv fortgeschrittener Ovarialkarzinome, OVAR 11t-HISTO\" (Histological standardized review in a study collective of advanced ovarian cancer; http:\/\/www.mh-hannover.de\/institute\/pathologie\/dgp:Studien).","1658":"Columnar cell lesions (CCL) and lobular neoplasia (LN) are encountered with increasing frequency in breast screening biopsies. CCLs are frequently associated with microcalcifications, whereas LN is an incidental finding in most cases. Flat epithelia atypia (FEA) the atypical variant of CLL, LN and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) are frequently associated lesions. Molecular genetic studies of CCL, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and low grade invasive carcinomas revealed similar chromosomal alterations supporting the assumption that CCLs are neoplastic proliferations. The frequent association of FEA together with well differentiated invasive carcinomas provides further evidence of this concept. There is no internationally accepted classification of CCLs at present. CDH1-gene mutations are the cardinal feature of LN and invasive lobular carcinoma. In immunohistochemically CDH1-positive cases, alternative genetic alterations of the CDH1 pathway can lead to functional loss of CDH1. In our opinion morphologically and immunohistochemically hybrid lesions may represent this group of lobular lesions. Recent follow-up data suggest a higher rate of ipsilateral carcinomas in patients with previously diagnosed LN. It is currently an open question whether FEA and LN are members of a common family of intralobular proliferations, which are non-obligatory precursors of a low nuclear grade breast neoplasia family.","1659":null,"1660":"Tissue specimens taken in pathology for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions have been collected for decades, archived and used for local research projects. Meanwhile there is an increasing need of this material for academic and non-academic biomedical research. Many questions in the field of translational research can only be addressed with a sufficient number of high quality tissue samples especially when combined with comprehensive clinical data. Although biobanks represent an indispensable basis for medical research, this might be in conflict with the rights of patients. Currently there are no specific regulations for biobanks leading to substantial legal uncertainties. However, interpretation of existing regulations by the National Ethics Committee or the Telematic Platform for Medical Research Network are important for ethical and legal solutions. Irrespective of future (national or European) regulations, the informed consent of the patients including a secure data protection concept is a prerequisite for establishment and operation of biobanks.","1661":"Flat epithelial atypia (FEA) of the breast has recently gained attention as a possible precursor lesion of highly differentiated breast cancer. Especially tubular carcinomas, with which FEA shares cytological features, often occur in close proximity to each other. To examine a possible clonal relationship, we analysed mutations of the highly variable region of the mitochondrial genome in a series of tubular carcinomas, associated FEA and normal glands. Multiple sequence alignment showed identical mtDNA mutations in approximately 50% of paired FEA and tumour samples, indicative of a clonal relationship. Our data indicate a possible precursor role of FEA in the development of tubular breast cancer.","1662":"Lack of therapeutic options and poor reproducibility of histopathological subtypes have been the reasons that ovarian carcinomas are currently treated as monolithic entity. Histopathological grading is used to identify those patients who can be spared adjuvant therapy. With slight modifications of the WHO based subtype classification we have shown that subtypes (i.e. serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous) can be reproducibly used to stratify patients according to disease-specific survival. As these pathologically identifiable subtypes have different epidemiologic and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, molecular abnormalities and clinical behaviour, screening and management strategies have to be subtype-specific.","1663":"The synovial membrane is a site where many diseases with different etiologies can become manifest. Tumors and storage diseases are some of the rare conditions, whereas crystal deposition diseases, acute bacterial infections and in particular chronic uncharacteristic synovitis are frequently encountered. The latter present a diagnostic problem, because they can barely be assigned to concrete diagnoses. This report will give an overview of the differential diagnosis of joint diseases and will focus on the so-called synovitis score as a tool for the systematic evaluation of chronic uncharacteristic synovitis, providing a possibility to differentiate between degenerative and rheumatic synovitis with a specificity of 60.5% and a sensitivity of 95.5%.","1664":"","1665":"The nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is a rare urothelial neoplasia which is characterized by relatively bland morphology and early muscle-invasive growth. We report on a 65-year-old male patient with a non-invasive high-grade urothelial lesion (carcinoma in situ and pTa G3). After treatment with BCG an invasive urothelial carcinoma was discovered whereas the carcinoma in situ had disappeared. Examination of the bladder specimen showed a nested-variant urothelial carcinoma. Molecular analyses indicated a de-novo genesis of the invasive urothelial carcinoma.","1666":"Urothelial carcinoma comprise a heterogenous group of diseases with very different clinical outcome: 70%-80% of urothelial carcinoma are genetically stable and associated with a favorable prognosis, while 20%-30% are genetically unstable and have a high progression rate. Therefore, the current WHO Classification (2004) reduces the histologic grade to simply 'low grade' and 'high grade'. In addition to TNM classification and histologic grade, genetic factors such as p53 mutations, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PIC(3)CA) are relevant in a patient's prognosis.","1667":"Germ cell tumors (GCT) comprise a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant tumors. Based on their different biological characteristics and their origin, five types of GCT are classified. Among these, malignant seminomatous and non-seminomatous GCT in males and females are designated as type II GCT. They occur most frequently as malignant testicular GCTs. Many characteristics of type II GCT can be linked to embryonic stem cells. Intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified (IGCNU) is the precursor of type II GCT and derives from undifferentiated germ cells, gonocytes, which persist in the newborn testis and escape the normal differentiation process. It is suggested that Exon-17-activated mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase, c-KIT, occur early in germ cell development and that gonocytes with an activated c-KIT receptor are restricted in their differentiation, thereby escaping normal development. New diagnostic markers for neoplastic germ cells, including OCT3\/4 and AP-2gamma, are specifically detected in IGCNU, seminomas and embryonal carcinomas and are helpful in the differentiation of type II GCT from other malignant tumors.","1668":"Today, more than 80% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCA) by PSA screening do not die from the sequelae of their disease. About 70% present with early, organ-confined cancer and almost half of them are small (&lt;5 cm(3)) without evidence of progression over years (insignificant PCA). It is assumed that screening brings the diagnosis of PCA forward by about 9 years and that in almost one third of these cases immediate radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy would result in overtreatment. Thus, the treatment strategy of \"active surveillance\" with selective but delayed intervention for patients with organ-confined PCA could be an attractive alternative to the known curative therapy options. However, a prerequisite of such a therapeutic approach would be a precise identification of patients at high risk for cancer progression. Careful work-up of prostate core needle biopsies including improved pre-embedding preparation and detailed interpretation are of the utmost importance. A Gleason score &lt; or =6 and tumor in only one or two cores are considered predictive of organ-confined cancer. Pathologists should concentrate on correct Gleason scoring in core needle biopsies and identification of lesions that exclude a patient from active surveillance.","1669":"Feulgen staining represents a staining method to quantitatively document the DNA content of a nucleus. Thus it is an excellent and straightforward method to reflect the irregular increase in DNA content of a malignant cell as a sign of genetic instability. Genetic instability of the tumour cell is the key feature of the 2004 WHO classification of bladder tumours, in which flat and papillary neoplasia are grouped into low- and high-grade lesions. \"High grade\" represents the tumor with genetic instability and consequently a higher likelihood of progression. Concomitant distinct genetic aberrations other than the numeric ones are increasingly identified as discriminators and help group the entities. The current status of genetic investigations, especially those in precancerous lesions, will be outlined in this review in the context of morphology (histology and cytology) as well as clinical situation.","1670":"Plasmacytoid carcinoma is a rare variant of urothelial carcinoma and is characterised by distinct histopathological and clinical characteristics. The incidence varies between 2.7% and 3.1% of all muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. It is an aggressive, high-grade tumor with poor prognosis. Negative E-cadherin expression seems to be important for exact diagnosis. Systemic chemotherapy of plasmacytoid carcinoma could lead to prolonged patient survival.","1671":"By integrating genetic data into the traditional histology and immunohistochemistry-based classification system the revised WHO-classification of malignant tumours (2004) defined additional renal cell carcinoma subtypes, thereby enabling the application of additional diagnostic procedures. Therapy for advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma has also seen significant progress. This report focuses on these developments, pinpoints current obstacles and provides future prospects.","1672":null,"1673":"We report a case of multifocal urothelial carcinoma in situ of the left ureter with early stromal invasion and concomitant in situ lesions in bladder, prostate and seminal vesicle. After complete topographical mapping of the cystoprostatovesiculectomy specimen the unusual manifestation of urothelial carcinoma in situ in a seminal vesicle turned out to be a tumour spread via the ductus ejaculatorius into the seminal vesicle. DNA sequencing of the tumour suppressor gene TP53 of different tumour lesions revealed identical wild-type sequences.","1674":null,"1675":"The first half of the twentieth century was marked by noticeable changes in society, medicine and institutions. The interrelationship between these factors can be demonstrated by clinical mass sources, in particular by patient and autopsy records, which historians have so far neglected. A longitudinal study was made where data, such as gender and age as well as clinical and anatomical-pathological diagnoses were collected, based on 250 autopsy records from 8 selected years between 1914 and 1960. The random samples taken showed clear differences in gender relationship and in age composition and in addition they revealed a significant reduction in mortality caused by inflammation and an increase of chronic diseases, such as tumors or cardiac-circulation ailments. The origin of this development is seen in medical progress as well as in institutional and ideological circumstances, therefore multidimensional reciprocal effects must be thoroughly analyzed.","1676":"Diagnostic lymph node pathology is primarily focused on identification, definition and classification of lymphoid neoplasms. Less attention is paid to reactive lymph node changes as their causes often cannot be elucidated. We outline several particular types of lymph node reactions that allow a delineation of potential causative agents. A thorough understanding of the morphology of reactive lymph node changes can also aid in the differential diagnosis between reactive and neoplastic lymph node changes.","1677":"In the age of personalized medicine, and in addition to typing and grading, breast cancer pathologists are now also involved in determining biomarkers such as steroid hormone receptors and Her-2, which are of the utmost importance in adjuvant therapy. In order to assure quality of these biomarker assays, external proficiency testing has been implemented in Germany. Since 2002 trials have been conducted annually, with up to 180 participating laboratories. More than 85% of all participants achieved good results in clearly negative and positive cases seen in daily practice. If at all, discordant results were observed in the rarer low steroid-hormone receptor expressing tumors and Her-2 borderline cases (2+). Regular participation in interlaboratory testing leads to significantly improved immunohistochemical results, particularly in these problematic cases. Tissue microarrays (TMA) with 20-24 different breast cancer samples including cell lines meant that a huge number of pathologists were challenged with identical samples, providing the prerequisite for comparability. Participation is recommended for pathology departments involved in the service for breast units. The organizational frame work of the trials is described here. The confidence of cooperating disciplines in breast cancer biomarkers assessed by pathologists will be fostered by external proficiency testing as presented here.","1678":"Persistent subcutaneous nodules arise at the injection sites of aluminium hydroxide-absorbed hyposensitization solutions. We present a hitherto unreported phenomenon in aluminium granuloma. Two years after specific immunotherapy, a patient suffered increasingly from urticaria. Besides inflammatory infiltrates surrounding necrotic areas, microscopy of the specimen revealed numerous mast cells surrounding the necrotic tissue areas. The histological phenomenon of increased mast cell populations in aluminium granuloma might reflect the association with urticaria, which is probably more frequent than previously reported.","1679":"","1680":"The group of odontogenic ectomesenchymal tumors consists of odontogenic fibroma (epithelium-rich and epithelium-poor types), odontogenic myxoma, and cementoblastoma. Whereas odontogenic fibromas and cementoblastomas are very rare lesions, odontogenic myxoma is the fourth common odontogenic tumor, preceded only by keratocystic odontogenic tumor, the odontomas, and ameloblastoma. The diagnosis of cementoblastoma rests on its connection to the root of a tooth. The differentiation of odontogenic fibroma and myxoma from other lesions, especially from normal structures such as dental follicles and papillae, may be challenging if the X-ray appearance (localized osteolysis containing a tooth) is not appreciated and subtle histological clues (remainders of inner enamel epithelium at the surface of the lesion, dentin fragments) are not properly recognized. While odontogenic fibromas have almost no tendency for recurrence and are treated by enucleation or local excision, cementoblastomas and especially odontogenic myxomas have a high percentage of recurrence if intralesional procedures are applied. Hence, complete resection with free margins is recommended--at least for larger odontogenic myxomas and, especially, lesions in the maxilla--to prevent further extension to the orbita or base of the skull.","1681":"Malignant odontogenic tumors are extremely rare. As with benign odontogenic tumors, malignant epithelial odontogenic tumors or odontogenic carcinomas are distinguished from the even rarer mesenchymal ones, the odontogenic sarcomas. The existence of odontogenic carcinosarcomas is not yet acknowledged by the World Health Organization. Odontogenic carcinomas comprise ameloblastic carcinoma (AmCa), primary intraosseous carcinoma (PIOC), clear cell odontogenic carcinoma, odontogenic ghost cell carcinoma (OGCC), and the special case of metastasizing ameloblastoma. Odontogenic sarcomas consist of ameloblastic fibrosarcoma and ameloblastic fibrodentinosarcoma and fibroodontosarcoma. Whereas metastasizing ameloblastoma can be diagnosed only after having metastasized, all other malignant odontogenic tumors present with atypia, increased cellularity and mitoses, and invasion. Odontogenic sarcomas are regarded as low-grade tumors that rarely metastasize. Odontogenic carcinomas, however, especially AmCa, OGCC, and PIOC, are more aggressive, with a 5-year survival rate of about 70% for AmCa and OGCC and a 3-year survival rate of about 37% for PIOC. Radical surgery, eventually in combination with radiotherapy, is the treatment of choice.","1682":"We present the case of a 38-year-old woman with a thymus cyst with an incidental tiny adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas of the thymus or in thymus cysts have seldom been reported. These cases were overt invasive carcinomas. Our case is the first report on an incipient adenocarcinoma in a thymus cyst. It demonstrates the importance of thorough histological examination of cystic changes in the thymus, not only for the diagnostic classification of the lesion but also to ensure that a possible malignant change is not overlooked.","1683":"The group of benign epithelial odontogenic tumors consists of the four member types of the ameloblastoma family (solid\/multicystic, extraosseous\/peripheral, desmoplastic, unicystic), squamous odontogenic tumors, calcifying odontogenic tumors, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, and keratocystic odontogenic tumors, the former \"keratocysts\" that were recently reclassified by the World Health Organization and are now regarded as tumors. The latter are by far the most frequent tumors in this group, followed by solid\/multicystic ameloblastoma. Although the etiology of these lesions is still unknown, a close relationship to normal tooth development is obvious, which is partially imitated by some tumors. Despite some similarities to each other, at least in part, the biological behavior of these lesions is quite different, as are treatment modalities. The diagnosis is essentially based on localization (intraosseous vs. extraosseous\/peripheral) and histology, whereupon the correlation of histological findings with radiographic morphology may be of additional diagnostic value. Because of the range of variation, immunohistochemical investigations are not helpful in diagnosing a particular case.","1684":"Contrary to chromosomal aberrations, which can be recognized by cytogenetic procedures alone, monogenic inherited diseases are determined exclusively by evidence from anatomical-pathological investigations. We present a computer-assisted optical system providing not only efficient dissections of embryos, but also diagnosis of congenital defects, such as congenital heart deformities, neural tube defects and skeletal malformations. A stereomicroscope with an integrated camera as well as two cold light sources creates a three-dimensional image of the human embryo (size: e.g., 2.5 mm=23.-25.d), hence facilitating handling of the autopsy. Scenes of interest are photodocumented by a multifocusing camera. Its technique is based on serial pictures of predefined levels of the embryo, consecutively adding up to one photograph with minimized areas out of focus. The sequences, the rapid as well as exact calibration of the screened objects and digital archiving of the obtained photographs allow efficient diagnostic procedures. As the depth of field is broadened, the computer-assisted workplace improves the diagnosis as well as documentation, providing a base for genetic counseling.","1685":"Benign \"mixed\"odontogenic tumors consist of an epithelial and ectomesenchymal tumor component, distinguishing them from pure epithelial and pure ectomesenchymal odontogenic tumors. In addition, they may have the ability to produce dentin, enamel or cementum. Therefore, they can sometimes already be differentiated radiologically from epithelial odontogenic tumors. Some of the mixed odontogenic lesions are regarded as true tumors (ameloblastic fibroma, odontoameloblastoma, dentinogenic ghost cell tumor), while others are assumed to represent hamartomatous lesions (complex and compound odontoma, probably also ameloblastic fibrodentinoma and ameloblastic fibroodontoma). Preceded by keratocystic odontogenic tumor, complex and compound odontomas are the second most common odontogenic tumors, while other members of the \"mixed\" odontogenic tumor group are far less frequently diagnosed. Odontoameloblastoma and dentinogenic ghost cell tumors are locally aggressive lesions that require total resection. All other lesions of this group are treated by local excision. Since ameloblastic fibrosarcoma may evolve from ameloblastic fibroma, patients with ameloblastic fibroma should remain in long-term follow-up.","1686":"","1687":"Odontogenic cysts form a group of diseases whose origin is linked to the persistence of epithelium resulting from the complex embryonic development of the teeth and jaws within the connective tissue. Inflammatory reactions of the surrounding area of the persisting odontogenic epithelium accompany epithelium proliferation, which leads to the development of a gradually expanding cavity that supersedes the surrounding structure. The correlation between activity of the inflammatory reaction and the development of the epithelial proliferation results in a relatively broad variation of histological features of the cyst wall. Since classification of cyst forms depends on their topographical features, clinical information on the classification of variations is urgently needed. For the classification of their clinical course of development and, in particular, in order to differentiate them from cystic odontogenic tumors of the jaw region, a histological examination of cyst wall tissue is necessary, all the more so since the development of a carcinoma deriving from the odontogenic epithelium has only been described in very few cases.","1688":"Solitary bone cyst of the pelvis is a rare lesion. The diagnosis is relatively simple providing sufficient material is accumulated during biopsy or surgery. Calcifying forms often cause difficulties in terms of differential diagnosis. Radiographic imaging can be complex when examining large lesions of the pelvis. Biopsy is the method of choice for definitive diagnosis, which should be verified against material gathered surgically or during curettage. Bone tumors of the pelvis have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of the lesion. Large cystic lesions of the pelvis in particular are to be reviewed pathohistologically to avoid false diagnosis. The consequences for the patient in terms of quality of life and life expectancy can be serious. The need for interdisciplinary cooperation is greater than ever to ensure correct diagnosis and therapy of bone lesions.","1689":"","1690":"During embryonic development the urachus connects the bladder with the umbilical cord. The urachus obliterates postnatally. Incomplete obliterations result in urachal cysts which, in the case of a connection to the bladder, are termed urachal diverticula. Urachal tumors are rare. We report on the case of a 46-year-old female patient with a 13-year history of recurrent bladder infections and mucusuria caused by an urachal diverticulum. After surgical resection histologic examination showed a mucus producing, intestinally differentiated adenoma within the diverticulum. This finding explains both the recurrent infections and the 10-year history of mucusuria.","1691":"Differential diagnosis of infantile pulmonary cysts comprises congenital cystic lesions (including foregut cysts) and pneumatoceles (i.e., pulmonary cysts of acquired, inflammatory or traumatic origin). We report the resection of a subpleural air-filled lung cyst of 4 cm in a former preterm (33rd week of pregnancy) at the age of 8 months that was first diagnosed 7 days postnatally by chest X-ray. Pneumatocele was diagnosed pathomorphologically. In children, most pneumatoceles are caused by trauma or pneumonia. In the case described, disruption of subpleural alveolar walls due to high pressure ventilation is the likely cause. Differential diagnoses are discussed. ","1692":"","1693":"Splenic vascular disturbances mainly affect the red pulp and can involve the venous or arterial blood flow. The venous blood flow may be impaired by congestion and morphologically shows dilated splenic sinuses. Disturbances of the arterial blood flow may occur in connection with anomalies of the erythrocyte membrane or in immune haemolysis and usually are characterized by narrow splenic sinuses. Infarction of the spleen is usually caused by arterial embolism.","1694":"From a pathologic-anatomic perspective, the splenic parenchyma is divided into red and white pulp, which react to a certain extent independently from one another in the context of systemic and local processes. While the red pulp serves to filter blood, the white pulp, together with the perifollicular marginal zone, organizes immune reactions. In the marginal zone, innate and acquired immune responses are integrated. The vast majority of splenectomies serve therapeutic purposes in the context of already known disease. Therefore, only about 10% of splenectomy specimens are diagnostic challenges, including the diagnosis of haematological diseases, splenomegaly or splenic tumors. Differential diagnosis considerations are discussed based on the clinical presentation.","1695":"Inflammatory reactions of the spleen occur in the context of two pathophysiological settings. First, lymphoid hyperplasia of the spleen can be the result of a principally physiological production of immune effector cells e.g. due to systemic viral infections, autoimmune diseases and acquired or inherited immunodeficiencies. Second, the spleen itself may be the target of a pathological inflammatory reaction; this setting is exemplified by abscess formation due to septicopyemic spread of bacteria and by granulomatous inflammations, e.g. due to tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. Differential diagnostic considerations have to include splenic inflammatory pseudotumors, mycobacterial spindle cell tumors and lymphomas with granulomatous or histiocyte-rich reactive changes.","1696":"Splenic marginal zone B cell lymphomas (SMZBCL) are rare, organotypic, lymphoid neoplasms with distinct clinicopathological features. At initial presentation, the spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood are usually involved, while generalized lymphadenopathy is only rarely observed. Molecularly, somatic hypermutation of IgVH genes can be detected in roughly half of the cases, and deletions in 7q are present in 45% of tumors. Approximately 10%-15% of SMZBCL do occur in the setting of chronic hepatitis C. This association underlines the importance of antigenic stimulation in the proliferation of the tumor cells in HCV-associated SMBCL, if not also in their classical counterparts. More recently, gene profiling studies using cDNA microarrays revealed a homogeneous expression profile in SMZBCL, thus further confirming the notion of a distinct tumor entity. The clinical course is indolent in the majority of cases; however, some patients follow a more aggressive clinical course, usually associated with some particular molecular features in these tumors, such as unmutated IgVH genes and 7q deletions.","1697":"Vascular proliferations of the spleen reflect the variability of vascular structures occurring in the normal spleen. Besides haemangiomas, there is a spleen-specific vascular neoplasm, littoral cell angioma, that often occurs as a paraneoplastic lesion and thus may require the differential diagnostic delineation of metastases to the spleen in patients with known neoplasms. The most common malignant vascular tumours of the spleen are angiosarcomas. A recently described vascular lesion of unknown pathogenesis, sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) of the spleen, usually is an incidental finding detected in the course of imaging studies.","1698":"The spleen is commonly affected by malignant lymphomas and the macroscopic findings of the spleen correlate with different lymphoma entities. However, most lymphomas are not primarily diagnosed in splenectomy specimens. Exceptions include splenic marginal zone lymphomas and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas that are typically diagnosed from histological findings. In addition, hairy-cell leukemia, LGL leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia typically show characteristic patterns of infiltration in the spleen which may be diagnostically useful. The different infiltration patterns of these tumors are discussed here.","1699":"Cholestasis in neonates and infants frequently confronts pediatricians and pathologists with diagnostic problems. A specific feature of the liver in neonates is the ability to react to different causative factors with a non-specific hepatitis-like picture, the so-called neonatal hepatitis. A diagnostic discrimination of the various diseases is histologically only possible with close attention to typical morphologic features. Thus, extrahepatic biliary obstructions, such as atresia or stenosis of the hepatic duct or choledochal cysts present with portal bile duct proliferation and signs of bile retention in the neoducts. In Alagille syndrome (arteriohepatic dysplasia), however, paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts is an important diagnostic feature. Metabolic disorders, such as fructosemia and galactosemia are additionally associated with steatosis. Knowledge of the clinical course and laboratory and imaging data are necessary to make the definitive diagnosis in synopsis with the morphologic findings and requires a close co-operation between the pediatrician and the pathologist.","1700":"Primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare neoplasms. While primary hepatic carcinoid tumors (PHCT) are well-differentiated tumors, primary hepatic small-cell carcinomas (PHSCC) represent the poorly differentiated end of the spectrum of neuroendocrine carcinomas. The first patient, suffering from PHCT, has had a follow-up for 32 years and is still alive. Within this time, the tumor relapsed 4 times with unchanged histology and immunohistochemistry features. The second patient suffered from small-cell carcinoma of the liver. There were no risk factors for a hepatocellular carcinoma. An extensive preoperative and postoperative diagnostic investigation could rule out an extrahepatic primary site. Immunohistochemically the tumor was negative for Hepar-1, AFP, TTF1 and CDX2 but reacted positively with CD56 and sporadically with the keratins 8, 18 and 20. A neuroendocrine PHSCC was diagnosed. After neoadjuvant cytostatic treatment the carcinoma was completely extirpated and 18 months after treatment the patient is healthy.PHCT and PHSCC have to be clearly separated from hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas. Exclusion of an extrahepatic primary site requires an accurate and synoptic analysis of clinical, radiologic and pathologic findings. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice.","1701":"Pathological findings in the liver sinusoids are mostly caused by extrahepatic or systemic diseases. Unclear fever, hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension or a mild elevation of liver enzymes are reasons for a liver biopsy leading to path-breaking diagnoses. Reactive intrasinusoidal lymphocytosis, especially with Epstein-Barr virus infections, has to be differentiated from predominantly intrasinusoidal lymphoproliferative malignancies. Intrasinusoidal megakaryocytes can be the first sign of a myeloproliferative or myelodestructive disease. Intrasinusoidal carcinosis and melanomatosis might present radiologically without tumor lesions and are easily overlooked histologically, in particular, if the critical cells have a similar size to hepatocytes. This also applies for intrasinusoidal storing macrophages. Gaucher's disease type I, and some other subtypes of inborn storage diseases might present for the first time in adulthood by hepatomegaly and Kupffer cell hypertrophy. Accompanying perisinusoidal fibrosis and immunohistochemical staining (CD68) can help to detect the large pale intrasinusoidal macrophages. In immunocompromized patients with fever, particular attention must be paid to intracellular agents, especially atypical mycobacteria and yeasts in non-granulomatous nested or dispersed Kupffer cells. Leishmaniasis with amastigotes in macrophages is accompanied by reactive sinusoidal plasmocytosis.","1702":"This article describes the grading and staging systems used in the clinical context for non-neoplastic liver diseases (chronic and autoimmune hepatitis, fatty liver and steatohepatitis, medicinal toxic liver damage, iron storage disease and gall duct diseases). Fibrotic parenchymal alterations can also be assessed as well as livers planned for transplantation, with respect to possible rejection reactions. The basis for the histopathological diagnostic procedure is the liver biopsy. The consistent and correct use of the histological scores is obligatory in the diagnostic assessment of non-neoplastic liver diseases. Different scores are available for the various liver diseases. These are qualitative and quantitative scores based on empiricism and the practical relevance has been effectively proven. Grading describes the inflammatory activity and staging the extent of fibrosis or structural disorders up to liver cirrhosis. In many instances staging is the histopathological criteria for the prognosis assessment and is, therefore, decisive for therapy indications and therapy initiation.","1703":"","1704":"","1705":"Hemophagocytic syndrome (macrophage activation syndrome) is a group of disorders characterized by clinical, histological and biological symptoms of T-lymphocytes\/NK cell-driven macrophage stimulation with subsequent hemophagocytosis which can be observed in various organs, particularly in the bone marrow and spleen. The main clinical symptoms include cytopenia, multiple organ dysfunction, fever unresponsive to antibiotics, hepatosplenomegaly and rash. Besides rare inherited immune system anomalies (primary hemophagocytic syndrome), the most prevalent etiologies of hemophagocytic syndrome are infections (viral, bacterial and parasitic), cancers, lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic diseases. Hemophagocytic syndrome is treated with immunosuppressives, cytostatic drugs, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulins\/anti-TNF antibodies and due to the multiorgan involvement and the associated high mortality, recognition of early serum changes, such as very high levels of ferritin is mandatory. The most relevant histological changes are the increase of histiocytes showing evidence of phagocytosis of erythroid cells, platelets and granulocytes as well as in the spleen a rarefaction of the white pulpa with lack of lymph follicles and abundant lymphocytes, plasma cells and plasma cell precursors in the pulpa cords.","1706":"Primary hemochromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, and Wilson's disease are the most common hereditary causes of unclear hepatopathy. Classical primary hemochromatosis (type I) on the basis of a homozygous mutation of the HFE gene, usually presents in adults with increasing hepatocellular siderosis and chronic progressive necroinflammatory liver disease. Homozygous AAT deficiency type PiZZ becomes manifest in newborns as a giant cell hepatitis or findings similar to bile duct atresia, in adults as chronic hepatitis or \"cryptogenic cirrhosis\". The heterozygous PiZ mutation can lead to PAS-positive hepatocellular AAT deposits increasing over the life time. Immunohistochemical detection of AAT deposits by specific PiZ antibodies is a highly sensitive and specific supplementary method. Molecular analysis of AAT and HFE genes in paraffin-embedded tissue or blood can confirm the diagnosis and allows the zygosity status to be defined. Wilson's disease has to be considered in children and young adults with unexplained histologic findings of chronic hepatitis or steatohepatitis. Rhodanin staining is the most effective histochemical method to detect free copper deposits, but negative staining results do not exclude Wilson's disease. In cases suspected of Wilson's disease further clinical exploration must be initiated. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and biochemical findings, which can be supplemented by mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene.","1707":"Liver biopsy plays an important role in the diagnosis of liver diseases. Nowadays, biochemical, immunological, functional and molecular tests allow the etiology of many liver diseases to be clarified. The liver biopsy contributes essential information about the stage and grade of inflammatory liver diseases on the basis of consensus criteria. These data influence treatment and help to assess the prognosis. In addition, the different patterns of fibrosis allow conclusions about the cause and progress of the underlying liver disease. Hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, unexplained severe course of hepatitis B, differentiation of simple steatosis from steatohepatitis, the differential diagnosis of cholestatic diseases, unclear hepatopathy, transplant pathology and last but not least, hepatic masses are the focal points of liver biopsy diagnoses. Increased risk of hemorrhage due to coagulation defects can be minimized by a transjugular biopsy. Liver masses can be effectively located and identified by radiologically or ultrasound-guided biopsy. Regular periodic conferences between clinicians and pathologists help to clarify individual problematic cases and will promote the diagnostic competence of both partners in hepatology.","1708":"Sinusoidal alterations unrelated to primary hepatocellular damage present without characteristic clinical findings and in these cases the liver biopsy is particularly important. Capillarization of sinusoids is characterized by closing of fenestration, formation of a basal membrane and by the expression of CD34 and is typical for active cirrhosis. In nodular regeneratory hyperplasia, capillarization indicates a local or general disturbance of perfusion. In large regenerative nodules, focal nodular hyperplasia and liver cell adenoma CD34-positive capillaries reflect afferent parts and CD34-negative sinusoids the efferent parts of the parenchymal vascular bed. HCC generally have a completely capillarized CD34-positive vascular bed. Hepatic angiosarcomas and epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can be easily overseen in liver biopsies, if they spread along the sinusoids without detoriation of the acinar architecture and without significant alteration of the surrounding liver cell plates. Toxic damage of endothelial cells, post-sinusoidal stasis and sinusoidal hyperperfusion are the underlying pathogenetic principles of sinusoidal injury. Rupture and loss of the perisinusoidal reticulin fibres lead to peliosis hepatis. In these cases liver biopsy might disclose occlusion of the terminal liver veins (VOD). Perisinusoidal fibrosis can be caused by intrasinusoidal accumulation of pathologic cells, advanced intrasinusoidal macrophagocytic storage diseases and by activation of the vitamin A-storing hepatic stellate cells. Perisinusoidal amyloidosis can be the first sign of an underlying B-cell neoplasia.","1709":"","1710":"Histopathology plays an important role in the diagnosis of graft complications following liver transplantation (LTX) and includes the diagnosis of underlying liver disease, assessment of the donor liver before LTX and control biopsies after LTX. Within the early period after LTX (time zero and first month) preservation\/reperfusion injury, as well as hyperacute and acute rejection may occur. Surgical vascular or biliary complications can cause parenchymal morphological changes. Within 12 months following LTX, histological signs of opportunistic infections and chronic rejection are frequent findings and disease recurrence is typical beyond the first year. Drug toxicity in liver allograft recipients can be induced by immunosuppressive therapy or other drugs. A high percentage of adult patients reveal histological features of idiopathic chronic hepatitis 6 months after LTX. Histopathological differential diagnosis of the combined underlying causes or complications is often difficult.","1711":"Of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 15-20% occur in the non-cirrhotic liver. All factors which cause HCC when liver cirrhosis (LC) is present, can also lead to HCC without LC. On the basis of the relative frequency, HCC can be roughly differentiated into 3 groups: 1) HCC, rarely occurring without cirrhosis (e.g. virus hepatitis, alcohol abuse). 2) HCC, frequently occurring without LC (alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). 3) HCC, consistently occurring without LC (glycogen storage disease type 1, consumption of oral contraceptives\/anabolic steroids). In groups 1 and 2 the level of hepatocellular toxicity necessary to reach LC is not yet achieved but the carcinogenic effect is already strong enough to induce HCC, possibly owing to the influence of additional carcinogens or host factors. In group 3, the carcinogenic effect is mediated by a long-standing alteration of the hepatocellular metabolism that is of low toxic effect and does not lead to cell death, but is nevertheless carcinogenic. In these cases, the initial formation of hepatocellular adenomas that subsequently transform into HCC is a common finding (adenoma-carcinoma sequence).","1712":"Clinical symptoms of Carney complex occurred in two female members of one family (mother and daughter). In addition to the clinical symptoms, we describe the pathological findings in the adrenals (pigmented nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex), heart (myxoma) and skin\/soft tissues (superficial angiomyxomas). Genetic investigation revealed a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 17 in both patients; this mutation had previously been described only in Carney complex type 1. Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed in both these cases, 13 years ago and 7 months ago, respectively. Lifelong cardiac surveillance is mandatory to prevent death from embolism or arrhythmia.","1713":"Primary central nervous system T-cell lymphomas are rare and have to be differentiated from reactive lesions. It is therefore essential to use all possible tools to establish the diagnosis, including immunohistochemistry, molecular genetic analysis, and\/or cytogenetic methods. In this paper we present the case of a primary cerebellar T-cell lymphoma in a 50-year-old man; a clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was documented. After two cycles of methotrexate therapy the patient developed Pneumocystis carinii-induced pneumonia, dying 10 weeks after his diagnosis. The autopsy did not reveal any residual tumour.","1714":"Though rare, splenic rupture is the most common indication for splenectomy. In the vast majority of cases ruptures are clearly related to trauma (traumatic ruptures); in other cases there is a pre-existing disease affecting the spleen (pathologic ruptures); and in a minority of patients no obvious reason can be identified (spontaneous ruptures). In approximately 10% of cases an iatrogenic cause, in the broadest sense (including side effects of drugs), and relevant histological findings (approximately half of which will be unexpected) can be anticipated. Knowledge of pathophysiological aspects of splenic rupture and assessment of simple macroscopic findings such as splenic dimensions and weight, and information on macroscopically visible lesions are of key diagnostic importance, as is accurate microscopic examination with targeted histological pattern analysis, supplemented as appropriate by histo- and immunohistochemical studies on adequately prepared material.","1715":"The UICC requires investigation of a minimum of 12 lymph nodes for adequate lymph node staging in colorectal cancer. Despite that, many authors recommend investigation of a larger number, and different techniques, such as fat clearance, have therefore been developed. In this study we introduce a novel technique involving ex vivo lymph node staining with intraarterial methylene blue injection in colon cancer. We compared 14 cases in which methylene injection was used with 14 cases from our records in which conventional investigation techniques were applied. The lymph node harvest differed highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) between the two groups, with average numbers of 28+\/-7 and 14+\/-3 in the methylene blue group and the unstained group, respectively. The largest difference occurred in the size group 2-4 mm (191 vs 70 lymph nodes). In 6 cases in the unstained group additional embedding of fatty tissue was necessary to reach an adequate number of investigated lymph nodes. Methylene blue injection is a novel and highly effective method that will improve lymph node preparation in colorectal cancer.","1716":"Spindle cell and epithelioid cell differentiation occur in both benign and malignant hyperpigmented melanocytic lesions. Reed nevus is characterized by compact, sharply circumscribed junctional cellular nests composed of slender hyperpigmented melanocytes shaped like spindle cells. Deep penetrating nevus is characterized by a diffuse dermal proliferation composed of small nests and fascicles of pale ovoid and epithelioid melanocytes. Cellular blue nevi often have a characteristic hourglass or dumbbell shape, with sharply circumscribed elongated nests and fascicles of pale, densely layered ovoid melanocytes and adjacent melanophages. Epithelioid blue nevus is characterized by large epithelioid melanocytes with abundant cytoplasm and melanin often concentrated to some degree in the cell membrane. Animal-type melanoma is a particularly hyperpigmented variant of melanoma in which large melanophages predominate and there are varying proportions of melamin-rich spindle-shaped and large atypical epithelioid melanocytes. Morphologically, pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma combines characteristics of both animal-type melanoma and pigmented epithelioid nevus. Malignant melanoma may occur in conjunction with a preexistent blue nevus. Malignant blue nevus is now regarded as a malignant melanoma mimicking a blue nevus in structure and pattern. It is therefore of paramount importance to view multiple mitoses within a cellular blue nevus-like proliferation as an alarm signal as they are usually indicators of a malignant melanoma.","1717":"Malignant melanomas make up a heterogeneous group of tumors characterized by particular genetic aberrations depending on their anatomic localization and UV exposure. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is found in the majority of melanomas, with either somatic missense mutations of BRAF or, considerably more rarely, mutations of N-RAS. The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found. So far, ancillary molecular studies are not regularly applied in the routine diagnostic procedures performed when malignant melanoma is suspected. In the future, however, the development of targeted molecular therapies will require that molecular pathological techniques are used to identify the melanoma patients who will most probably benefit from a particular therapy.","1718":"","1719":"In the case of many tumors, the development of cancer is associated with a loss of control over genomic integrity, resulting in alterations, determined by selection, of the genome of the cancer cells. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a method that can be used to assess the entire genome of tumor cells for the presence of changes in DNA copy number. CGH analysis has revealed that melanomas differ from melanocytic nevi in the presence of frequent chromosomal aberrations. CGH analysis of benign melanocytic tumors typically shows no clonally expanded chromosomal aberrations, while in the vast majority of melanomas gains and losses of particular chromosomes are found. As an exception, Spitz nevi show an increased copy number of chromosome 11p in about 20% of cases, something not found in melanoma. These marked differences between the aberration patterns of melanomas and melanocytic nevi can be exploited during differential diagnosis of melanocytic tumors in which histopathologic assessment yields equivocal results. In addition, it has also been shown with the aid of CGH and mutation analysis that melanomas are not a homogenous disease, but rather a group of genetically different tumors. A study checking for correlations between the chromosomal alterations in melanocytic tumors not classified at diagnosis and the course of illness in patients is currently under way.","1720":"Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm that more often tends to undergo regression. Clinically, variation in color is perhaps the most important hallmark of primary cutaneous melanoma. The change in color to white, off-white, blue-white and gray-white is a sign of (spontaneous) regression in malignant melanoma. Histopathologically the process starts with a dense lichenoid infiltrate of lymphocytes, and ends with fibrosis and\/or melanosis within a thickened papillary dermis. The dense infiltrate of lymphocytes permeates the thin melanoma and destroys the atypical melanocytes in the epidermis and the papillary dermis. A key concern is how to define regression in a reproducible way. Using the following definition, a statistically significant risk of metastases can be demonstrated in thin melanomas (&lt;1.0 mm) with extensive regression (&gt;50%): \"fibroplasia with an absence of epidermal and dermal involvement by melanoma cells, but allowing for (lentiginous) single-cell proliferation of atypical melanocytes along the dermo-epidermal junction\".","1721":"According to data from the literature and to new data from the German central registry for malignant melanomas from the German Society of Dermatology, a summary is given about the occurrence of malignant melanoma in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age. During the first 10 years of life the occurrence of a melanoma is extremely rare, but slowly increases after the first decade. Several studies have shown that young people often have amelanotic tumors resembling pyogenic granuloma. This correlates with a histopathological high number of nodular melanomas in this age group. A reason might be a delay in the clinical diagnosis of malignant melanoma in children and young adults. Clinical and histopathological examples of melanoma in young people are demonstrated. Pitfalls in differential diagnosis and simulators of malignant melanoma are described and illustrated by examples of a medium sized congenital nevus with extensive intraepithelial spread of single melanocytes resembling a superficial spreading melanoma and by a compound nevus in association with a lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.","1722":"Melanocytic nevi at special anatomical sites can evoke a histological picture easily leading to the false diagnosis of a highly atypical, dysplastic nevus or even malignant melanoma. It is therefore most important to recognize these lesions in order to differentiate them from \"true\" dysplastic nevi or malignant melanomas. The anatomical regions recognized as \"special sites\" are the head and neck, especially the ear, the milk line (axilla, mamae, mamillae, umbilicus, groin), acral regions (palms and soles, knee, dorsum of the foot) and flexural sites. The specific histological picture of these nevi is described as well as differential diagnostic considerations to differentiate these lesions from malignant melanomas.","1723":"Hypopigmented and achromatic melanocytic tumors with spindle cells represent a diagnostic challenge. Spindle cell nevi resemble neural tumors. Desmoplastic nevi imitate dermatofibromas. Hypopigmented and amelanotic blue nevi are variants of the common and cell-rich blue nevus with an enhanced difficulty to make a correct diagnosis due to the lack of pigment. All of the above benign melanocytic tumors with proliferations of hypopigmented spindle cells can more or less show aspects of desmoplastic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of these entities demands a combination of clinical and histological parameters as well as supporting immunostaining. Regarding desmoplastic melanoma, diagnoses frequently made are benign spindle cell neoplasms, scar or unspecific inflammatory condition. As the histological aspects can be so misleading, attention is necessary in order to make the correct diagnosis. Particular care must be taken to rule out desmoplastic melanoma in the case of spindle cell proliferations, a cicatricial or inflammatory process in the classical settings of face, volar skin, or mucous membranes. The spindle cell melanoma must be distinguished from other types of malignant spindle cell neoplasms, which can involve the skin. The differential diagnosis with such tumors is entrusted mainly to immunostaining.","1724":"Being a global information network, the internet has becoming increasingly important for pathologists as a medium for professional communication and information. Although a large number of pathology-specific websites (PSWs) are accessible on the internet, the potentials of PSWs are still barely known. Since there is no global catalog for all the pathology websites, certain PSWs are difficult to find on the internet. PSWs offer lavishly illustrated education material for undergraduates and postgraduates in pathology, but may also be very useful as reference books or as an instrument of continuing medical education (CME) for experienced pathologists. The spectrum of PSW media comprises electronic training manuals, journals, case collections, photo-archives, and even complete section series of virtual microscopy. PSWs are available at any time, can be updated permanently and linked to further online sources of information. We demonstrate how to find PSWs and present an annotated list of some 100 of the best PSWs.","1725":"Benign and malignant melanocytic neoplasms are relatively frequent and show a broad morphological heterogeneity. The spectrum of malignant melanomas comprises the four main types, superficial spreading malignant melanoma, nodular malignant melanoma, lentigo-maligna melanoma and acrolentiginous malignant melanoma. In addition the rare spitzoid malignant melanoma, desmoplastic malignant melanoma as well as some unusual variants of malignant melanoma can be distinguished. The latter include nevoid malignant melanoma, a form of malignant melanoma resembling benign melanocytic nevi, animal type malignant melanoma, an atypical melanocytic neoplasm with numerous melanophages and prominent melanosis resembling an atypical epithelioid blue naevus as well as regressive malignant melanoma, and representing a questionably distinct entity, balloon cell and signet-ring malignant melanomas, melanoma types with degenerative clear cell changes, as well as myxoid and osteogenic malignant melanomas that are characterized by unusual stromal changes.","1726":"Data from the literature and histopathological findings in six personal cases are used to illustrate criteria that can be applied in differential diagnosis between a Spitz nevus and a spitzoid variant of malignant melanoma. The diagnostic term 'atypical Spitz tumor' is explained; it is used to describe a morphological \"grey zone\" in which it is not possible to differentiate with adequate certainty between a Spitz nevus and a spitzoid malignant melanoma.","1727":"This review gives a short survey of cytological criteria of the most common salivary gland tumours. The emphasis is on a short and precise as well as practicable summary of the most important cytological criteria and comprehensive presentation without claiming completeness. In addition our own results were compared with other international data and publications.","1728":"","1729":"All practicable applications of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for palpable tumors or non-palpable lesions guided with endoscopic and imaging procedures are presented. Multidisciplinary procedures and the technical and biological aspects of FNAC are presented. Indications and diagnostic challenges of FNAC on selected organs and neoplasms are discussed based on personal experience and the literature. Skilled and well-trained cytopathologists, the quality of the aspirate and the cytological preparation as well as supplementary immunocytochemical and molecular genetic analyses are mandatory for reliable diagnostic results. The indications and advantages of liquid-based techniques are discussed.","1730":"Efficient, preferably early diagnosis of lung cancer represents a major challenge. Under this aspect the sensitivity of conventional histomorphology and cytomorphology procedures is unsatisfactory. This review highlights technical aspects, possibilities and drawbacks of the application of aberrant promoter methylation as a biomarker for lung cancer diagnostics using specimens of pulmonary exfoliative cytology.","1731":"The objective of screening for cervical cancer is to reduce mortality and incidence of the disease. To date there is extensive and strong evidence that this can be achieved by cytology-based screening programs, which continue to be the mainstay of cervical prevention worldwide despite their inherent methodological limitations. This article presents a review on the utility of conventional, ancillary and experimental methods for cervical screening both as single tests and test combinations, and describes possible future directions for enhanced screening accuracy using risk-adapted protocols.","1732":"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has become an established method for the diagnosis of infectious and interstitial lung diseases. Using a bronchoscope material from the peripheral airways and alveolar spaces can be obtained. When standard protocols are followed the procedure is generally well tolerated and in combination with clinical tests allows a reliable diagnosis in many cases. Certain clinical entities, e.g. alveolar proteinosis and Langerhans cell histiocytosis can be diagnosed by BAL alone without resorting to invasive diagnostic tests. In other diseases, BAL allows to narrow the range of the differential diagnosis. However, biopsies can often still not be avoided completely. A combination of both methods together with the clinical findings represents a powerful tool for diagnosis and research into the pathologic alterations in inflammatory and fibroising lung diseases.","1733":"Urinary cytology is used in the detection of nephrologic and uro-oncologic diseases. The advantages and limitations of cytology for the detection and follow-up of bladder cancer have been well known since Papanicolaou. The low sensitivity of urinary cytology, especially in the detection of more frequent urothelial tumors with low malignancy potential, led to the development of a number of new tumor markers. Nevertheless, the ideal tumor marker for bladder cancer has not yet been found. Cystoscopy combined with cytology is still the most widely accepted method for bladder cancer screening. The acceptance of this method can be improved by the use of case-specific preparation methods of a variety of materials. In addition to the follow-up of bladder cancer, urinary cytology is also used in the follow-up of renal transplant patients and therefore remains a worthwhile method leading to clinically relevant diagnoses.","1734":"Soft tissue swellings represent common clinical signs of a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Sarcomas are rarely the cause. Fine needle biopsy as a minimally invasive, economic and accurate method is well suited for the diagnostics of recurrent and metastatic diseases. Cytologic diagnosis of primary soft tissue tumors is also feasible but requires close collaboration with other medical disciplines and incorporation of clinical, radiological and morphologic findings. Clinical data such as age, gender, size and topography are also important parameters. Differentiation of the cells and the properties of the extracellular matrix offer initial indications for the differential diagnosis and are the starting point for immunohistochemical and molecular analyses (FISH, RT-PCR). These analyses can be performed on cytological smears, on paraffin-embedded cell blocks on snap frozen material.","1735":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method for the identification of chromosomal aberrations to improve the diagnostic performance of cytology. FISH is applicable to almost any type of cytological specimen irrespective of cell type, staining or fixation modality. Multi-target tests for the simultaneous analysis of four chromosomes or chromosomal loci improves the sensitivity of cytological diagnosis in bladder and lung cancer and is most helpful in equivocal cytology. FISH also allows a reliable distinction between malignant mesothelioma and reactive mesothelial cells. Specific translocations can easily be detected by FISH for precise diagnosis of lymphomas and sarcomas. Testing for HER-2 amplification has become a standard method to select patients with breast cancer for therapy with trastuzumab. Co-analysis of HPV and selected genes could become a useful approach in gynecological cytology. The spectrum of diagnostic FISH applications is continuously growing.","1736":"To evaluate the reasons for the occurrence of invasive cervical cancer in Carinthia despite cytological screening, all 132 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer in the years 2000-2002 were recorded and all gynecological cytological smears made within the 5 years prior to the diagnosis of cancer were reevaluated. Within the 5 years prior to diagnosis, no gynaecological cytological smear was found for 50% of the patients diagnosed with cervical cancer in the years 2000-2002. In the year 2002, a total of 53 patients were reported to have cervical cancer and 78 smears were reevaluated. Of all the smears primarily diagnosed as negative, 49% were found to be positive (&gt; or =Pap III) after reevaluation and 92% of all smears \"correctly\" diagnosed as negative showed quality deficiencies. The interobserver variability (kappa-statistics) showed a moderate value when the primary screening results were compared with the reevaluation. The interobserver variability within the group of reevaluators was also moderate. ","1737":"To optimize the reliability of histopathological criteria for periprosthetic infection, 110 tissue specimens from joint prostheses were analyzed with quantification of the inflammatory cells and immunohistochemical typing of lymphocytes and plasma cells. As reported in the literature the density of granulocytic infiltration was the most sensitive marker of periprosthetic infection with an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 67%, and a negative predictive value of 95%, using the mostly favored limit value of 5 granulocytes per HPF. T lymphocytes were also found to a high degree in cases of aseptic loosening. In contrast, B lymphocytes were predominantly seen in cases with periprosthetic infection. For B lymphocytes an accuracy of 80% and a sensitivity of 79% were calculated and for plasma cells an accuracy of 75% and a sensitivity of 79%. Our data suggest that the quantification of granulocyte, B-cell, and plasma cell infiltrates is an important parameter for verifying the diagnosis of periprosthetic infection.","1738":"Computer-based learning (E-learning) is of increasing importance for the education of students and professionals. Various publicly accessible online courses for cytologists now exist and some of these are presented in this paper. For the learning platform Patho-Basiliensis (http:\/\/www.unibas.ch\/patho\/) we have developed several learning materials: a database of 726 cytology images, a cytopathology course to teach the basics of cytopathology, and a game testing histologic-cytologic correlation. Tests on lung and urinary cytology were attended by 383 international participants. The virtual microscopy technology will revolutionize telecytology and cytology education.","1739":"","1740":"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide and its incidence is increasing. Multimodal strategies directed towards this carcinoma include primary (e.g. immunisation) and secondary (e.g. antiviral therapy) prevention, surgical approaches, novel specific systemic therapies (targeted therapy), and the treatment of comorbidity (cirrhosis). New molecular approaches are currently under development. These tackle several specific targets, with pathology being challenged in many aspects: experimental evaluation, the development of valid tumor-relevant diagnostic tests as well as morphological evaluation in the context of clinical studies, and finally in routine diagnosis.","1741":"","1742":"","1743":null,"1744":"Despite the fact that ovarian carcinomas are phenotypically heterogeneous, they can be divided into two main groups with common pathogenetic mechanisms. Based on clinical, pathological and molecular parameters, a relatively large group of tumors can be distinguished with stepwise development from benign precursors and borderline tumors to invasive carcinomas (type I). Depending on the morphological phenotype, characteristic genetic changes can be observed, such as mutations in KRAS and BRAF in serous borderline tumors and low-grade serous carcinomas. Mutations in KRAS are also frequently detected in mucinous borderline tumors and mucinous carcinomas. The group of endometrioid tumors is characterized by mutations in components of the Wnt-signal transduction pathway and PTEN or microsatellite instability. The second large group of tumors (type II) includes tumors with \"de novo\" development of highly malignant carcinomas such as the conventional (moderately to poorly differentiated) high-grade serous carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas and malignant mixed mesodermal tumors. These tumors are associated with frequent mutations in p53 and complex chromosomal alterations. In the future, the combined analysis of morphological parameters, genetic changes, gene-expression profiling and protein data will reveal possible diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ovarian carcinomas.","1745":"Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) is a rare, mostly benign tumor, which in 10-15% of cases shows a malignant behavior. The case of a 35 year old woman with pulmonary metastasis of a PSTT is reported. This finding was incidental in an atypical lung-resection due to pneumothorax. The literature on this rare tumor entity is reviewed especially in terms of differential diagnosis, biological behavior and association with a pneumothorax.","1746":null,"1747":"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the gynecological tumor with the highest mortality rate. Recently, numerous findings have emerged on the status and extent of surgical therapy for this disease. Innovations in the chemotherapy of primary and recurrent disease are also plentiful. It is essential for the improvement of the patients' situation to transfer these new developments, already integrated into national and international standards and guidelines, into clinical practice.","1748":"Teratomas are the most frequent germ cell tumors of the ovary. Two main groups can be distinguished: mature and immature teratomas. Mature teratomas are benign tumors, which are most often composed of derivatives of two or three germ cell layers. Only in rare cases is the transition into a malignant tumor observed (most often squamous cell carcinoma). In contrast, immature teratomas are malignant ovarian tumors. They contain immature tissue elements in addition to the mature components, most often consisting of immature neural tissue. Histologically, this tumor component can be identified as neurotubules or rosettes. The proportion of immature tissue elements defines the grade of immaturity. Four grades have been defined in to the WHO classification. Grade 0 represents a mature teratoma. With the exception of childhood cases, grade 2 and 3 immature teratomas are treated with chemotherapy. In childhood cases, foci of yolk sac tumor (YST) must be looked for, since this determines the prognosis. If a focus of YST is present, the patient is treated with chemotherapy. Both in cases of mature and immature teratoma, peritoneal implants can be found (gliomatosis peritonei), which are also graded. In cases of immature peritoneal implants, patients are also treated with chemotherapy. Gliomatosis peritonei is most likely derived from metaplasia of subperitoneal stem cells; it does not represent a metastatic disease of the ovarian teratoma.","1749":"Lymph node staging is the most important prognostic factor after radical surgery for colorectal carcinoma. The probability of correctly classifying a colorectal tumor increases with the number of lymph nodes harvested. This number varies with the methods used by the pathologist. An accurate examination of the surgical specimens is essential for the correct assessment of the lymph node status of the tumor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an easy fat clearance method using pure acetone. A total of 188 surgical specimens of colorectal carcinoma were investigated. The first lymph node preparation was made using the manual method. Thereafter, the mesenteric fat tissue was treated with pure acetone for 16 h and subjected to a second lymph node examination. In 111 of the samples the required number of 12 lymph nodes for TNM classification was not reached by the manual preparation method. With the acetone treatment, 12 or more lymph nodes were found 91% of these samples (average 27 lymph nodes). In 29 samples (15%) additional lymph node metastases could be detected. In 16 samples (8% of all investigated samples) an upstaging of the pN status was necessary. This indicates the importance of our method for the optimal lymph node staging of colorectal carcinomas. Lymph node preparation after acetone treatment is an easy, low cost method resulting in a much larger number of lymph nodes for more accurate staging.","1750":"Ovarian metastases comprise 7-10% of all malignant ovarian tumors. The detection of ovarian metastases is difficult because primary ovarian tumors are a morphologically very heterogeneous group, and metastases can simulate an primary ovarian tumor perfectly. A correct diagnosis, however, is most important in order to avoid an unnecessary and ineffective chemotherapy. Therefore, every morphologically unusual ovarian tumor should raise doubts. In addition, mucinous and endometrioid tumors may also be metastatic in nature. Immunohistochemistry, as well as knowledge on the patient's history, will clarify most of the suspicious cases.","1751":"Clinically and morphologically, two types of granulosa cell tumor can be distinguished, the more frequent adult type and the juvenile type. In the adult type, different growth patterns can be observed: microfollicular (most frequent, characterized by Call-Exner bodies), macrofollicular, trabecular, insular, solid-tubular, gyriform and diffuse (sarcomatoid). The juvenile type is characterized by solid and follicular structures. The neoplastic granulosa cells in the adult type have limited cytoplasm and haphazardly arranged angular, pale, mostly grooved nuclei. In the juvenile type, the cells have ample eosinophilic cytoplasm and polymorphic, sometimes bizarre nuclei, which are usually non-grooved. The number of mitoses in the adult type usually does not exceed 2\/10 HPF, whereas it is considerably higher in the juvenile type, including atypical mitoses. A common feature in both types of tumor is the expression of inhibin-alpha, calretinin and CD 99. Epithelial membrane antigen is negative. Molecular genetics has demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at 19p13.3 in 52% of the cases. Besides chromosomal aberrations, there are a large number of cytogenetic anomalies. The most important prognostic factor in both types of tumor is tumor stage. Whereas recurrences in the adult type can develop even after decades, in the juvenile type they usually occur during the first 3 years after diagnosis.","1752":"The enzyme histochemical reactions for acetylcholinesterase, lactic dehydrogenase, succinic dehydrogenase and nitroxide synthase are currently the gold standards for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal motility disorders. The acetylcholinesterase staining reaction shows the cholinergic nerve fibre network of the muscularis mucosae and muscularis propria, and correlates with their acetylcholinesterase activity. Lactic dehydrogenase, succinic dehydrogenase and nitroxide synthase selectively demonstrate the nerve cells of the myenteric and submucous plexus. These enzyme histochemical techniques require fresh, native tissue. Consequently, the transport of biopsies from gastroenterology or surgery to pathology must be well organized and feasible without time loss. Alternatively, biopsies may be mailed on dry ice to more distant pathology institutes. The enzyme histochemical laboratory technique has been optimized and refined over four decades. The optimized reactions are highly reliable and reproducible. In particular, a standardized methodology is a prerequisite for the interinstitutional comparability of results. This laboratory manual provides a detailed methodological description of the most important enzyme histochemical reactions for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal motility disorders.","1753":"","1754":"Intestinal innervation disorders are part of the broad etiological spectrum of chronic constipation and need to be specifically addressed in differential diagnosis. The enteric nervous system constitutes the largest peripheral nervous system of its own (\"brain in the gut\"), and is involved in the mediation of intestinal motility. Morphologically different nerve cell types aggregate into intramural plexus layers and release a multitude of neurotransmitters. Malformations or lesions of the enteric nervous system may lead to a severely prolonged intestinal transit time resulting in chronic constipation resistant to conservative treatment. In contrast to the early manifestation of aganglionosis, non-aganglionic or acquired alterations to the intramural nerve plexus often remain unrecognised up to adulthood. Histopathological diagnosis is carried out by enzyme or immunohistochemical staining, either on sections or whole mount preparations, allowing an optimal visualization of the nerve plexus architecture. To diagnose hypoganglionosis, enteric ganglionitis or alterations in interstitial cells of Cajal, full-thickness biopsies are required. Interstitial cells of Cajal contribute significantly to the mediation of intestinal motility by generating \"slow wave\" activity. In adult patients with slow-transit constipation and megacolon, the intramuscular networks of the interstitial cells of Cajal show a significantly reduced density.","1755":"Hirschsprung's disease is the most important type of gastrointestinal dysmotility in neonatal pathology. Aberrant craniocaudal migration of neural crest stem cells results in an intestinal aganglionic segment of variable length. In 'classical' Hirschsprung's disease (60-75% of cases), the aganglionic segment spans the rectum and sigma. Ultrashort Hirschsprung's disease (5-10%) is restricted to the most distal 3-4 cm or immediate rectoanal transition only. In the normal enteric nervous system, myenteric ganglia modulate the parasympathetic innervation of the sacral roots S2-S4. The absence of myenteric ganglia in Hirschsprung's disease results in massively increased parasympathetic activity with abundant acetylcholine release and pseudo-obstruction in the aganglionic segment. This can be demonstrated in an enzyme histochemical reaction for acetylcholinesterase on frozen sections, which is sufficient to diagnose the classical disease in rectal mucosal biopsies. In ultrashort Hirschsprung's disease, increased acetylcholinesterase activity is demonstrable only in nerve fibres of the muscularis mucosae and submucosa, but not the lamina propria mucosae. Submucosal and myenteric ganglia are physiologically scarce in the most distal rectum; absence of ganglia in a biopsy of the rectoanal transition must not be (wrongly) interpreted as ultrashort Hirschsprung's disease. Therefore, a diagnosis of ultrashort Hirschsprung's disease can be made exclusively using an enzyme histochemical reaction for acetylcholinesterase.","1756":"Hirschsprung's disease constitutes a neural crest stem cell disorder (neurocristopathy) which is caused by absent or malfunctional intestinal intramural ganglion cells. The rostral extension of the aganglionic segment is variable. Hirschsprung's disease can be classified into type 1 (short segment) and type 2 (long segment) forms. It is limited to the gastrointestinal tract, but may occur in the syndromal context of manifold genetic diseases in 12% of patients. The prevalence is 1:5,000 with a distinct male predominance of 4-5:1. Numerous genes and non-coding polymorphous DNA sequence variants are involved in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung's disease. The most important gene is RET. Susceptibility loci on 3p21, 9q31 and 19q12 interact with this gene. Downstream of RET, two new genes, GALNACT-2 and RASGEF1A, have also been identified. A recently described, frequent, non-coding RET variant, RET+3, is significantly associated with susceptibility to Hirschsprung's disease and carries a 20-fold increased risk of contracting the disease compared to rarer alleles.","1757":"Intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B (IND B) is currently considered to be a subtle malformation of the submucosal plexus, leading to an increased proportion of over-sized ganglia and potentially accompanied by a mild, chronic gastrointestinal motility disturbance. The diagnosis of IND B is morphologically based and involves the demonstration of an increased proportion of giant ganglia in the submucous plexus related to the patient's age. Giant ganglia are physiologically frequent in the neonatal period. Therefore, IND B should not be diagnosed prior to 1 year of age. Morphological features of IND B may occur as an isolated finding or may be observed proximal to an aganglionic segment. IND B and constipation may resolve spontaneously up to the age of 4 years. Treatment of IND B is usually conservative, surgical resection is currently deemed necessary only in a minority of patients. The pathogenesis of IND B is still incompletely understood and the etiology unknown. Future research on the basis of standardized diagnostic conditions is expected to result in a better understanding of this disease, and to reveal the cause of aberrant ganglion development.","1758":"With the introduction of immunohistochemical methods, histopathological diagnosis based on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue in coloproctology has substantially improved. In recent years, the routine use of immunohistochemistry for S100, cathepsin D and a picrosirius red staining has proven to be sufficient for the diagnosis of hypoganglionosis of the myenteric plexus and desmosis of the muscularis propria. In some cases, an immunohistochemical reaction for CD 117 is also necessary for the evaluation of Cajal cells. In contrast, in ultrashort Hirschsprung's disease, aganglionosis of the anal ring, aganglionosis of the musculus corrugator cutis ani, and internal sphincter, the histochemical acetylcholinesterase reaction is essential and not replaceable by any immunohistochemical method.Immunohistochemistry, classical histological stains and enzyme histochemistry are complementary histopathological techniques. In contrast to immunohistochemistry, enzyme histochemistry requires native cryostat sections for the assessment of enzyme activity. As a consequence, biopsy performance and transport to pathology departments should be particularly well organized.","1759":"In addition to the enteric nervous system, the interstitial cells of Cajal and the smooth musculature, the collagenous fibre network of the muscularis propria plays a major role in the coordination of peristalsis. Partial or complete absence of this network in patients with chronic constipation has been described as 'desmosis'. Two major subtypes of desmosis can be distinguished: in the rare congenital (primary) aplastic desmosis of childhood, the collagenous fibre network is not formed. This is characteristic of microcolon megacystis syndrome and is associated with aperistalsis. The more common atrophic (secondary) desmosis of adulthood is typically incomplete and associated with a hypoperistaltic syndrome. Neither the etiology nor the pathogenesis of desmosis are currently understood. Atrophic desmosis may occur after previous inflammatory episodes. Further extensive studies are needed to better understand the pathogenesis, etiology and functional implications of this disease.","1760":"The proto-oncogene RET is the major gene responsible for Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), with RET mutations also implied in different pathologies. A variety of mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have been detected in HSCR patients. Special attention should be paid to rare patients who carry mutations of one of the critical cysteine residues of these exons, known to predispose to MEN2A. In these cases, HSCR can be associated with the development of neuroendocrine tumors such as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or MEN2A, for which a prophylactic thyroidectomy is advisable in the presence of a tumor causing RET mutation. In combined MEN2A\/HSCR families, RET gene testing, tumor screening and prophylactic thyroidectomy are indicated as in MEN2A. The multigenic origin of HSCR and the absence of a \"standard\" RET mutation associated with HSCR currently make a routine molecular diagnosis impossible.","1761":"We present the findings of a 67 year old male patient with an intestinal leiomyomatosis localized in the rectum. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of intestinal leiomyomatosis reported so far. The most characteristic findings of this rare disease include a cuff-like tumorous proliferation of smooth muscle within the bowel wall which may extend into extramural tissue and result in a stenosis of a longer bowel segment. Because of severe obstructive symptoms over 5 years, the patient had to undergo surgery with resection of the rectum. The histological examination revealed a morphology and immunophenotype comparable to usual leiomyomas with the exception of hyalinosis-like changes in the blood vessels, apparently a special feature of leiomyomatosis. A novel finding in our case was the occurrence of skeinoid fibers which have so far only been reported in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","1762":"","1763":"Stem cells are self-renewing cells with the potential to generate different cell types. The human organism depends on stem cells for organ development during embryogenesis. Upon completion of organogenesis, stem cells are also necessary for organ maintenance (\"homeostasis\") and for tissue regeneration. In view of the manifold functions of stem cells, it is not surprising that their malfunction results in diseases like Hirschsprung's disease, a disorder of the enteric nervous system of complex etiology. Potential stem cell application for the regeneration of diseased organs, such as the enteric nervous system in Hirschsprung's disease, is currently a focus of intense research.","1764":"Hypoganglionosis comprises 3-5% of gastrointestinal innervation defects which are connected to therapy-resistant chronic constipation in children and adults. Similar to Hirschsprung's disease, hypoganglionosis may be complicated by megacolon formation and must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Three main subtypes may be distinguished: congenital hypoplastic hypoganglionosis occurs predominantly in Hirschsprung's disease proximal to the aganglionic segment and consists of small paucicellular ganglia with increased interganglionic distances. Oligoneuronal dysganglionic hypoganglionosis manifests in childhood. Initially, myenteric ganglia are of normal size and have normal interganglionic spacing and normal neuronal content. However, nerve cells are hypoplastic and ganglia undergo progressive nerve cell loss. This type of hypoganglionosis may progress into atrophic hypoganglionosis, which shows a morphology similar to hypoplastic hypoganglionosis. All subtypes of hypoganglionosis result in decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in the nerve fiber network of the muscularis propria. The pathogenesis of hypoganglionosis is still poorly understood. In Hirschsprung associated hypoganglionosis, mutations in the RET and GDNF-genes have been found. Despite a heterozygote GDNF+\/- animal model for hypoganglionosis, no GDNF mutations have so far been demonstrated in human Hirschsprung independent, isolated hypoganglionosis.","1765":"Chronic constipation in childhood results from (1) psychological\/behavioural causes, (2) functional or organic gastrointestinal outlet obstruction, or (3) slowing of transit within the colon. Functional chronic constipation is treated by a complex conservative bowel management. Constipation refractory to routine medical treatment reveals, in a significant number of cases, organic causes. Histology of bowel biopsies is essential for the preoperative diagnosis of chronic constipation. Defective innervated bowel segments require surgical treatment. Intraoperative histological staining of bowel biopsies allows proper resection of aganglionic or dysganglionic bowel. This contribution describes the interdisciplinary, clinicopathological interactions involving children with chronic constipation.","1766":"","1767":"Among aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, a reproducible morphological and immunohistological distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (centroblastic variant) is impossible in a substantial number of cases. The German reference centres for hematopathology collected 220 retrospective cases of aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma whose classification according to the current World Health Organisation criteria was reviewed. Gene expression analysis (Affymetrix) was performed in all cases and chromosomal translocations were determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Chromosomal losses and gains were analysed by matrix comparative genomic hybridisation and clinical data were successfully collected for most patients. The application of a novel bioinformatics method led to the identification of a stable and reproducible gene expression signature specific for Burkitt's lymphoma. A total of 44 cases were identified by this molecular signature [designated molecular Burkitt's lymphoma (mBL)]. These molecular Burkitt's lymphomas showed the morphology and immunohistology of classical or atypical Burkitt's lymphoma cases in 29 instances. However, 15 of the molecular Burkitt's lymphoma cases had the morphology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or could not be further specified. All molecular Burkitt's lymphomas showed an expression of BCL-6 and CD10, but a MYC translocation was not demonstrable in more than 10% of cases. Of significance is that more than 20% of the molecular Burkitt's lymphomas expressed BCL-2, although weakly in most instances. Our data demonstrate that: (1) the morphological, immunophenotypical and genetic spectrum of Burkitt's lymphoma is broader than previously expected, and (2) our molecular Burkitt's lymphoma signature enables a more precise and extended definition this lymphoma.","1768":"Roughly 30-40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) arise primarily in extranodal sites. Most frequently, they occur in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the gastric mucosa. They also occur in the central nervous system, as testicular lymphomas, in the lungs, or in the skin. Morphologically, they show the whole spectrum of peripheral B-blasts: centroblasts, immunoblasts, or plasmoblasts. Thus, there is no actual difference in their cytomorphological presentation compared to their nodal-and frequently systemic-counterparts. However, recent data point to profound differences in primary extranodal DLBCL compared to primary nodal tumors, as well as to each other, frequently relating to their molecular characteristics and especially implying organotypic features. These characteristics may relate to a particular organotypic site of origin, or the particular clinico-pathogenetic setting in which the tumors arise. This is exemplified in the description of the DLBCL subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization classification (mediastinal or intravascular B-cell lymphoma; primary effusion lymphoma). On the other hand, primary extranodal DLBCL are frequently characterized by a particular (cyto-)genetic constitution, often related to their site of origin. Finally, some preliminary data on gene expression profiling strongly argue in favor of particular gene signatures for primary extranodal DLBCL, and hence in favor of particular organotypic transformation pathways.","1769":"Enteropathy type T-cell lymphomas (ETL) are the most frequent T-cell lymphomas arising in the gastrointestinal tract. Commonly, the neoplasm is clinically associated with symptoms of malabsorption, and it frequently manifests as a spontaneous bowel perforation. Among ETL, two types can be distinguished by morphology, immunophenotype and, possibly, by pathogenesis. A total of 80% of ETL are characterized by a close association with celiac disease, pleomorphic cytomorphology and the rare expression of CD8 and CD56. In contrast, 20% of ETL show a monomorphic small to medium size cytomorphology and frequent expression of CD8 and CD56, an association with celiac disease is rare in the latter cases. Genetically, ETL is characterized by frequent and recurrent chromosomal gains of 9q33-q34.","1770":"Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of the MALT type constitute, with around 8% of all B-cell lymphomas, the third most frequent lymphoma in the Western hemisphere. Their unifying characteristic principle is their origin in organs that are typically devoid of a regular lymphatic parenchyma (\"primary\" MALT). In contrast, \"secondary\" MALT is acquired in these sites by chronic inflammatory processes triggered by chronic infections or autoimmune diseases. The organotypic characteristics of these particular lymphoid tumours are also mirrored by organ-specific precursor lesions and in tumour biology. Usually, MALT-type lymphomas remain confined to their site of origin for a long time, disseminating only late during the course of the disease. Hence, they may be controlled by local treatment (excision, irradiation). Moreover, the distinctive genetic constitution of MALT-type lymphomas, although varying from organ to organ, indicates particular transformation pathways obviously related to the specific precursor lesion and, hence, of organ-specific quality.","1771":"Indolent (low-grade) B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, such as follicular and mantle cell lymphomas, are primarily nodal lymphomas in which lymph node involvement is the dominant clinical feature. The frequency of extranodal manifestations of these primarily nodal lymphomas is often underestimated. The typical growth pattern of nodal lymphomas can be absent or not evaluable because the biopsy specimens are often small in cases with extranodal involvement. Therefore, the immunophenotype of the lymphoma cells is of great importance for the diagnosis of indolent lymphomas with extranodal localizations.","1772":"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas comprise 8% of the malignant lymphomas in Germany. About 25% of these cases present primarily in extranodal localizations. Such localizations are typical for the respective disease and form the basis for the classification of extranodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The morphology, immunophenotype and lineage specificity of the tumor cells (originating from T- or NK-cells) is only secondary for the classification. Extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphomas of the nasal type are characterized by an angiocentric growth pattern and large confluent areas of necrosis. In addition, there is a clonal infection by Epstein-Barr virus in the T-lymphocytes. In the differential diagnosis, B-cell lymphomas are more frequent at all localizations than T- or NK-cell lymphomas.","1773":"Mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is a locally highly aggressive tumour which was first described in the early 1980s. The incidence is about 2-3% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The conceptional evolution of this lymphoma entity was hampered by its low incidence and the broad spectrum of morphological variants present. However, since mediastinal B-cell lymphoma has distinct morphological, immunological, genetic, and clinical features, it has been listed in the revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL-Classification) since 1994 as a variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In the World Health Organization classification of malignant lymphomas, mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is now listed with an own disease code (ICD-9679\/3).","1774":"Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas include cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma (PCFCL), cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL) and cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCLBCL) \"leg type\" which are the three main types in the new WHO-EORTC classification for cutaneous lymphomas. PCFCL and PCMZL are indolent lymphomas with an excellent prognosis while PCLBCL shows an aggressive clinical course. All three types must be distinguished from a secondary skin involvement by systemic lymphomas. Since histological and immunohistochemical findings are not decisive, making this distinction requires appropriate staging procedures. In contrast, the pathologist can make an important contribution to the differential diagnosis between neoplastic and reactive cutaneous lymphoproliferations.","1775":"","1776":"KSHV\/HHV 8 infection is associated with primary effusion lymphoma, multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) and MCD-associated plasmablastic lymphoma. We report the case of an HIV-infected male with Kaposi sarcoma, MCD in the lymph node and development of a KSHV\/HHV 8-associated plasmablastic lymphoma in the liver. Immunohistochemistry revealed an HHV 8 infection of plasmablasts showing cytoplasmic IgM\/lambda expression. To the best of our knowledge, liver infiltration by a MCD-associated HHV 8 positive plasmablastic lymphoma has not been documented previously. The differential diagnosis is discussed.","1777":"A 65-year old man presented with acute abdominal pain and fever. The initial diagnosis was small bowel gangrene. Pathology revealed small to large abdominal vessels obliterated by cells of intravascular B-cell-lymphoma (IVL). Visceral IVL involvement is common at autopsy but rarely reported in patients with acute abdomen. The subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy, which in typical cases is characterized by cephalic or cutaneous manifestation. Few cases showed involvement of large vessels which in combination to fibrin thrombi may lead to infarction of the organ involved. Thus IVL should be considered in cases of ischemic diseases with fever of unknown origin.","1778":"Ectopic prostate tissue is a rare occurrence in the lower female genital tract. Possible theories of histogenesis include a developmental anomaly, metaplasia of preexisting endocervical glands, and derivation from mesonephric remnants. We report an example of prostatic tissue involving the uterine cervix of an 82-year-old woman as an incidental finding in a hysterectomy specimen. This unusual lesion should be differentiated from atypical glandular lesions of the cervix. Immunohistochemical studies confirm the histological suspicion of ectopic prostatic tissue.","1779":"Articular cartilage has poor reparative capacities, and once damaged cartilage lesions remain chronic and can lead to osteoarthritis. Over the last decade, several innovative therapies have been introduced to promote the regeneration of articular cartilage while sustaining sufficient mechanical stress and permitting a pain free motion. An important measure of outcome is the morphological characterization of the repair tissue in order to allow for cross-study evaluation. The International Cartilage Repair Society has developed a analogue visual scale to quantify repair tissue, which is described in this paper.","1780":"Rheumatoid granuloma (RG) is histomorphologically defined as a subcutaneous palisading granuloma with central fibrinoid necrosis. Clinically, it presents as a nodule typically localized at pressure points near the joints. From the rheumatic pathological point of view, the main diagnostic challenge is the differentiation of RG from granuloma anulare, especially if clinical information on the site of removal, known diseases, duration of illness, medication and existing American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria are missing. Other granulomatous lesions, such as mycobacterial infections, foreign body granulomas, necrobiosis lipoidica or sarcoidosis, can be differentiated from RG by histopathological criteria or by additional examinations such as pathogen specification or PCR. An immunohistochemical marker for the differential diagnosis of granulomas is not yet available. Diagnosis is based on conventional H-E staining, alcian blue-PAS staining, polarizing analysis or PCR. In the following article, the most important granulomatous entities in the differential diagnosis of RG are introduced and the main diagnostic characteristics are discussed.","1781":"Degenerative arthropathy (osteoarthritis) is one of the most common diseases in modern western societies, in particular in the elderly. The classification and grading of changes during cartilage degeneration represent complex endeavors which are only of limited value in daily pathological practice. In general, the process of joint destruction can always be evaluated for the determining pathogenesis (\"typing\"), extent (\"staging\") and degree of the most extensive focal damage (\"grading\"). However, for routine use one might best restrict description and reporting to the most essential features. This is in particular true for specimens obtained from endoprosthetic surgery (hips and knees), because there is currently no specific clinical relevance for further evaluation. Only the identification of secondary types of degenerative changes, such as those due to unknown rheumatoid disease, gout or extensive osteonecrosis, is of particular interest to the clinical colleague (i.e. typing of the joint lesion).","1782":"The implantation of total joint endoprostheses has become a routine procedure, being executed about 1.5 million times per year worldwide. The indications are osteoarthritis, rheumatic diseases, trauma and bone neoplasia. However, about 5-12% of patients develop pain and impaired function of the endoprosthesis within 10 years, necessitating revision surgery. During this operation, the so-called periprosthetic membrane between bone and prosthesis is removed. This connective tissue membrane has a pathogenetic impact on the loosening process and can be evaluated by histopathology. This article aims at elucidating the defined histomorphological criteria for the standardized diagnostics of periprosthetic membranes using a recently established classification system.","1783":null,"1784":"This review presents an algorithm for the standardised histopathological diagnostics of synovial biopsies and synovectomy specimens. In general, changes of the synovium can be inflammatory or non-inflammatory. To the latter group belong certain benign tumors such as the diffuse variant of the tenosynovial giant cell tumor, lipoma or synovial chondromatosis, additionally the rare group of storage diseases should be kept in mind. Inflammatory diseases can be discriminated into crystal-induced arthropathies such as gout and pseudogout, into granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and foreign-body inoculation, and into the large group of non-granulomatous synovitis. This group is by far the most common, and it often causes difficulties in assigning the histopathological findings to a concrete diagnosis. Therefore, the synovitis-score should be applied as a diagnostic device in these cases, leading to the diagnosis of a low-grade synovitis (which is associated with degenerative arthropathies) or of a high-grade synovitis (associated with rheumatic diseases), the sensitivity and specificity being 60.5% and 95.5%, respectively.","1785":"","1786":"The aseptic prosthetic loosening of hip and knee prosthesis is the most important cause of implant insufficiency. Bone loss as a result of the biological effect of wear particles is the main cause of such loosening. Wear particles develop their biological activity along different cellular pathways, above all via macrophages, foreign body giant cells as well as fibroblasts of the periprosthetic membrane. These cells induce particle-dependent bone resorption by means of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and PGE2. These factors induce the activation of osteoclasts as well as the suppression of osteoblasts. Neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes do not play an important role in the process of aseptic loosening. The different wear particles, such as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, metal particles, ceramic particles and polymethylmethacrylate can be morphologically recognized very easily. From the clinical point of view, the differentiation between acute or chronic implant infection and particle induced prosthetic loosening is very important, with the histomorphological differential diagnosis between septic and aseptic loosening and their combination being the key clinicopathological factor.","1787":"Amyloid is a pathological protein deposit in tissue which has a red eosin color when the slice preparation is stained with traditional hematoxylin and eosin and after Congo red staining under polarized light exhibits a characteristic apple-green polarization color. Over 26 different autologous physiological proteins have been described that can form amyloid. In surgical pathology, immunoglobulin light chain-associated AL amyloidosis is the most frequent generally occurring amyloidosis, followed by hereditary and nonhereditary ATTR amyloidosis and AA amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis mostly develops subsequent to chronic infectious or inflammatory underlying disease and can represent a potentially life threatening complication. The spectrum of causes for AA amyloidosis has changed in the past few decades and is now determined by chronic rheumatic diseases and hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Early diagnosis of an amyloidosis and its correct classification continue to pose a great challenge. Precise classification of the amyloid and amyloidosis is essential for prognosis assessment and treatment planning. In addition to anti-inflammatory management of AA amyloidosis, specific treatment strategies may possibly become available in the future.","1788":"Alternatively to sending glass slides via mail order, the German division of the IAP established a digital slide training portal on the Internet. Following the principle of virtual microscopy, histology slides were scanned completely in high resolution, stored on a server, and can be accessed over the Internet. The slide training portal can be used with current Internet browsers without additional plugins. Working on digital slides with the virtual microscope is easy but flexible. Loading a detail image using image streaming technologies takes about 500 ms with the German research network (DFN) and about 3 s with DSL. The digital slide training portal of the German IAP provides a clear choice and is always available for every member. Despite the little experience some users had with the Internet and diagnostics at the monitor, image quality and usability were rated as good.","1789":"","1790":"The term papilloma applies to benign proliferative epithelial breast lesions with a papillary architecture. The papillae in such lesions contain an arborizing fibrovascular core, glandular surface epithelium and a basal myoepithelial layer. A basement membrane encloses these structures. Papilloma may occur at any site in the ductal lobular system and according to its localization is subdivided into two types: solitary (central) papilloma which are located in the major nipple\/subareolar ducts or large segmental ducts and multiple (peripheral) papillomas in cystically dilated terminal ductal lobular units (TDLU). Stromal changes, epithelial metaplasia and\/or proliferations and neoplasia may alter the prototypical architecture. In a significant number of papillomas atypia can be identified which have to be classified as atypical proliferates of the ductal type. These lesions must be distinguished from the papillary type of ductal carcinoma in situ. Some 17% of all papilloma are associated with (synchronous) intraductal or invasive carcinoma, but these also act as an indicator for subsequent (metachronous) carcinoma. As a consequence, in minimally invasive biopsy papilloma has to be classified as B3 and usually has to be followed by surgical excision.","1791":"A subset of rare benign and malignant breast tumors with and without myoepithelial differentiation are morphologically and histogenetically similar to salivary gland tumors, but may differ in incidence and clinical behavior. The clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, molecular and prognostic features of ten salivary gland-like tumor entities of the breast are discussed and compared with their respective counterparts in the salivary glands.","1792":"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous disease that progresses to invasive cancer in 30-50% of the patients. Its natural history is poorly defined so that we are unable to identify cases of DCIS that do not progress to invasive carcinoma during an individual's lifetime. However, pathologic features of DCIS are nowadays the basis for the estimation of the prognosis and planning of therapy. Exclusion of microinvasion, characterization of nuclear grade, architecture, size and distribution of the DCIS, presence or absence of comedonecrosis as well as the assessment of surgical margins are relevant factors for local treatment. The determination of steroid hormone receptor status is indicated in patients considering tamoxifen therapy after breast conservation. It is advisable to evaluate the features according to internationally accepted guidelines with proven prognostic relevance and reproducibility. Nevertheless, better prognostic factors are needed to adapt the management of this increasingly diagnosed disease to the individual patient.","1793":"The grading of invasive breast cancers according to Bloom and Richardson (Nottingham modification) provides one of the most important prognostic factors in addition to size and the status of the lymph nodes. Diagnostic reproducibility has been problematic in daily practice as the required criteria for selection and extent of the grading area are frequently not present in the punch biopsies.A total of 346 cases were retrospectively used to compare routine grading from surgical preparations with an equivalently small sample from punch biopsies. In addition, a modified grading of these small samples was developed with Ki-67 immunochemistry and the measurement of core size. In the case of modified grading, 1-3 points were given for Ki-67 and average maximum core diameter. Tubule development was evaluated with 1 or 2 points. A comparison for recurrence free survival and total survival showed significant prognostic differences between 3-5 points (low risk) and 6-8 points (high risk) in uni- and multivariate analyses. The evaluation criteria for Nottingham-Bloom-Richardson grading in a small tissue sample, such as that from a punch biopsy, can hardly be fulfilled. In our series, prognostic value was only found for nodal negative cases. After modification using objective parameters such as nuclear size measurement and Ki-67 proliferation index, a small tissue sample can prove to be of significant prognostic value for nodal negative as well as nodal positive cases.","1794":"Only little information on the primary molecularbiological events involved in early breast is available. In particular, the definition of postulated precursor lesions of invasive breast cancer, such as ductal hyperplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ, is under an intense, controversial discussion in terms of pathogenesis and tumor biology. The most recent research on biological regulation mechanisms and genetic alterations in morphologically normally appearing breast tissue give rise for a reinterpretation for the most common progression models of breast cancer. The detection of genetic alterations within normal breast tissue in particular challenges the commonly postulated relationship between invasive and in situ breast carcinomas on the one hand, and benign, proliferative breast lesions on the other. The concerns about these relationship are further supported by the description of different cellular compartments within the normal female breast, including a \"progenitor cell compartment\" with different cytokeratin expression patterns, which can be transferred towards well known or suspected precursor lesions of invasive and in situ breast cancer. The aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the most recent results and developments in breast pathology, and to describe the consequences of our changing understanding of breast carcinogenesis.","1795":"The term lobular neoplasia (LN) includes lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular neoplasia (ALH). It is generally considered to be a risk lesion and a non-obligatory precursor for the subsequent development of an invasive carcinoma in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast. LN has also been termed lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LIN). A grading system (LIN 1-LIN 3) has been suggested as a tool for a more precise estimation of the individual risk. When LN is the most significant finding in a core biopsy, the probability of a higher grade lesion is about 17% in the follow-up surgical biopsy, justifying follow-up surgery in the majority of cases. A higher risk of progression is attributed to LIN 3 (pleomorphic LN, extensive LN, and signet ring cell LN) compared to LIN 1 or LIN 2. These special forms of LN may have an unusual presentation clinically or histologically. Using immunohistology, LN are characterized by the loss of E-cadherin, low proliferative activity and by positive hormone receptor status. The molecular characteristics of LN are similar to those of invasive lobular carcinomas, indicating the nature of LN as a precursor lesion.","1796":"Medullary carcinoma of the breast has a relatively favorable prognosis despite its malignant histopathological appearance, providing a challenge for the pathologically based diagnosis of breast cancer. Macroscopic and microscopic findings combined provide diagnostic criteria. The importance of the immunophenotype of medullary carcinoma is not well defined. Because the reproducibility of morphological criteria is limited, we conducted an immunohistochemical study in search of markers that could facilitate histopathological classification. We examined 32 medullary carcinomas in comparison with 30 high grade ductal invasive carcinomas with similar morphology using 23 different immunohistochemical markers. The results showed an overlap with the so called basal like subtype of invasive breast cancer (negativity for steroid hormone receptor, positivity for basal cytokeratins). None of the immunohistochemical markers enabled a specific discrimination between the two groups. Medullary carcinomas overexpress EGF-R more frequently (P&lt;0.004). In combining the characteristic morphological criteria and the immunohistochemical detection of the basal like phenotype and EGFR, a higher diagnostic accuracy can be achieved. The immunophenotype alone does not allow a definite classification of medullary carcinoma.","1797":"The goal of the present study lies in the comparison of differently funded health care structures, with emphasis on certain aspects regarded to be essential for medical progress. For this purpose, mammary intraoperative frozen sections pooled from a total of 4163 intraoperative frozen sections obtained from representatively selected departments of pathology from East and West Germany before and after reunification were analysed comparatively. Our results clearly demonstrate a profound change in the role of intraoperative mammary frozen sections, with a predominantly diagnostic function in the former German Democratic Republic as a tool for histopathologically evaluating \"questionable\" mammary lesions. The use of such sections changed towards a predominantly therapeutic function during surgical treatment as a means of organ preservation after the German reunification.","1798":"","1799":"Columnar cell lesions are being increasingly identified in specimens excised for mammographically suspect microcalcifications. The entity of flat epithelial neoplasia remains a challenge for surgical pathologists due to its uncertain biological and clinical significance, inconsistent nomenclature, lack of prognostic data and the often unobtrusive and easily overlooked histological findings. This review aims to summarize our experience and the currently available literature on this topic, and will lead to a better understanding of this lesion. Because of its putative role as a precursor lesion and its many similarities to atypical ductal hyperplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ, differentiation from these lesions on the one hand and from columnar cell lesions without atypia on the other, is of importance and should result in different therapeutic recommendations depending on its presence in excisional or core needle biopsies.","1800":"The Bavarian Mammography Screening Program started in April 2003. A detailed analysis of the consistency of diagnosis in the evaluation of vacuum-assisted stereotactic or core needle breast biopsies is presented. A total of 32 pathologists participated in a blinded evaluation of the biopsies. Each case was evaluated independently by two participating pathologists. A total of 1,357 cases were reviewed. The histopathological reports of the biopsies made by the two consulting pathologists were compared. The concordance rate of the first and second consulting pathologist was 93% for the B-classification. In general, the level of diagnostic agreement was very high for well defined, benign and malignant lesions. Some of the discrepancies resulted from the incorrect application of the B-classification. Discrepancies in the reports were also due to divergent interpretation of benign and \"borderline\" lesions. The protocol for the blinded evaluation of breast biopsies in two rounds assured a high level of quality. In conclusion, prerequisites for the success of a mammography screening program are interdisciplinary consensus conferences and audit rounds involving pathologists.","1801":"","1802":"","1803":"A careful macroscopic description with selection of representative tissue for histological examination is required for quality assurance, for assessing prognostic factors and for answering legal questions in (pre)cancerous lesions of the cervix uteri. Exact and standardized gross inspection and preparation are decisive for the quality of the histopathological statement. The extent of cervical carcinomas should be given in three dimensions, including the relative depth of invasion into the cervical wall. The report should include size, type (according to the WHO classification) and grading of the tumor, the presence of lymphatic as well as blood vessel invasion and perineural involvement. The statement for resection margins should include the vaginal, parametrial, rectal and vesical directions. It is also mandatory to document the number of lymph nodes with metastatic disease in relation to the total number of nodes investigated. The staging should follow the TNM system. In the handling of conisation specimens, it is important to appropriately document localization, horizontal expansion, depth of invasion including microinvasion of any dysplastic or malignant lesions. Clockwise dissection of the conisation specimen, total submission, and step sections are recommended. The preparation of exenteration specimens is a highly skilled job: the exact tumor dimension should be given in its relation to all resected organs and structures with special focus on resection margins.","1804":"With the introduction of DRGs (diagnosis related groups) in 2004, a new charging system was initiated in Germany. Changes primarily involve lump sum based charging of inpatient cases regardless of the duration or complexity of diagnostic procedures and therapy, and the equalization of costs for similar services. Calculation of DRGs also includes the costs of autopsy. This has three major consequences for autopsy practice: Quality assurance: continuous monitoring of professional quality under lump sum payment can only be permanently guaranteed and independently and reliably attained by autopsy. This is the only way to overcome the danger of abolishing essential diagnostic procedures because of economic pressure and thus risking incorrect diagnoses. Economy: additional diagnoses revealed by autopsy will, in many cases, raise calculated charges. This could have a significant financial impact. Legal certainty: autopsies increase the accuracy and objectivity of diagnoses. Thus, they protect the attending physician from incorrect charging which may be unintended but could be legally relevant, especially when the cause of death is unclear. For these reasons, autopsy should become more important in clinical routine.","1805":"Caroli's disease is a liver disease with segmental cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. It belongs to the group of congenital ductal plate malformations. With an incidence of only 0.05% of all liver cases in the Liver Registry of the University of Cologne, it is a very rare disorder. Caroli's disease is usually combined with cholangitis and bile duct stones. Control of these infections and maintenance of biliary drainage are the main therapeutic aims. The development of intra epithelial neoplasia and invasive carcinoma are rare complications. We report a case of Caroli's disease with the development of cholangiocarcinoma and review the literature.","1806":"Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) is characterized by a non-cirrhotic micronodular transformation of the liver parenchyma. It is based on the obliteration of small portal veins. Macroregenerative nodules (MRN) develop in areas of favourable blood flow in otherwise hypoperfused liver tissue. Hypoperfusion is caused by obliteration of liver veins and\/or large portal veins with the subsequent atrophy or extinction of parenchyma. The hyperperfused and sometimes rapidly growing MRN might simulate a malignant tumor in CT and MRT. Morphologically, MRN resemble FNH. In contrast to hepatocellular adenoma, they show a more or less nodular architecture with fibrous septa and ductular structures. NRH and cases of MRN without cirrhosis can indicate an extrahepatic\/systemic disease causing altered liver perfusion. MRN in liver cirrhosis must be differentiated from dysplastic nodules and highly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma by cytological and microarchitectural criteria. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) can imitate liver cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, cholangitis or chronic hepatitis, if biopsy material does not include normal perilesional liver tissue. Telangiectatic FNH might resemble classic hepatocellular adenoma. Neoductular structures and septation argue for this rare subtype of FNH. Neoductular transformation of hypoperfused liver parenchyma might imitate cholangioma or cholangiocarcinoma.","1807":"The considerable progress made in radiology, in surgical management with curative intent, and in the identification of molecularly targeted small molecules, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors has greatly influenced the treatment of sarcoma manifestations within the liver. This requires not only the unequivocal pathomorphological differentiation of sarcomas from other tumor entities, e. g. spindle cell dedifferentiated\/pleomorphic carcinomas, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas or amelanotic malignant melanomas, but also an accurate subtyping of this complex group of tumors. Additionally to macroscopic and histological findings, the recognition of characteristic immunophenotypic constellations and, at least in some types of sarcoma, the identification of molecular signatures, have greatly expanded the diagnostic tools in pathology.","1808":"","1809":"The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will continue to increase for the next decade due to a latency of about 30 years due to cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C. The diagnosis of an underlying cirrhosis is of diagnostic importance. According to WHO guidelines, HCC encompasses the following: trabecular, pseudoglandular, acinar, compact, scirrhous and fibrolamellar subtypes. Cytological appearance includes hepatocellular pleomorphic, clear cell and sarcomatous subtypes. Tumor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma may display intracytoplasmic inclusions that are helpful for establishing the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis has to be considered for such hepatic tumors as adenoma and precancerous lesions such as dysplastic nodules or mesenchymal tumors. Metastases in the liver may be difficult to differentiate, especially for primary tumors from the gastrointestinal tract which may be similar to glandular or scirrhous type of HCC. The existence of underlying cirrhosis is helpful for the diagnosis and an ample spectrum of antibodies against liver antigens and adenocarcinomas are commercially available to confirm the correct diagnosis.","1810":"The correct diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is often confounded by the small size of the diagnostic specimen and the wide morphological range of carcinomas metastasising to the liver. Expression analysis of cytokeratins, glycoproteins, mucoproteins, adhesion molecules, receptors and transcription factors has been shown to be a valuable adjunct in the typing of carcinomas. For this study, the expression pattern of 30 well documented antibodies to CC and the most common metastatic adenocarcinomas of the liver were studied. CC show a rather distinct immunophenotype with co-expression of CK7, CK17, CD7 and a lack of CDX2. Although this pattern allows the separation of CC from most metastatic carcinomas, pancreatic carcinomas show a broad overlap with this expression pattern.","1811":"Primary hepatic lymphomas represent rare neoplasms, which are partly observed in association with chronic viral hepatitis, immunosuppression and autoimmune diseases. In contrast, secondary hepatic lymphomas are much more frequent and represent disseminated disease. Lymphomas involving the liver include, with decreasing frequency, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Many B-cell lymphomas in the liver reveal a characteristic infiltration pattern allowing a rapid and cost-effective diagnosis based on focused immunohistochemical analyses. In contrast, most T-cell lymphomas show a more diverse morphology, which is sometimes difficult to differentiate from a reactive condition. Therefore, additional molecular analyses are frequently necessary. The differential diagnosis includes hepatitis and inflammatory bile duct diseases, undifferentiated carcinoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor as well as histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms.","1812":"Up-to-date clinical oncology requires an exact and standardized way of classifying tumors. Experience shows that mistakes can occur more frequently than generally expected during the classification procedure and documentation. Several possible sources of errors will be mentioned in this contribution. Errors can occur in localizing the exact site of the primary tumor, which can lead to an incorrect classification of metastases in lymph nodes, e.g., N1\/pN1 instead of M1\/pM1. Difficulties in histological typing of liver tumors, particularly in the differential diagnosis between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) can be minimized by using immunohistochemistry. The grading of HCC can be performed according to two systems, namely those of Edmondson and Steiner and of the WHO. The grading system used should be indicated. For estimating the anatomical extent of primary liver tumors, vascular invasion is an important parameter. Resection margins have to be thoroughly examined to aim at an most exact residual tumor classification.","1813":"In contrast to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), very few molecular pathological studies have been carried out on hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). Particularly from the surgical point of view, based on views passed on verbally and in the literature of the 1970s and 1980s, a possible degeneration of the HCA provides grounds for operating. Published cases of transitions from HCA into HCC were evaluated on the basis of today's morphological standards. A comparison was made between the patterns of new molecular pathological studies of HCA, above all the work of our own groups, and those of HCC. The results speak against the suggestion that a typical solitary HCA in pre-menopausal women is a precursor lesion of HCC. After a critical review of the literature, only one casuistic case of a transition of HCA to HCC under a hormone therapy, which is no longer practiced today, remained. A limitation of particular HCA in genetic and metabolic diseases, children, adult males, adenomatosis, and HCA-like tumors with known risk factors of HCC would seem pragmatically meaningful. With classic HCA, however, the oncological indication for surgery does not apply. A prerequisite is a histological clarification, if necessary with the support of molecular pathological methods.","1814":"Methylation takes place when a methyl group, comprised of a carbon and three hydrogen atoms (CH3), attaches to the individual DNA bases. This modification of the DNA leads to a change in gene expression. Changes in the methylation status of the DNA belong to the most common gene changes leading to malignant tumours. Recent studies have shown that three different mechanisms play a role in the effect of methylation: global hypomethylation, hypermethylation of individual gene segments and the deregulated expression of DNA methyltransferases. Such DNA methylation is also one of the most homogenous and consistent molecular changes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, the hypermethylation of specific genes has been shown to precede the development of malignant tumours. Thus, DNA methylation is a possible biomarker for the early discovery of HCC. The reversibility of methylation also offers a possible future treatment option.","1815":"Quite frequently clinicians avail themselves of works of well known artists in order to illustrate certain diseases. In contrast, pathologists find it harder to use art to demonstrate morphology. My approach to compensate for this is twofold: on the one hand, with 8 mostly three dimensional wooden objects with either mirror or aluminium elements, on the other with 449 collages consisting of pictures exclusively with a medical background (histology, radiology, nuclear medicine) or showing a combination of histological or cytological photos with pictures of flowers, trees or landscapes. My experience is that this technique arouses interest in complex medical issues even with medically unqualified individuals.","1816":"(123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a radio-labeled catecholamine analogue, is used for the imaging of pheochromocytoma based on the selective uptake of MIBG by chromaffin tissues. MIBG scintigraphy displays high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (close to 100%). In contrast, the false-positive uptake of MIBG by adrenal cortical carcinoma is rare. Here, we report a metastatic oncocytic adrenal cortical carcinoma with MIBG uptake used for therapeutic purposes.","1817":"Primary renal carcinoid tumors originating in normal kidney are extremely rare. We report a case of primary renal carcinoid tumor with an aggressive clinical course and multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the liver as well as a pulmonary metastasis, in a 30-year-old patient. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large mass in the right kidney and multiple tumor suspect areas in the liver and paraaortal lymph nodes. The patient did not have clinical manifestations of carcinoid syndrome. Histologically, the tumor was composed of trabecular, solid or anastomosing ribbon-like nests, identical to the features of neuroendocrine tumors from other locations. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin, neurospecific enolase, and chromogranin. Electron microscopically, tonofibrils, primitive desmosomes, and dense-core granules with a neuroendocrine appearance were present. The pathological features of this case are briefly reviewed in comparison with those of previously reportet in terms of certain clinical aspects, prognostic factors and the WHO-classification (2004) of this rare neoplasia.","1818":"The case of a renal oncocytoma involvement by metastasis from breast carcinoma in a 83-year-old woman is reported. The literature of tumour-into-tumour metastasis is reviewed. In conclusion, metastasis of breast carcinoma to a benign renal tumour is very rare.","1819":"Hepatotoxicity is a significant complication of therapeutic drug use. As ist can imitate nearly all hepatopathies, the diagnosis of drug-induced liver disease is difficult. Most often, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. The following morphological changes are known, dependent on the target cell type: acute and chronic hepatitis, granuloma formation, and fatty liver disease, cholestatic type acute and chronic liver damage with or without inflammation,or mixed forms of liver injury. Portal or perisinusoidal fibrosis can occur following each type of liver damage. Vascular changes or neoplasms are rare. Drug induced liver injuries are more likely induced by type B damage, which is not expected and cannot be reproduced in animal testing. Type A damage, which is known from toxicity assays, is less likely. A specific therapeutic regime is not available. Therefore, early recognition and cessation of the use of the drug is necessary.","1820":"Granular cell tumors are, in almost all cases, benign soft tissue tumors, although malignant variants have rarely been described in a variety of anatomical locations. In the case presented here, a so-called atypical granular cell tumor was diagnosed based on two criteria, being differentiated from the usual histological findings by enhanced mitotic activity and focal spindle cell proliferation. Further suspicious characters of the tumor were its size of 13x10x5 cm on MRT as well as its long-term clinical course (1.5 years). The diagnostic procedures undergone until resection of the tumor, including the macroscopic and histological findings, are presented. The diagnosis can be made with certainty by using conventional histology in combination with immunohistochemistry. The tumor cells react positively with antibodies against S-100 protein, NSE, laminin, myelin proteins and myelin-associated glycoproteins. These staining patterns underscore the neural origin of the tumor tissue. In this case a mitotic frequency of two per ten high power fields and focal spindle cells led to the diagnosis of an atypical granular cell tumor, whereas the criteria for a malignant variant were not met.","1821":"Mature teratomas belong to the group of germ cell tumors of the ovary. They account for 27-44% of all ovarian neoplasms and up to 58% of all benign tumors of the ovary. In mature as well as in immature teratomas, secondary tumors originating from the three embryonic tissue components may be found. These tumors can show benign or malignant behavior. We report the case of a meningothelial meningioma, found within a mature teratoma of a 32 year old female. The characteristic histomorphology and immunohistochemical expression for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and desmoplakin are diagnostic.","1822":"","1823":"Interstitial pneumonia is a rare disease, posing a diagnostic challenge to pneumologists, pediatricians, radiologists and pathologists. Only by the combined efforts of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has has been possible to standardize the formerly different European and Northern American nomenclature of interstitial lung diseases (alveolitis versus interstitial pneumonia) in adults and to clearly and unambiguously define the diagnostic criteria. The ATS\/ERS classification of 2002 comprises seven entities: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), lymphocyte interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). Using the ATS\/ERS classification of interstitial pulmonary diseases in premature infants, infants and children is problematic, since UIP, RB-ILD and AIP do not occur at this age. Although infants with severe respiratory insufficiency may sometimes show morphological features similar to DIP or NSIP, this entity should rather be classified as chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) because of differences in etiology, pathogenesis and prognostic outcome.","1824":"We studied angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) expression in lung tissue from patients with different forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in comparison with that from morphologically normal lung specimens. ACE antigen expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry in morphologically normal lung tissue from 33 patients (19 males, 32-77 years; 14 females, 34-93 years) and compared to that in specimens from 94 patients (67 males, 30-97 years; 27 females: 27-90 years) with different clinically proven forms of PH (according to Venedig classification). Type specific vessel expression pattern as described for normal lung tissue was generally intensified in arteries, arterioles and capillaries of the lung specimens with PH. Specimens with PH due to left heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) showed only very weak or no augmented arterial ACE expression, while PH due to collagenoses or interstitial lung disease showed significantly higher ACE expression. In human PH there is--comparable to animal models--a raised ACE expression in pulmonary lung vessels, with differences between the various forms of PH. These differences in ACE expression may be relevant for subtly differentiated therapeutic anti-ACE therapy regimes.","1825":"Segmental mediolytic arteriopathy (SMA) is defined as non-inflammatory arteriopathy with mediolysis due to segmental loss of media and consecutive formation of vascular gaps. Up to now, less than 40 cases of visceral and cerebral SMA and, to our knowledge, only one case of pulmonary SMA have been reported. We present the history of a 21 year old female patient, admitted to hospital with hemoptysis, but without other symptoms. Apart from two lesions in the sixth and tenth pulmonary segment, documented by CT and interpreted as colliquations, there were no other clinical and laboratory findings. Repeated bronchoscopy supplied no further information. Histomorphology of the resected lesion revealed SMA without evidence of vasculitis. Wegener's disease could be excluded. The aetiology of the disease is still unknown. Acute vasospasm (due to inappropriate reactions to catecholamine or endothelial dysfunction), as well as SMA as a precursor or subtype of fibromuscular dysplasia, are two theories still under discussion.","1826":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a term which has recently been redefined and includes idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, familial pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH related to specific pathological conditions (e.g. connective tissue diseases), as well as PAH caused by veno-occlusive disease or capillary hemangiomatosis. The clinical manifestation seems to be related to a peculiar pathological anatomy involving small, muscular pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins. In addition to common hypertrophy of the tunica media, other vascular compartments may also be affected by intimal thickening or adventitial fibrosis. Moreover, complex lesions, such as so called plexiform lesions and arteritis can be present in certain forms of the disease. While the recent identification of responsible gene mutations in subgroups of patients have shed some light on disease evolution, therapeutic strategies must currently rely on vasodilative and antimitogenic drugs acting on the intimal and medial level of the affected pulmonary vessels. The clinical outcome of patients suffering from PAH remains poor, underlining our need for a better comprehension of disease pathophysiology, and thus for the characterization of specific histomorphological patterns.","1827":"The morphological diagnosis of small mesothelial lesions in pleural biopsies is gaining importance in view of more aggressive, multimodal therapeutic options and of medicolegal aspects if a malignant mesothelioma is diagnosed. We present a light microscopically and immunohistochemically based morphological classification for the planning of further clinical follow-up procedures. A reactive mesothelial hyperplasia heals without scars. Mesothelial inclusions in pleuritic scars are common in recurrent pleuritis and must not be confused with an epithelioid component of a desmoplastic mesothelioma. In case of atypical mesothelial proliferations, further diagnostic procedures have to be performed to obtain a clear diagnosis of malignancy. Mesothelioma in situ is the first morphological step in neoplastic mesothelial changes, also with regard to medicolegal aspects for the unambiguous diagnosis of a mesothelioma. Early infiltrative growth is characteristic of so called early mesothelioma. A useful immunohistochemical panel for the differential diagnosis consists of anti-cytokeratin, Ck 5\/6, calretinin, EMA and MiB-1, whereas the immunohistochemical detection of telomerase is not helpful.","1828":"The histological classification of lung tumors is based upon the 2004 WHO classification. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is primarily treated by means of anti-neoplastic chemotherapy, independently of the tumor stage. In resectable stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, UICC-stages I and II), complete tumor resection is the aim. Therefore, the distinction between SCLC and NSCLC is still of particular importance. Currently, great interest is focused on the identification of specific therapeutic targets, especially on the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor ruptur (EGFR). Today, malignant lung tumors can also be classified by means of molecular pathology. Subgroups with different prognoses can be identified by gene expression profiling. The expression levels of several genes are associated with sensitivity against certain anti-cancer agents.","1829":"15 cases of pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (carcinoid-tumorlets, diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia\/DIPNECH) and 20 neuroendocrine pulmonary tumors (10 carcinoid tumors, 5 large cell neuroendocrine, and 5 small cell neuroendocrine lung carcinomas) were immunohistochemically analyzed for the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, = HER-1). All cases of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia exhibited a maximum EGFR expression (score 3 in 100% of cells) showing predominantly membranous, partly cytoplasmic staining. 4 ot the 10 carcinoid tumors were strongly positive for EGFR, whereas the other 6 were EGFR-negative. A total of 90% of large cell neuroendocrine and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas were negative for EGFR. Overexpression of EGFR in pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia might be significant for the pathogenesis of these lesions. As DIPNECH is characterized by clinical signs and symptoms including mild cough and obstructive functional impairment, a specific antagonistic therapeutic trial could aim at blocking EGFR\/HER-1 or its subsequent signal transduction pathway.","1830":"Imatinib (STI571, Gleevec\/Glivec) and other small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors are highly effective in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors and, for example, eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloproliferative disorders. This molecularly targeted approach disrupts abnormal tyrosine kinase dependent signalling pathways, thus providing a preferred treatment option for selected neoplastic disorders with activating mutations of Abelson-, Abl-related-, Kit-, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A and B genes. Loss of response to imatinib may be due to an acquired resistance of emerging mutant tumor cell clones. Therapy is generally well tolerated. However, toxicities including edema, skin rashes, fatigue, nausea and myelosuppression have been reported. Philadelphia\/Bcr-Abl-negative clonal chromosomal abnormalities may develop. Bone marrow trephines obtained from CML patients in complete remission with prolonged pancytopenia secondary to imatinib generally show marrow hypoplasia. Morphological features may be in keeping with either aplastic anemia or myelodysplasia developing in Philadelphia-negative hematopoiesis. Single or multilineage myelodysplasia may be accompanied by an excess of blasts and rarely evolves into acute leukemia in CML patients. Severe adverse hematological effects of imatinib are extremely rare. Current questions involve the molecular mechanisms of hematological side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with special regard to the emergence of distinct aberrant clones.","1831":"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) of the lungs (syn.: intravascular bronchioloalveolar tumor\/IVBAT) is a neoplasm with a vascular line of differentiation. This study provides a clinicopathological analysis of 11 cases of this tumor. There were 7 female and 4 male patients. Patients' age ranged from 33 to 83 years (mean: 49.8, median: 48 years) showing 2 peaks (third\/fourth and sixth\/eighth decades). The typical radiological appearance revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules from 0.5 to 2 cm. In 2 cases, a striking perivascular and intravascular growth pattern associated to pulmonary veins was evident. All tumors were characterized by epithelioid tumor cells with nests, cords and strands embedded in a sclerosing, hyaline matrix with alveolar, bronchiolar and vascular extension. Necrosis was identified in 8 tumors and ossification in 2 tumors. The mitotic index was below one mitosis in 10 HPF. By immunohistochemistry, all tumors were positive for CD 31, CD 34, and vimentin, 60% positive for factor VIII, and negative for pancytokeratin and calretinin. Follow-up was available for 8 patients with a range of 6 to 105 months (mean: 51.5 months, median: 52 months): 3 patients died (2 certainly from their tumors), 4 are alive disease-free, and one is alive with metastases. EHE of the lungs (IVBAT) represents an intermediate-grade, malignant, mesenchymal neoplasm with a characteristic histological appearance and immunohistochemical profile.","1832":"The frequency of drug-induced damage to the lung in inpatients is estimated to be about 10%. Pathoanatomically, varying damage patterns result, ranging from acute pulmonary edema via inflammatory reactions to pulmonary fibrosis. The ATS\/ERS 2001 classification, which is based on the suggestions made by Liebow 1969, is an accepted system for classifying findings according to recurring patterns. Generally, there are no specific morphological findings which allow safe conclusions on possible administered drugs. Clinical information is mandatory. Differentiation from pulmonary alterations due to the underlying disease is often difficult. In daily routine diagnostics, it is important to consider iatrogenic causal factors in cases of \"undetermined pulmonary disease\".","1833":"Therapy related alterations to the thyroid gland are associated with more or less specific morphological changes. The therapy (thyrostatic drugs, radio-iodine) may be administered for the treatment of thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism), or the thyroid gland is involved during or after the treatment (irradiation, various drugs) of primarily non-thyroid related diseases. The present review summarizes the most important morphological changes related to therapy.","1834":"The pain-relief properties of NSAID\/ASA preparations have been known for a long time. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract shows side effects such as: erosion, ulceration, and even perforation. In the upper gastrointestinal tract, our group has shown that a correct histological diagnosis of NSAID\/ASA induced lesions can be made in a high percentage of cases on the basis of recognition of ischemic necrosis. NSAID\/ASA induced lesions are less commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract. We could also demonstrate a correct histological diagnosis of NSAID-colonopathy on the basis of finding ischemic necrosis. Besides the known complications, another typical complication is diaphragm-like stenosis, which must not be mistaken for tumor stenosis. The differential diagnosis of NSAID-colonopathy includes ischemic colitis, which cannot be distinguished histologically if the exact endoscopic description is not available. Sometimes NSAID\/ASA induced lesions are misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease due to the focal character of the lesions. Since all of our analyses are retrospective, the criteria developed by our group should be checked prospectively.","1835":"Malignant Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has become a curable disease through the increasing intensity of the treatment strategies applied. These regimens are aggressive, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy leading to the possibility of secondary malignancies. The German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group considered three cohorts including 5,411 patients with all stages of HL. In 127 patients a secondary solid tumor was diagnosed (cumulative risk 2%, median follow-up 72 months), with bronchial carcinomas (23.6%) and colorectal adenocarcinomas (20.5%) being the most frequent neoplasms. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia was found in 36 patients, another ten developed myeloid dysplasia (cumulative risk 1%, median follow-up 55 months). A total of 52 patients revealed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; cumulative risk 0.9%, median follow-up 46 months). The overall incidence of secondary malignancies was 3.9% in patients who had been treated successfully for their HL with radio- and\/or chemotherapy.A secondary NHL can be particularly difficult to be distinguished from the preceding HL. Therefore, in case of a suspected relapse, a complete histopathological work-up must be performed.","1836":"Malignant tumors are increasingly being treated with therapeutic agents having molecular mechanisms of action (so-called biologics). These include therapeutic agents for the blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The adverse drug reaction profile associated with EGFR inhibitors is dominated by cutaneous lesions. Most common are acneiform skin reactions followed by xerosis, eczema and changes to the hair and nails. The cutaneous changes vary greatly between individuals and may be relatively insignificant. However, they may also prevent continuation of therapy. During the use of EGFR inhibitors, a correlation was observed between the severity of cutaneous changes and the effectiveness of the therapeutic agent, a finding potentially useful for individual dose adjustment.","1837":"Tamoxifen belongs to the group of selective estrogen modulators (SERM) which bind to both the alpha and the beta-estrogen receptors. Depending on the type of tissue, tamoxifen has either an anti-estrogenic or an estrogenic effect on the cells. In the treatment of breast cancer, the anti-estrogenic effect is used. However, at the same time there is a predominant progestin-like and only mild estrogenic effect on the endometrium. Depending on the hormonal situation of the patient, tamoxifen can cause different morphological changes in the endometrium. On ultrasound, these changes are normally diagnosed as a thickening. However, endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma is identified histologically in only a few cases. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis is endometrial atrophy or endometrial polyp. Other findings related to tamoxifen therapy are stromal decidualisation, regressive hyperplasia, and foci of mucinous, clear cell and serous metaplasia. The main reason for the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia on ultrasound could be fibrosis and edema along the border between the endometrium and myometrium. Still unsolved is the question of whether endometrial carcinomas developing after tamoxifen therapy belong mostly to type I (endometrioid) or type II (serous, clear cell) carcinomas. Only in rare cases do malignant neoplasms other than carcinomas develop after tamoxifen therapy. These are adenosarcomas, carcinosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas.","1838":"Radiation therapies of pituitary adenomas induce an increase in fibroses and nuclear pleomorphism. Most growth hormone (GH) secreting pituitary adenomas react to somatostatin analogues by a distinct decrease of GH secretion. In two thirds, levels of IGF-1 can be normalized. Some cases show a shrinkage of adenomas that correlates with fibrosis of the tumor. With these drugs, thyroid stimulating hormone secreting adenomas can also be treated. Prolactin secreting adenomas are mostly treated primarily with dopamine agonists. Up to 90% of cases show a strong decrease in hormone secretion and a distinct shrinkage of the adenomas based on strong decrease in adenoma cell volume. Long-term medication with high doses of glucocorticoids induces Crooke's cells in the anterior pituitary. These are suppressed ACTH cells and characterized by increased numbers of large lysosomes and dense bundles of cytofilaments.","1839":"Nodular fasciitis is a frequently occurring pseudosarcomatous fibrous proliferation which usually affects the subcutaneous tissue. In the present study, we investigated tissue specimens from 26 patients with intramuscular nodular fasciitis. The median age of patients was 31 years, with the tumors occurring mainly in the extremities (11 patients) and the trunk (11 patients). These had an average size of 2.6 cm. Males predominated (male:female 9:4). Histological examination revealed a proliferation of myofibroblasts (positive for smooth muscle-actin) embedded in a myxoid or fibrous stroma. In 25\/26 cases, myogenic giant cells were observed (positive for desmin, negative for smooth-muscle actin and CD 68). Less frequently (11\/26 patients), osteoclastic giant cells were found (positive for CD 68, negative for desmin and smooth-muscle actin). In intramuscular nodular fasciitis, myogenic giant cells are encountered more often than previously described. They are relevant for the differential diagnosis of sarcoma and fibromatoses, since they can be misinterpreted as neoplastic giant cells. However, the uniformity of the myofibroblastic proliferate and the myogenic phenotype of the giant cells without proliferative activity (no mitoses, negativity for Ki-67) lead to a correct diagnosis.","1840":"The clinical manifestation of fluorosis has become rare over the past years. Although the use of fluoride medication in osteoporosis therapy remains controversial, past study results have led to a reduction in fluoride prescriptions. Several studies have shown minor biomechanical properties of newly built woven bone compared to original bone. Despite new prescription protocols, fluoride therapy should not be disregarded in the anamnesis of osteoporosis patients. In addition to conventional diagnostics in fluorosis, new techniques such as microanalysis and micro-CT-analysis show a diagnostic benefit. In this case, the edx-microanalysis results show an F concentration of over 1.0 wt% in bone. The ratio of bone to tissue volume, evaluated by micro-CT, is clearly elevated at 46% BV\/TV. The histopathological preparation of the femoral head has made the possible effects of fluoride medication on bone visible and quantifiable. A direct causal relationship between coxarthrosis and fluoride medication, found both in our patient as well as in the literature, has not been demonstrated. In order to better understand the broad effects of fluoride medication in combination with coxarthrosis more studies are needed.","1841":"Although neoadjuvant, antihormonal therapy does not lead to an improvement in the outcome of prostatic carcinoma it is still used in the short-term in a subset of patients. Here we report the regressive changes due to this short-term treatment and analyse the impact on Gleason grading. The most frequent regressive changes in 82 tumors treated short-term were determined and quantified. The results were compared to a matched control group and also to the preoperative needle biopsies.A steep increase in regressive changes was observed within the first 4 weeks. After this point, changes increased only mildly. Within the first 2 weeks of treatment no significant changes compared to control tissue were present. Compared to the preoperative needle biopsies, pretreated tumors showed a significant upgrading. After 2 weeks of neoadjuvant antihormonal therapy, regressive changes are so great, that Gleason grading can no longer be recommended.","1842":"Adverse drug reactions (ADR) occur in about 5% of all pharmacologically treated patients. Between 2% and 20% of all hospital admissions are caused by ADR, and approximately 10% of all hospitalized patients experience ADR during their hospital stay. Several thousand patients die due to ADR in Germany each year. ADR-associated drugs come predominantly from the class of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, acetylsalicylic acid and cardiovascular drugs. Most ADR cases present as gastrointestinal bleeding and adverse cardiovascular effects. Apart from this, one or more drugs are withdrawn from the market each year because of unwanted but mostly rare side effects. In recent years the most prominent cases were rofecoxib, cisapride and cerivastatin. Physicians in Germany are obliged to report ADR. A substantial proportion of ADR, however, is not reported because it is deemed to be either too well known or the association between the drug and the adverse effect is too doubtful. In some cases, histopathological findings are needed to determine the diagnosis of ADR. Accordingly, physicians should inform the pathologist whether an ADR is suspected and which drugs may be responsible.","1843":"The structure of the normal adrenal cortex is changed by stimulating hormones (ACTH) and inhibiting hormonal drugs (especially glucocorticoids). ACTH induces hyperplasia and lipid depletion in the fascicular and reticular zones, whereas glucocorticoids lead to atrophy and lipid accumulation in both zones. In animal experiments, the adrenostatic drug mitotane causes shrinkage of the cells of the fascicular and reticular zones, whereas metyrapone induces a decrease in the steroid producing organelle system and aminoglutethimide leads to an increase in lipids. In the therapy of patients with adrenocortical cancer, mitotane can cause an increase in of necrosis and fibrosis, but also in intracellular lipid. The ultrastructure shows increased liposomes, more pigment-rich lysosomes and laminated bodies.","1844":"Percutaneous large core biopsy of the breast with a 14-gauge needle, supported by sonographic and mammographic procedures, shows a high degree of safety during the collection for benign and malignant lesions. All malignant diagnoses (B 5) with a portion of 44% (267\/604) were confirmed surgically, whereby the typing with 79% and grading with 58% were congruent. In 3.3% (20\/604), there was uncertainty (B 3 and B 4), with the necessity for further clarification by open biopsy. This was supported by the fact that in 10\/16 operated cases carcinoma was found. In the B 2-category, with a portion of nearly 44% (264\/604), four cases of cancer were verified--not due to a wrongly negative histology but to non-representative material. In 8.8% (53\/604), a questionable representative histology (B 1) occurred, but no cancer was found after surgical intervention (n=7). The indication for surgery is not only the punch biopsy result, but additionally negative histology and suspect or malignant clinical findings.","1845":"Many patients die in hospitals and care centers. It is therefore necessary to create an environment for the dying person, as well as for relatives, which allows death to occur with dignity while also permitting a dignified farewell. A special room should be available for taking leave of the loved one and for the mourning of the relatives. This room should, as far as possible, be neutrally decorated while at the same time it should be appropriate for various cultures and religious requirements. In order to be able to take leave symbolically, it is necessary to place the departed in the light, for example from a window.","1846":"The recent discovery of the estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha, ERbeta) and the progesterone receptor (PR) in human prostate tissue offers new insights into the role of estrogens and their receptors in prostate cancer development and tumor progression. The differentiation compartment of the prostatic epithelium (secretory luminal cells) expresses high levels of ERbeta, while the ERalpha is restricted to the proliferation compartment (basal cells). In high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), ERalpha gene expression extends to luminal cells and thus may mediate cancerogenic effects of estrogens on the dysplastic epithelium. Conversely, the ERbeta is downregulated in HGPIN indicating that the chemopreventive effects of phytoestrogens mediated by the ERbeta are partially lost. Irrespective of grades and stages, prostate cancer retains high levels of the ERbeta which is partially lost in androgen-insensitive stages of the disease. In contrast with breast cancer, the presence of the ERalpha and the PR is a late event in prostate cancer progression. At least 30% of metastatic and androgen-insensitive tumors express high levels of the PR indicating that these tumors harbor a functional ERalpha. The antiestrogen Raloxifene has growth-inhibitory effects on androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells in vitro and induces the apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. These data provide a rational for clinical trials to study the efficiency of antiestrogens in the medical treatment of advanced prostate cancer.","1847":"Prostate specific antigen is the most important tumor marker of prostate cancer. PSA, in conjunction with digital rectal examination, is the first-line clinical tool for detection of prostate cancer. To improve its specificity PSA-density, PSA-ratio (fPSA\/tPSA), PSA-velocity, and complexed PSA have been introduced into clinical praxis. The treatment of lower stage disease in younger men has resulted in a longer period of post-treatment cancer surveillance. Biochemical recurrence is an early indicator for clinical disease recurrence. PSA doubling time allows to distinguish between local and systemic progression and is also a valid predictor for distant metastasis and death of disease.","1848":"Prostate cancer offers a wide spectrum ranging from clinically insignificant to aggressive and fatal disease. The Gleason grade is a powerful prognostic indicator and does influence treatment decision. Educational programs and websites are currently available to improve reproducibility and reliability of Gleason grading. A major problem in reporting of Gleason grading in needle biopsy is undergrading. The Gleason grade 3 is the lowest grade which can be assigned reliably in needle biopsies. The major prognostic shift is between Gleason grades 3 und 4 which is characterized by fusion of the glandular formations. Reporting the proportion of Gleason grades 4 and 5 in needle biopsies may be critical in terms of treatment decisions. The present review deals with diagnostic criteria of the Gleason grades and its clinical implications.","1849":"Since several therapeutic options are currently available for clinically organ-confined prostate cancer, morphological parameters have rapidly emerged as prognostic factors to stratify patients into different therapeutic modalities. In addition to the PSA value, pathologic stage, as defined by the TNM system, Gleason grade and the surgical margin status, other markers have prognostic implications. This includes the percent pattern 4\/5 cancer, tumor volume, intraductal spread, large volume perineural invasion and molecular markers. This review discusses the methods of sampling and reporting in prostate pathology with an emphasis on well established and new prognostic factors.","1850":"Prostate cancer offers a wide range of growth patterns depicted in the classical Gleason diagram. For each Gleason pattern exist a number of benign and malignant mimickers that can simulate prostatic adenocarcinoma. In the present review, the use of immunohistochemical markers is discussed with emphasis to a pattern-based approach to differential diagnosis in prostate pathology. Basal cell markers (34betaE12 and P63) are very useful to analyze histo-architectural features of small and large glandular lesions. AMACR (P504 s) is helpful not only in identifying small amount of cancer in needle biopsies but also in the diagnosis of high grade prostatic intra epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). A number of lesions which may be confused with small acinar adenocarcinoma (Cowper's gland, nephrogenic metaplasia, mesonephric glands) and poorly differentiated prostate cancer (urothelial neoplasia, mucinous colon cancer and other metastatic lesions) lacks convincing PSA immunoreactivity. Basal cell markers and the nuclear androgen receptors are important markers to differentiate Gleason grade 5 A und 5 B patterns from prostatic involvement by transitional cell carcinoma. Finally, a selected panel of markers is useful to classify prostatic stromal lesions. In each case, immunohistochemical findings should be interpreted in context with the various patterns on routine microscopy.","1851":"Prostate cancer among adult males is the most common neoplasm in western countries. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is now a well established tumor marker that aids in the early detection of localized prostate cancer. Increased PSA concentrations are found in the serum of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or patients with prostate cancer, respectively. Therefore, in general the specificity of this test is low. The diagnostic value of PSA can be improved in consideration of clinical data, patients age, the measurement of free or complexed PSA, and the measurement of PSA velocity, respectively. Furthermore, there is a high variability between commercial PSA assays. Finally, the pre-analytical laboratory procedures have a high impact on the PSA measurement.","1852":"Neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation frequently occurs in common prostatic malignancies but usually escapes pathological and clinical detection. The present review focuses on biological properties of NE tumor cells making them resistant to androgen deprivation and radiation therapy. Recent data have shown that NE prostate cancer cells (as defined by the most commonly used endocrine marker chromogranin A) are arrested in the G0-phase of the cell cycle and do not undergo apoptosis. This particular phenotype consistently lacks the nuclear androgen receptor in both benign and malignant conditions but produces a series of hormonal growth factors exerting mitogenic stimuli on adjacent, exocrine tumor cells. Neoplastic NE cells devoid of the nuclear androgen receptor constitute an androgen-insensitive cell population in prostate cancer. The absence of proliferative and apoptotic activity makes NE tumor cells particularly resistant towards cytotoxic drugs and radiation therapy. Pathological and clinical detection of NE features is recommended for all prostate cancer patients for whom radiation therapy and androgen deprivation is being considered.","1853":"Punch biopsies have been taken from the prostate with increasing frequency in recent years, with a resulting increase in the number of diagnoses made. To check the diagnosis of \"small two- or three-gland carcinoma\" we prepared new H and E sections and, when the atypical glands were no longer available, also performed immunohistochemical analyses in 1,041 cases referred to our uropathology consultation service, comparing the diagnoses supplied by the referring doctors with the final diagnoses. In 61.6 of these cases histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate; the diagnosis recorded when the basal cell marker was absent and the tumour marker P504S was strongly expressed was atypical microglandular proliferation or suspected carcinoma. Previous diagnoses of prostatic carcinoma were confirmed in 99% of cases. In this way we also confirmed a further 27.9% of cases of prostate carcinoma in the grey area of diagnoses endorsed \"suggestive\" or \"suspected\". The patients concerned were thus spared multiple screening biopsies and were assigned for definitive treatment.","1854":"","1855":"Virtual microscopy has advanced considerably and is bound to be integrated into routine diagnostics in the very near future. Its integration into existing information systems builds up digital pathology. In this review, we present details, advantages and limitations of this novel technology and describe solutions regarding its adaptation to routine workflow. The chief aim is to define an uniform data format for virtual specimens to guarantee an interoperability between different systems. In the long term, digital archives and networks will be established that will allow for a worldwide access to virtual specimens.","1856":"Workers in the amber-processing industry are heavily exposed to amber dust during the cutting and grinding. Nothing is known about the effect on the lung of inhalation of amber dust. We studied the histological changes after subcutaneous injection of amber dust in man and the rat and after inhalation of amber dust in the rat. 1. The subcutaneous injection of amber dust led to acute inflammation and later to inflammation with large numbers of macrophages and giant cells, forming giant cell granulomas. 2. There was brisk phagocytosis of the amber dust by macrophages. Digestion of amber could not be identified with certainty. 3. Moderate inhalation of amber led to intraalveolar and intrabronchial phagocytosis, predominantly by macrophages. 4. After intense, repeated inhalation (4 and 6 1\/2 months post-inhalation) peribronchiolar foreign body granulomas and fibroblasts were seen. In contrast to the findings in the skin (probably related to grinding paste), no epithelioid cell granulomas were found in the lung. The tissue reactions in man are similar to those in the rat. The inflammatory and fibrotic interstitial reactions observed in the rat lung after prolonged intense exposure to amber dust suggest that chronic pulmonary damage (\"chronic amber lung\") could occur as a result of occupational exposure to amber dust during cutting\/polishing. ","1857":"NE tumor cells are present in virtually all prostatic adenocarcinomas. As they express no androgen receptor they are hormone independent. During anti-androgenic therapy their number increases. Their prognostic value is controversial. In 233 patients with prostatic carcinoma the NE differentiation was determined in a hot spot (7.9 mm(2)) with maximum CgA positive cell density. A high NE differentiation (HNE) was defined by a least 30 NE tumor cells, while less means a low NE differentiation (LNE). In addition the occurrence of NE tumor cells was defined as solitary or clustered (&gt; or =5 NE tumor cells in close proximity). In advanced and high grade tumors more and clustered NE tumor cells could be found than in low grade and organ confined tumors. Moreover HNE tumors and occurrence of NE clusters resulted in a significant shorter progression-free interval. Besides the quantity of NE differentiation the quality of the growth pattern of NE tumor cells is of relevance in prostatic carcinoma. ","1858":"Only recently fast-paced developments in computer technology allowed for the digitization of complete histologic slides. The resulting virtual slides may be viewed via webbrowser by any number of pathologists or students independent of time and location. Usage of a virtual microscope simply requires a computer workstation with a fast internet connection, which opens this technology to a broad public. A virtual microscopy system consists of three components: acquisition, server and client. Such systems are under development by different commercial and academic bodies worldwide. We have developed a virtual microscope system called vMic (http:\/\/www.vmic.unibas.ch) which provides virtual slides of very high image quality. Several successfully held online slide seminars and a histology course for students in dentistry are freely accessible in the internet. With the commercial availability of ultra rapid and easy-to-use slide scanners and the fast improvements of technology virtual microscopy will offer many applications in teaching, research and diagnostics. Thanks to additional functionalities, real microscopes will most likely be replaced by computer workstations in a couple of years.","1859":"Chromosome translocations in tumors frequently give rise to fusion genes encoding proteins with oncogenic activities. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC) are characterized by a t(11;19)(q21-22;p13) translocation found in approximately 60% of the tumors. This t(11;19) translocation results in a fusion gene consisting of exon 1 of the MECT 1 gene and exons 2-5 of the MAML 2 gene. As a result of the t(11;19) a fusion protein is generated which, independent of NOTCH-ligands, activates the transcription of the NOTCH target gene HES 1. The altered function of MAML 2 causes a disruption of NOTCH signalling which suggests a novel mechanism of tumorigenesis. Pending the elucidation of the t(11;19) at the molecular level of an apparently identical chromosomal translocation in Warthin's tumor, the identification of the translocation in MEC by FISH- and\/or RT-PCR-analyses may become important in diagnosis and might have prognostic relevance. Warthin's tumors are benign salivary gland neoplasms with a distinctive histomorphology and histogenesis completely different from MEC.","1860":"Systematic analysis of gene expression in salivary gland tumors is necessary to identify genes associated with specific tumor types. From the salivary gland register of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf sufficient samples of various tumors were available to generate Tissue Micro-Arrays (TMA). In light of the considerable heterogeneity of salivary gland tumors, this study was aimed at evaluating the suitability of TMA in salivary gland diagnostics and research. Epithelial antigens are not sufficient for a tumor-type-specific characterization. Myoepithelial markers are suitable for distinguishing biphasic tumor types from purely epithelial tumors. The detection of amylase in acinic cell carcinomas, and the detection of steroid hormone receptors in these and other malignant salivary gland tumors particularly in combination with the expression of transcription factors, oncogenes and proliferation associated antigens result in characteristic expression profiles. These may prove to be valuable for further investigations, especially on the molecular level.","1861":"Myoepithelial neoplasms of skin and soft tissues comprise cutaneous mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma), mixed tumor of subcutaneous and deep soft tissues, myoepithelioma and rare malignant myoepithelioma (myoepithelial carcinoma). Myoepithelial tumors of skin and soft tissues are characterized by an extreme clinicopathological heterogeneity as in other anatomic locations. The neoplasms arise in childhood as well as in adults and are composed of epithelioid, histiocytoid, spindled, plasmocytoid and\/or clear tumour cells in varying combinations, and are set in a myxoid or hyalinised intercellular matrix. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells stain positively for epithelial markers (pancytokeratin and\/or epithelial membrane antigen), and often for S 100 protein. More rarely muscle actin, glial fibrillary acid protein, calponin, and p63 are expressed, whereas desmin is usually negative. The presence of at least moderate cytological atypia is associated with a significant risk for aggressive behavior and propensity for metastasis.","1862":"This tutorial focuses on salivary duct carcinoma (SDC), a rare, high grade neoplasm mainly of major salivary glands. The clinical course of these tumors is characterised by extended local disease, early distant metastasis, and poor outcome. The morphology of SDC is reminiscent of breast ductal carcinomas and may occasionally cause diagnostic problems. In spite of mimicry with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast and an in situ component, that is evident in most tumors by immunohistology with antibodies directed against high molecular weight cytokeratins (Ck), SDC is always an invasive carcinoma. By immunohistology, most tumors show reactivity with antibodies directed against Ck 7, Ck 8\/18 and Ck 19 whereas a morphologically indistinguishable subgroup expresses Ck 5\/6 in tumor cells in addition to residual basal epithelia. Carcinoembryonic antigen, GCDFP-15 and androgen receptor are other helpful markers in routine diagnosis of SDC. Prostate-specific antigen is detectable in some cases. Abnormal p53 expression seems to indicate an adverse prognosis. Expression of c-erbB2, the over-expression of which is associated with a poor prognosis, may form the basis for a targeted therapeutic approach for selected cases of SDC.","1863":"The case of a soft tissue myoepithelioma is presented including clinicopathologic, ultrastructural, and genetic findings. A 30-year-old male patient suffered from a soft tissue tumor within the deep soft tissues of the right lower leg measuring 13.2 x 8.2 x 9 cm. Histologically, the lesion was diagnosed as a myoepithelioma displaying a lobulated architecture with cords and nests of epithelioid and spindle cells without cytologic atypia lying within a fibromyxoid and partly chondroid matrix; immunohistochemistry was positive for pancytokeratin, S100-protein, calponin and partly for GFAP and EMA. Ultrastructural analysis revealed glycogen deposits and cell-membrane-associated plaque structures, whereas true myofilaments could not be identified (with immunohistochemistry being negative for actin). Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a gain of chromosome Y was detected. A loss on 17p could not be detected unambiguously. However, based on the low resolution of CGH a small loss cannot be excluded. The patient was free of disease 25 months following complete tumor resection. Myoepitheliomas\/mixed tumors of deep soft tissue represent rare soft tissue lesions that may reach a considerable size and may mimic other soft tissue tumors or sarcomas. Based on a local relapse rate of approximately 20% according to the literature, a complete resection with thorough follow-up should be recommended.","1864":"This tutorial focuses on myoepithelial tumors of salivary glands, an entity with heterogeneous cytomorphology and inconsistent immunophenotype. Moreover, the clinical course cannot be predicted reliably from cytomorphological and immunophenotypic analysis. This heterogeneity causes problems in routine diagnostic, so that diagnosis ultimately rests on conventional histology. In a representative series of myoepitheliomas and malignant myoepitheliomas, antibodies against cytokeratins 5\/6, S 100 protein and vimentin produced the most consistent reactivity profile. Staining for cytokeratins 5\/6 is a useful addition to the established immunohistologic marker panel in the work-up of myoepitheliomas, because of its reliable expression in most cases and because it may underline the epithelial nature of the lesion. Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) profiles of myoepitheliomas and myoepithelial carcinomas showed no chromosomal aberration in less than 50% of myoepithelial carcinomas, so that CGH is of limited help in a given case. In a case that was represented in three separately localized manifestations of the disease that differed in their CGH profiles, gross genetic aberrations suggest to be acquired during tumor progression and should raise the suspicion of malignancy. Thus, diagnosis of myoepithelial tumors of salivary glands has to rest on morphological grounds with support of a restricted panel of immunohistologic markers.","1865":"Zygomycosis (Mucor- and Entomophtoramycosis) of the gastrointestinal tract is rare compared to other mycoses in the gastrointestinal area. The infection occurs mainly in immunosuppressed patients but rare cases concerning immunocompetent persons are also documented. Zygomycosis occurs in the gastrointestine primarily or due to disseminated disease. We report on a 48-year-old female alcohol-addicted patient who underwent gastric biopsies. The biopsy results showed invasive zygomycosis. Shortly thereafter, the patient died of sepsis. The second case presented here is a 15-year-old female patient with recurrent vomiting. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of duodenal biopsy specimens revealed fungi of the class Zygomycetes. In addition, histological and\/or microbiological examination demonstrated the presence of Candida in both cases.Zygomycosis of the gastrointestinal tract can have an aggressive course, making it important to know the morphological characteristics of the disease to facilitate early diagnosis and therapy. This is all the more important because the cultivation of fungi, as in our cases, is not always successful.","1866":"As we suppose that the knowledge of the prenatal development within the pelvic floor is necessary to understand the subdivision of the pelvic connective tissue we studied transparent sections through the untouched pelvis of fetuses and newborn. We compared them with those of adults and included modern imaging techniques. Our results show, that the classical concept concerning the subdivision of the pelvic connective tissue needs to be revised.","1867":"Specific types of the human papillomaviruses (high risk human papillomaviruses) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Although infections by these viruses are very common in the general population, only few result in clinically relevant lesions. Continuous and deregulated expression of two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 in basal or parabasal cells are required to induce and maintain neoplastic growth. In the course of an acute HPV-infection these genes are exclusively expressed in cell cycle arrested, terminally differentiated cells in the intermediate or superficial layers of the epithelium. Accidental activation of these genes in proliferating cells in the basal or parabasal cell layers results in interference with the cell cycle regulation, disturbances of the mitotic spindle apparatus and centrosome functions. This results in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations, chromosomal instability, increasing aneuploidy and initiates cervical carcinogenesis. The deregulated expression of the viral oncogene E7 is indicated by strong over-expression of the cellular p16(INK4a) gene product. This finding may have significant influence on novel strategies in cervical cancer diagnosis and screening. This review summarizes the basic molecular mechanisms of how papillomaviruses contribute to cellular transformation and how this can influence future diagnostic applications.","1868":"Abdominal radical hysterectomy (Wertheim operation) is the current standard of surgical therapy of cervical carcinoma. It is based on historical concepts of female pelvic anatomy and locoregional tumor spread. This surgical therapy - depending on the individual radicality of the operation - leads to damage of essential structures not involved by the tumor, e.g. the autonomic pelvic nerves. Despite of its supposed radicality the Wertheim operation has to be combined with adjuvant radiotherapy in case of histopathological high risk factors to reach acceptable rates of tumor control. The total mesometrial resection (TMMR) uses new insights in pelvic anatomy and local tumor spread derived from developmental biology for a new concept of radicality achieving a high regional control rate with minimal treatment-related morbidity without adjuvant radiotherapy.","1869":"The nodal status is one of the strongest prognostic factors in gynecologic malignancies. Metastatic involvement of regional and distant lymph nodes represents the selection basis for adjuvant therapy in a large number of solid neoplasms. The number of resected lymph nodes is one of the most important parameters in the quality control of the surgical procedure, in particular with respect to radicality. The present paper provides recommendations for gross dissection, laboratory procedures and reporting for lymph node biopsies, lymph node dissections and sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLN) for cancers of the vulva, vagina, uterine cervix, endometrium, Fallopian tubes and the ovaries, submitted for the evaluation of metastatic disease. The pathologic oncology report should include information about the number and size of resected lymph nodes, the number of involved lymph nodes with the maximum size of metastases and the presence of paranodal infiltration. In addition, the detection of isolated tumor cells should be reported, particularly with respect to the detection method (immunostains or molecular methods). In cases of metastatic disease and carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP-syndrome), information should be given regarding the primary tumor.","1870":"The introduction of a screening programme for carcinoma of the cervix uteri has lead to a reduction in the number of invasive carcinomas and to a relative increase in the frequency of preinvasive cervical lesions. The most frequent type of invasive cancer of the cervix is squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas are much more infrequent. Special subtypes of squamous cell carcinomas are the papillary (squamotransitional) subtype, the verrrucous subtype and the lymphoepithelioma-like subtype. Among the various forms of adenocarcinoma, the mucinous subtype is the most frequent, either as endocervical or interstinal subtype. Much more rare are the serous and clear cell carcinomas. Great concern in daily diagnosis causes the adenoma malignum (minimal deviation adenocarcinoma), since this type of adenocarcinoma demonstrates only minor cytological atypia and greatly resembles the different types of endocervical glandular hyperplasia.A report on a cervical carcinoma should always include the typing and grading of the tumor. Immunohistochemical stains are often useful to distinguish the various types of primary cervical cancer and to distinguish these from metastatic lesions.","1871":"Neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix are rare. They cover a wide age range occurring in young adult women and very old women. Two types are distinguished: small cell carcinoma (oat cell) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. They either occur in pure form or in combination with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. By immunohistochemistry, the expression of at least one neuroendocrine marker (chromogranin, synaptophysin, NSE) is a constant finding. PRb protein can not be detected, whereas the expression of p53 varies. Typically, there is an association with a high risk HPV infection. HPV 18 is found more often than HPV 16. The prognosis is still poor with early metastases to regional lymph nodes and distant sites such as lung, liver, bone, and brain.","1872":"Leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata (LPD) is a rare disease, which is most often found in women in reproductive age - seldom pre- and postmenaupausal. LPD has been described in women taking oral contraceptives or during pregnancy. LPD is mostly asymptomatic and discovered during operations like section caesarea, etc. Because of the macroscopic aspect (multiple small nodules &lt;2 cm) a metastasing tumour is suspected during operation. These nodules consist of smooth muscle fibres and show benign histologic features. An increased level of cases with similar endometriosis (10%), myoms of uterus or functional ovarian tumours have been reported. Few cases of malignant transformation have also been described. In the pathogenesis of LPD a metaplastic change of submesothelial multipotential mesenchymal cells as an abnormal response on hormonal stimulation is debated. A regression of LPD after delivery or after stopping oral contraceptives is possible. Another therapeutic option is the application of GnRH-agonists. We present a case of a 35-year old female patient with sudden abdominal pain and suspicious findings in abominal ultrasound and CT-abdomen. The intraoperative aspect shows diffuse intraabdominal nodules consisting of smooth muscle fibres and a cystic left ovary. LPD, endometriosis and a borderline lesion of the left ovary were diagnosed by intraoperative histological examination. A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy were performed.","1873":"","1874":"CT cannot provide useful information in a timely manner after neoadjuvant treatment. To evaluate the role of (18)F FDG PET after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for early therapy response and its effect on survival as compared to histopathologic tumor response, findings in 32 patients were analyzed prospectively in an ongoing multicenter trial (LUCAS-MD). histologically confirmed NSCLC stage IIIA\/IIIB. Neoadjuvant treatment: 2-3 cycles with paclitaxel\/carboplatin and a block of chemoradiation followed by surgery. Pretherapeutic staging: PET scan in addition to a spiral CT and\/or MRI. Second PET scan after completion of neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Documentation of lymph node involvement. Assessment of SUV and the metabolic tumor index for primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes. Image fusion of PET with CT data followed by molecular radiation treatment planning. Evaluation of histologic regression grade and correlation with PET for primary tumor and each lymph node location. All patients (10\/32) with complete response in lymph node metastases detected by PET prior to surgery, had no vital tumor cells (i.e. histologic regression grade\/RG III, sensitivity 100%). In primary tumors showing complete response, the RG was IIb or III, in one patient IIa (false negative in PET). False positive findings in PET are due to inflammation (5 patients, histologically confirmed). Univariate analyses: actuarial tumor-specific survival for complete metabolic remission vs. incomplete remission after 24 months: 76 vs. 20% (p=0,0079); for RG III\/IIb vs. RG IIa\/I after 24 months: 63 vs. 36% (p=0,0123).(18)F FDG PET precedes CT in measuring the tumor response and may predict (long term) therapeutic outcome in stage III NSCLC. Histologic regression grade correlates well with metabolic remission as detected by PET. ","1875":"The Infectious Disease Control Act enacted in Germany in 1.1.2001 led to a duty of notification also for institutes of pathologic-anatomical diagnostics. All reports within 45 months after enacting concerning diseases and agents being subject to registration were evaluated. Among the notifiable diseases with fatal outcome ( section sign 6) belonged 3 cases of Meningococcus sepsis, 13 of tuberculosis und 5 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. During lifetime 54% of tuberculosis cases remained undetected. Notifiable agents ( section sign 7.1) concerned 92 times Mycobacterium-tuberculosis-complex, twice Influenza Virus and one case of Cryptosporidiosis and Giardia lamblia each. Six Echinococcus granulosus cysts were reported ( section sign 7.2). Notification needs exact diagnosis of infectious diseases and agents being subject of registration. By this pathologists participate in the control of infectious diseases.","1876":"High dosage regional chemotherapy, chemoembolization and other methods of regional treatment are commonly used to treat unresectable primary liver malignancies and liver metastases. In liver malignancies of childhood neoadjuvant chemotherapy is successfully combined with surgical treatment. Chemotherapy and local tumor ablation lead to characteristic histomorphologic changes: Complete destruction of the tumor tissue and its vascular bed is followed by encapsulated necroses. After selective eradication of the tumor cells under preservation of the fibrovasular bed the tumor is replaced by hypocellular edematous and fibrotic tissue. If completely damaged tumor tissue is absorbed quickly, the tumor area is replaced by regenerating liver tissue. Obliterating fibrohyalinosis of tumor vessels, and perivascular edema or necrosis indicate tissue damage along the vascular bed. Degenerative pleomorphism of tumor cells, steatosis, hydropic swelling and Malloryhyalin in HCC can represent cytologic findings of cytotoxic cellular damage. Macroscopic type of HCC influences significantly the response to treatment. Multinodular HCC often contain viable tumor nodules close to destroyed nodules after treatment. Encapsulated uninodular tumors undergo complete necrosis much easier. Large size and a tumor capsule limitate the effect of percutaneous injection of ethanol into HCC. In carcinomas with an infiltrating border, especially in metastases of adenocarcinomas and hepatic cholangiocarcinoma cytostatic treatment damages the tumor tissue mainly in the periphery. Nevertheless the infiltrating rim, portal veins, lymphatic spaces and bile ducts as well as the angle between liver capsule, tumor nodule and bordering parenchyma are the main refugees of viable tumor tissue even after high dosage regional chemotherapy. This local resistance is caused by special local conditions of vascularization and perfusion. These residues are the source of local tumor progression and distant metastases. Besides intrinsic cellular mechanisms architectural, and microenvironmental factors relevantly limitate the effect of intensive locoregional therapy.","1877":"Clear cell tumors of the lung are rare tumors composed of epithelioid HMB45 positive tumor cells. It has been proposed that clear cell tumors generate from perivascular epithelioid cells which are also found in renal angiomyolipoma. Due to its morphologic epithelioid features with clear cytoplasm the distinction from either primary or metastatic clear cell carcinoma is difficult. Usually clinical investigations do not lead to the final diagnosis so that only subsequent histological examination and immunophenotyping can establish the correct tumor classification. We describe the case of a 52 year old woman who underwent exploratory thoracotomy because of a lung mass in the right lower lobe. In frozen sections a solid trabecular tumor was diagnosed, paraffin histology and immunohistochemistry revealed a clear cell tumor of the lung. The difficulty of the correct diagnosis of the clear cell tumor of the lung in frozen sections is discussed as well as the differential diagnosis.","1878":"Aspects of histogenesis and nomenclature of so called \"sclerosing hemangioma\" of the lung (WHO 1999) are discussed and compared with immunohistochemical findings in eight examined operation specimen. The lesion is characterised by the presence of typical surface cells, which can be related to type II pneumocytes. Progesterone-receptor positive stromal cells may derive from primitive mesenchymal cells. Endothelial proveniance of tumor cells could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, this rare usually benign pulmonary neoplasm should be entitled \"pneumocytoma\" analogous to the suggestion of several other authors.","1879":"The moleculargenetic detection of specific genetic abnormalities within malignant hematopoietic disorders is an important diagnostic tool with relevance for the differential diagnosis, therapy and prognosis.According to a modified and optimized RT-PCR based technique native bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples of 183 patients were investigated for the presence of specific genetic abnormalities. The histological diagnosis of all CMLs t(9;22) and variants of AMLs M3 t(15;17) and t(11;17) were moleculargenetically confirmed. Additionally one t(5;12) positive chronic myelomonozytic leukemia, one t(8;21) positive AML M1, one t(9;22) positive B-ALL and in each case one t(6;9) and one t(3;21) positive myelodysplastic syndrome were detected. The hereby described method is a simple, specific and reliable technique for the rapid moleculargenetic detection of specific genetic abnormalities within malignant hematopoietic disorders with implication for the diagnosis\/differential diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.","1880":"The entity and nosology of pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is still ambiguous. The actual WHO-Classification uses pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and pleomorphic sarcoma NOS (not otherwise specified) synonymously. On the other hand text and illustrations convey the impression, that these tumors also could be pleomorphic lipo-, leio- or rhabdomyosarcomas etc. It would have been more informative to emphasize, that with the above mentioned specific sarcoma types MFH-like appearance may occur. Furthermore it would have been more up to date to consider pleomorphic sarcomas NOS as pleomorphic fibrosarcomas and include them in the chapter of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors. This concept already has been carried out for the former myxoid variant of MFH, nowadays preferentially called myxofibrosarcoma. There is controversial discussion about the clinical significance of exact typing of pleomorphic sarcomas. Problems may also occur due to the lack of standards, which degree of desmin expression signifies leiomyosarcoma or just indicates myofibroblasts in MFH. The requirement of exclusion of other tumor-types before diagnosing pleomorphic fibrosarcoma still remains obligatory. After verification of the diagnosis pleomorphic sarcoma NOS or pleomorphic fibrosarcoma, grading e.g. according to criteria of the FFCCS can be carried out. Most cases of pleomorphic fibrosarcoma will qualify as high grade malignant.","1881":"Histological grading according to one of the proven systems, e.g. that of the FFCCS, leads to the definition of different prognostic risk groups. Prerequisite is a precise typing of the tumors, if necessary by immunohistochemical and molecular-pathological methods. The therapeutic decision is dependent on the presence either of a low- or high-grade malignant tumor: With low-grade sarcomas surgery has priority, with high grade tumors usually chemo- and\/or radiotherapy are indicated. With the latter, also better therapeutic response is reported. Therefore, conversion of a 3-grade into a 2-grade system has to be carried out by including the tumor localization as prognostic parameter. Thereby, the large group of G2-sarcomas with intermediate malignancy can be stratified. Superficial G2-sarcomas are considered to be low grade and deep G2-sarcomas high grade malignant. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor cell nuclei with Ki67\/MIB1 allows a more standardized and precise grading. The ultimate aim, not to define risk groups, but to predict the prognosis for individual patients, possibly could be reached someday by molecular diagnostic methods.","1882":"We report on an unusual locally recurrent plantar soft tissue sarcoma in a 7-years-old boy. Due to an unusual morphology a clear diagnosis was initially not possible. The histologically different recurrent tumor was classified as synovial sarcoma by means of immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural and molecular analysis. This case demonstrates the variable morphological appearance of synovial sarcoma and the value of modern diagnostic procedures in such circumstances.","1883":"Synovial sarcoma diagnosis and differential diagnostic distinction from other spindle cell sarcomas may be difficult. In these cases the detection of the t(X;18) translocation by FISH and RT-PCR is diagnostically extremely helpful. This study was aimed at the question whether or not simultaneous use of both methods is required for evidence of t(X;18) translocation.Paraffin-embedded tumour specimens from 53 patients were included in the study which were considered to be possible synovial sarcomas on the basis of histological aspect and immunohistochemical profile. Detection of t(X;18) was performed using FISH and RT-PCR simultaneously. Nuclei and amplifiable RNA could be isolated from 39 of the 53 included cases (75%). In 72% of these 39 cases FISH and RT-PCR showed identical negative or positive results. The remainder of the cases (28%) showed either a typical PCR product or a positive FISH signal.In conclusions FISH could be confirmed by typical PCR products and is therefore qualified as an internal quality control. Nevertheless tumour biological and methodical reasons have an important influence on both methods. Consequently in difficult cases simultaneous FISH and RT-PCR analysis is necessary for a clear evidence of t(X;18) translocation.","1884":"Sinonasal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are infrequent neoplasms. 16 cases of low-malignant MPNST in this localization were retrieved from the files of soft tissue tumors established in Jena. They were examined with regard to their morphology and immunohistochemistry. The importance of an only partial immunostaining by S100 protein antibodies for diagnosis and differential diagnostic discrimination to benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas and neurofibromas) is explained. Finally, the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors in the sinonasal region in general is briefly discussed.","1885":"Morphological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical findings of 12 diffuse type-tenosynovial giant cell tumors\/pigmented villonodular synovitis are presented compared to 30 localized tenosynovial giant cell tumors (giant cell tumor of tendon sheath). Diffuse-type-tenosynovial giant cell tumor is characterized by a striking vascularisation pattern composed of densely arranged thin-walled, partly slit-like and partly hyalinized small blood vessels within the papillary synovial fronds. These vessels may show abnormal structures with incompletely arranged endothelial cells\/pericytes. The fibrohistiocytic tumor cells probably cause considerable compression\/distortion or destruction of the small vessels which might be responsible for an increased blood deposition and massive hemosiderosis. Accompanying multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells seemingly are recruited from circulating blood monocytes. Microhemorrhagic foci with multinucleated giant cells could be detected in 83% of diffuse-type and 67% of localized-type tumors. Apart from the described vessels, typical morphological findings in diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumors included \"giant\" hemosiderotic granules, (at least 2-3 times the diameter of an erythrocyte) \"giant\" siderophages, pseudoalveolar clefts and irregularly anastomosing synovial fronds. Neither mitotic rate nor the amount of giant cells\/amount of nuclei of giant cells revealed statistically significant differences between localized-type and diffuse-type of tenosynovial giant cell tumor. Immunohistochemically, the diffuse-type exhibited focal expression of CD31 (in 75% of tumors) and calretinin (in 63%) besides CD68-staining.","1886":"Desmoid-type fibromatoses (aggressive fibromatoses) represent infiltrative, locally destructively growing soft tissue tumors with a high potential for recurrence. Desmoid tumors of 33 adult patients were analysed regarding clinical and morphological aspects (sex, age distribution, site, size, mitotic rate, tumor microvessel density, surgical margins, additional radiotherapy). Possible statistical correlations were examined using log-rank-tests. No prognostic significance of tumor microvessel density was evident. A correlation between mitotic index (1 or more mitoses per 50 high power fields) and local relapse rate was notably striking, but not statistically significant (log-rank: 0.17). Additional postoperatively applied radiotherapy proved to be statistically significant to avoid local recurrences (log-rank: 0.01). The presented results may indicate an increased risk for local relapse in those desmoid-type fibromatoses which are mitotically active. Postoperative radiotherapy seems to be effective in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis to avoid tumor recurrence. Differential diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis\/aggressive fibromatosis in adulthood include various fibroblastic\/myofibroblastic soft tissue tumors such as nodular fasciitis, fibrosarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma as well as leiomyosarcoma and soft tissue leiomyoma.","1887":"Perivascular neoplasms of skin and soft tissues comprise a group of benign and malignant mesenchymal neoplasms showing a perivascular myogenic differentiation. Whereas glomus tumour including its variants represents a clearly defined clinicopathological entity, the whole concept of haemangiopericytoma has been questioned in the last years, and no clear diagnostic criteria are established at the moment. Myopericytomas and myofibromas represent a morphological spectrum of perivascular spindle-shaped lesions. Infantile myofibroma\/infantile myofibromatosis and solitary myofibroma of adults are characterized by a biphasic growth of mature, spindled, myofibroblastic cells and smaller, immature, mesenchymal cells associated with numerous haemangiopericytoma-like vessels. Benign and rare malignant myopericytomas of skin and soft tissues are characterized by a concentric, perivascular growth of plump spindled and round tumour cells staining positively for muscle actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin and more rarely for desmin. PEComas represent an enigmatic family of neoplasms composed of perivascular epithelioid, clear, and spindled tumour cells characterized by a coexpression of melanocytic and myogenic markers.","1888":"This case describes the history of disease of a 53-year old man, who has been treated for a putative recurrent nailbed granuloma of the right big toe since 1996. In 2000 an enlarged inguinal lymph node was excised. The light microscopic examination showed a metastasis of a malignant melanoma. In 2003 we received a tumor of the right big toe for histopathological examination. The histological and immunohistochemical results proved a dermal chondroid melanoma. This extremely rare variant of malignant melanoma occurs particularly in subungual location and is possibly related to a previous trauma. We discuss the spectrum of differential diagnoses and the importance of immunohistochemistry.","1889":"Primary sarcomas of the great vessels are rare. Their most common site is the inferior vena cava. We report a primary leiomyosarcoma of a 41 year old female patient localised just below the right renal vein. The resected tumour showed the histological signs of a well differentiated, progesterone positive leiomyosarcoma. The case is discussed on the data of the reviewed literature.","1890":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the most frequent malignant pancreatic tumor. It is one of the tumors that has a particularly poor prognosis. Its morphological characteristics are: preferential localization in the head of the pancreas, ductal-glandular tumor structures combined with marked desmoplasia and CEA and MUC1 positivity. Variants of this carcinoma include adenosquamous carcinomas, undifferentiated pleomorphic carcinomas and mixed ductal-endocrine tumors. With the definition of ductal lesions as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a progression model for pancreatic ductal carcinoma has been developed and corresponding gene alterations have been detected.","1891":"Pancreatic biopsy is an invasive diagnostic method that is only performed when all other diagnostic measures for establishing the diagnosis of a tumorous lesion of the pancreas have failed. Because of the advances in modern imaging techniques, fine needle biopsy of the pancreas guided by ultrasonography, computer tomography or endosonography has become a reliable method that allows the diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma or any of the other, rarer pancreatic tumors with high sensitivity and specificity. Complications are rare, particularly with the endosonographically guided biopsy. A new biopsy indication is the demonstration of certain markers or gene mutations that are needed for the initiation of special treatments, e.g. EGFR-Cetuximab.","1892":"Cystic tumors and tumor-like lesions of the pancreas are rare, but have attracted a great deal of attention because they are easily recognized with new imaging methods and, in contrast to ductal adenocarcinoma, they can usually be cured surgically. The increasing resection rate in recent years has also increased our knowledge of cystic pancreatic tumors by conspicuously enlarging their morphological spectrum. Known entities have been better characterized (i.e. solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm) and new ones described (serous oligocystic adenoma, mucinous non-neoplastic cyst, acinar cell cystadenoma and cystic hamartoma). This review discusses the most important cystic tumors and tumor-like lesions, presents a new classification, and summarizes the immunohistochemical differential diagnosis.","1893":"Acinar cell carcinomas and pancreatoblastomas are malignant tumors of the pancreas, showing predominantly acinar differentiation characterized by the immunohistochemical expression of pancreatic enzymes. Histologically, they usually display acinar and\/or solid patterns, but may occasionally also exhibit cystic structures. The key feature of pancreatoblastomas is the presence of squamoid corpuscles. Acinar cell carcinomas predominantly occur in adults, pancreatoblastomas in children. Both tumor types commonly show allelic losses on chromosome 11p and mutations in the APC\/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Pancreatoblastomas, in contrast to acinar cell carcinomas, are potentially curable.","1894":"Mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas are rare. They are resected because a solid or cystic pancreatic tumor is suspected. Benign mesenchymal tumors comprise lymphangiomas, hemangiomas, schwannomas, solitary fibrous tumors, adenomatoid tumors, clear cell tumors, and hamartomas. Inflammatory pseudotumors are a special case. Malignant mesenchymal tumors include leiomyosarcomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), liposarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, Ewing's sarcomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). It is important to differentiate these tumors from anaplastic carcinomas and retroperitoneal tumors that infiltrate pancreatic tissue.","1895":"The most important of the generally rare intraductal tumors of the pancreas is the intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). In recent years this tumor type has been described in detail, and it was included in the WHO classification of 1996. IPMNs typically grow for a long time within the ducts, before approximately 50% of them eventually become invasive. Because of this feature the IPMNs are clearly distinct from ductal adenocarcinomas. Currently, IPMNs have advanced to the most commonly resected cystic tumor of the pancreas. Recent studies have shown that IPMNs may be distinguished into different types showing a different biology according to their mucin pattern.","1896":"Undifferentiated pancreatic carcinomas are rare anaplastic variants of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. They have to be distinguished immunohistochemically from metastases of malignant melanoma or an infiltrating sarcoma. An uncommon variant is undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells. This variant can be associated with mucinous cystic neoplasms and is characterized by abundant non-neoplastic osteoclast-like giant cells.","1897":"The neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are rare, but belong to the most common endocrine neoplasms of the abdomen. In most cases they present as solitary tumors, composed of monomorphic cells. Functionally active cells are associated with characteristic hormonal syndromes. Using morphological, immunohistochemical and biological criteria, the classification distinguishes between well differentiated tumors with benign or uncertain behavior, well differentiated (low grade malignant) carcinomas and poorly differentiated (high grade malignant) carcinomas. In recent years the percentage of non-functional tumors has increased.","1898":"Chronic pancreatitis is a fibroinflammatory disease that is induced by injuries to the interstitial, ductal, and\/or acinar cells. The most important causes are alcohol abuse, gene mutations, autoimmune processes, special anatomic changes, and obstructive duct lesions. The morphologic spectrum of the various types of chronic pancreatitis related to the above causes shows features that increasingly allow an etiological distinction and categorization to be made. A catalog of five criteria is presented for distinguishing chronic pancreatitis from ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","1899":"Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas represent a special tumor entity, both morphologically and biologically. They form large solitary tumors that occur predominantly in young women. Histologically, they show solid, pseudopapillary, and pseudocystic patterns. The tumor cells are monomorphous and typically express vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, nuclear beta-catenin, and the progesterone receptor. Complete resection cures the tumor in about 90% of the cases. However, because recurrences and even metastases may occur in a small number of cases, SPN are classified as low-grade malignant tumors. Predicting malignancy histologically is not yet possible. The most important differential diagnosis to consider is neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. The etiology and pathogenesis of SPN are obscure.","1900":null,"1901":"Today the treatment of gonadal germ cell tumors is standardized. The cisplatin containing chemotherapy and the multi-modal therapy strategies have increased the rate of successful treatment enormously. Germ cell tumors are almost always treated surgically. Following the rare, primary chemotherapy, the residual tumor must be classified according to the WHO as accurately as possible. A binding system for the documentation of tumor regression does not exist. The diagnostic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is also rare. Here as well, the classification is performed according to the WHO and the TNM classification. The examination of the tissue samples from a retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy after chemotherapy is problematic. The morphology is often bizarre, preparatory and terminological standards do not exist. Is there still vital tumor present then it can most often be diagnosed as a teratoma. In that case a classification takes place as to whether it is \"mature\" or \"immature\". If a tissue sample contains other differentiations, the classification is performed in detail according to the WHO classification of germ cell tumors. Sarcomas or carcinomas must be reliably distinguished and classified, as they lead to different therapeutic consequences. The terminology must be defined in a binding manner between both the pathology and the clinic, due to the lack of global definitions.","1902":"Parkinson's disease is a continuously progressive degenerative disorder of the central, peripheral and enteric human nervous systems. Not only the substantia nigra, but also a number of other components of the motor and limbic systems, as well as the autonomic regulation, suffer heavy damages. Only a few of the many types of nerve cells in the human central nervous system develop the characteristic Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. They are composed primarily of aggregated alpha-synuclein and lead to the premature destruction of the affected neurons. Due to the selective neuronal vulnerability, a distinctive distribution of changes occurs within the central nervous system, leading to a corresponding loss of functionality in many systems. The changes occur in an ordered timely fashion. The ascending pathological process begins within the brain at the glossopharyngeal and vagal areas, nearly destroys the substantia nigra, and reaches the mesocortex of the gray matter. From here it expands to further areas of the neocortex, thereby marking the end phase of the disease.","1903":"This case report deals with an, in our regions, unusual diagnosis of coincidence of a genital schistosomiasis of a 30-year-old woman, coming from Africa. The female patient presented herself by a specialist because of longer lasting hypermenorrhoe. After clinical examination the patient underwent an operation because of an uterus myomatosus. The histopathological evaluation showed beside a leimyoma an expanded infestation with schistosomiasis haematobium. After pathological diagnosis the patient underwent the standard therapy with a single injection of praziquantel. We report about the clinic, epidemiology, morphology and diagnostic.","1904":"","1905":"The principles of modern forensic DNA-analysis using the amplification of so called STR-polymorphisms are explained. Four cases from practise that required the collaboration of forensic molecular biology and pathology and which were analysed by them are presented and discussed. Similarities and variations in the work of both \"disciplines\" are presented and suggestions for the storage of samples formulated.","1906":"Morphological findings of 21 soft tissue sarcomas of adulthood following preoperative chemo- and\/or radiotherapy including perfusion therapy and resection are presented. The therapy-induced changes included a spectrum ranging from total tumor regression up to still completely vital tumor (median of all cases: 30% vital tumor tissue). 7 of 21 sarcomas (33%) were evaluated as responders (grade I-III). So-called malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) revealed a good tumor response to preoperatively administered therapy (regression grades I and II). Myxoid\/round-cell liposarcoma exhibited regression grades of IV-V (i.e. 30% up to 95% vital tumor tissue, non-responders). Synovial sarcoma was characterized by regression grades III up to VI (i.e. up to 100% vital tumor tissue without any signs of regression, 83% non-responders). Completely vital tumor was evident in 2 synovial sarcomas despite preoperative tumor therapy. These findings hint towards differences in response of distinct sarcoma entities to preoperative chemo-\/radiotherapy. A grading of therapy-induced tumor regression in adult soft tissue sarcomas may best refer to already established grading schemes (e.g. according to the grading scheme for osteosarcomas following chemotherapy of Salzer-Kuntschik). A report of sarcoma resection specimens should include the percentage of vital tumor tissue.","1907":"Adenocarcinoids are rare tumors with histological features of both carcinoid tumor and adenocarcinoma. They show a more aggressive biological behaviour than conventional carcinoids. We report a case of a 64-years-old female patient with a diffuse infiltration of the appendicular wall by an adenocarcinoid. Due to the positive surgical margin and the tumor expansion a hemicolectomy was performed. There are no precise criteria to direct the operative choice between appendectomy and hemicolectomy. It is thought that appendectomy is sufficient in case of small tumors in the tip of the appendix. Patients with diffuse appendicular involvement require a more aggressive surgical therapy.","1908":"Especially patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, but also patients with small cell lung cancer without distant metastases are increasingly treated by means of neoadjuvant multimodality therapy. In corresponding resection specimens of primary tumours and lymph nodes, the extent of therapy-induced tumour regression represents an independent prognostic factor. After neoadjuvant therapy, different-sized target-like foci with central necrosis, adjoining narrow foam cell rim, peripheral vascular granulation tissue and transition into a marked scarry fibrosis can be established in the former tumour area. Morphological changes indicating therapy-induced tumour regression can be graded according to the \"Bochum regression grading\" system. Cytomorphological changes do not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn about the success of the applied neoadjuvant therapy. In resection specimens, they should not form the basis of a cytopathologic grading or lead to the diagnosis of \"large cell anaplastic carcinoma\".","1909":"","1910":"Alzheimer's disease is a slowly but continuously progressive degenerative disorder of the human central nervous system seen in approximately 15% of elderly people over the age of 65 years. Morphological hallmarks of this process are intra- and extracellular protein aggregates. The intraneuronal protein aggregates are primarily made up of abnormal phosphorylated tau-protein, which builds neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites in neuritic plaques. The extracellular deposits consist of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregates showing the characteristics of amyloid fibrils. The evolution of neurofibrillary changes as well as Abeta-deposition in brain regions follows a distinct hierarchical sequence spanning many decades. Abeta deposition begins in the neocortex whereas neurofibrillary pathology starts in the allocortical nerve cells of the transentorhinal region. Both transformations continue to increase in severity and expand into further areas and regions. The hierarchical pattern allows an easily understandable staging of neurofibrillary and Abeta pathology which in turn reflects the clinical gravity of the disease. According to these stages a dementing disorder can be diagnostically attributed to Alzheimer's disease.","1911":"Molecular methods can complement the classical methods in pathology like macroscopic, histological and immunohistochemical examinations.Comparative genomic hybridization is a cytogenetic method to screen for gains and losses of chromosomal material in tumor cells. This method allows defect studies of archival paraffin-embedded and formalin-fixed tumor material. CGH can detect gains and losses of chromosomal material that are at least 10 to 20 megabases in size. This genome-wide screening method allows to study the cytogenetic relationship between differently located tumors of a patient. To answer the question if these different tumors are metastases of the primary lung tumor or independent primary tumors CGH analysis is a supplementary method that introduces new prospectives.","1912":"The correct use of tumor classifications is one of the key elements of adequate oncological treatment. Tumor classifications comprise: localization, typing, grading staging and stage grouping, classification after neoadjuvant radio(chemo)therapy, TNM classification and R classification. For easier identification and better documentation it is advisable to have a summary of tumor classifications at the end of each tumor concerning pathology report. Experience in clinical use has shown that classification may be incomplete or inadequately used. Not infrequently they are reported in a way which is open for misinterpretation. Some possible mistakes and misuse of tumor classifications are discussed. Users, among which are clinicians and pathologists, have to bear in mind the limitations of tumor classifications. These are for example reflected by the difficulty to classify single tumor entities in a correct way.","1913":"Adrenal cysts are uncommon lesions and most of them are found incidentally during abdominal imaging. We report on two benign extraadrenal lesions mimicking adrenal tumors in abdominal imaging. The histopathological investigation of the lesions revealed a foregut duplication cyst of the lesser gastric curvature and an epithelial inclusion cyst (epidermoid cyst) in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen respectively.","1914":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been extended to earlier stages of breast carcinoma in order to increase the rate of breast conservation by downstaging. Tumour regression can be observed in up to 80% of the cases and the chemosensitivity of the individual tumour can be studied in vivo. Moreover therapy induced regression has been established as an independent prognostic parameter. Characteristic effects of chemotherapy include reduction in cell number, fibrosis, vacuolization of cytoplasm and increased nuclear pleomorphism. Grading, typing and immunohistochemical properties of the carcinomas remain unchanged in the majority of cases. Predictive for the chemosensitivity of tumours are a high nuclear grade, overexpression of Her-2-neu, lack of estrogen receptor expression and lymph node metastases.","1915":"High-grade central osteosarcomas are the most frequent malignant bone neoplasms in childhood and adolescence. Their prognosis has been substantially improved using neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The morphological examination of surgical specimens reveals important information regarding the success of treatment. The histological determined degree of regression represents one of the most reliable therapy-related prognostical factor. Thus pathological analysis of the surgical specimens is of great importance notwithstanding the improved clinical and radiological diagnostic of osteosarcoma.","1916":"Malignant tumors of the maxilla are rare. In addition to primary tumors metastatic disease has to be considered. Renal cell carcinomas, carcinomas of the breast, lung and adenocarcinomas are constituting the most frequent primary lesions for maxillary metastases. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of a mucinous sweat gland carcinoma metastasizing to the maxilla four years after primary diagnosis. Thirty-two months after resecting the hemimaxilla, there are no signs of local recurrence. Although skin tumors only rarely develop distant metastases, sweat gland carcinomas should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumors metastasizing to the maxilla.","1917":"","1918":"After 10 years, loosening of total joint endoprostheses occurs in about 3 to 10 percent of all patients, requiring elaborate revision surgery. A periprosthetic membrane is routinely found between bone and loosened prosthesis. Further histomorphological examination allows determination of the etiology of the loosening process. Aim of this study is the introduction of clearly defined histopathological criteria for a standardized evaluation of the periprosthetic membrane. Based on histomorphological criteria and polarized light microscopy, four types of the periprosthetic membrane were defined: periprosthetic membrane of wear particle type (type I), periprosthetic membrane of infectious type (type II), periprosthetic membrane of combined type (type III), periprosthetic membrane of indifferent type (type IV). Periprosthetic membranes of 268 patients were analyzed according to the defined criteria. The correlation between histopathological and microbiological diagnosis was high (89%, p&lt;0,001), the inter-observer reproducibility was sufficient (95%). This classification system enables a standardized diagnostic procedure and therefore is a basis for further studies concerning the etiology of and pathogenesis of prosthesis loosening.","1919":"We report on three autopsy cases with clinical and morphological evidence of pulmonary hypertension and concurrent myeloproliferative disorders. Massive accumulations of pleomorphic, atypical megakaryocytes and thrombotic material are found within the pulmonary capillary beds. Morphometrical studies allowed us to identify on average 1,293.4 (1,145.8-1,401) megakaryocytes per one square centimetre lung tissue (standard value: 25 megakaryocytes\/cm(2) lung tissue). The lungs of the controls with unaffected parenchyma show smaller numbers of megakaryocytes. It seems highly unlikely that these haematopoietic cells originate in lung capillaries in the absence of morphological correlates. Recurrent chronic microemboli consisting of megakaryocytes and thrombocytes could be held responsible for the development of secondary chronic pulmonary hypertension. Our observations suggest that pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic myeloproliferative disorders should be classified into the fourth group of the EVIAN-classification of pulmonary hypertension.","1920":"Pulmonary alveolar proteinoses are rare pulmonary diseases characterised by an intraalveolar accumulation of surfactant protein A. Subtyping of alveolar proteinoses: Type I alveolar proteinoses: severe respiratory insufficiency in newborns, which will take a lethal course without lung transplant; hereditary SP-B deficiency and an intraalveolar accumulation of N-terminal incompletely processed SP-C. Type II alveolar proteinoses: occur in newborns and infants; often take a lethal course; show intraalveolar accumulation of precursors of SP-B and mature SP-B as well as an accompanying interstitial lung disease of variable severity. Type III alveolar proteinoses: in infants and children; do not generally take a lethal course; they are characterised by an intraalveolar accumulation of precursors of SP-B and mature SP-B without accompanying interstitial lung disease. \"Cryptogenic\" congenital, acquired (idiopathic), and secondary type III alveolar proteinoses can be distinguished. In newborns, infants, and children with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a detailed pathological-anatomical examination including immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses, should be performed in order to optimise the therapeutical management.","1921":"Regressive changes following pretreatment of prostate cancer may represent a big challenge for the histopathologist not familiar with the assessment of pretreated specimens. Characteristic changes after antiandrogen therapy in non-malignant prostate tissue include glandular atrophy, basal cell prominence and\/or basal cell hyperplasia as well as a hypercellular stroma. Morphologic changes in prostate cancer include cytoplasmic clearing and vacuolization, nuclear pyknosis and even complete cell destruction. On the glandular level, changes are characterized by various degrees of involutional changes, ranging from almost non-regressive tumor glands to complete glandular disruption with scattered isolated tumor cells dispersed in the stroma. Knowledge about these changes, the selective use of immunohistochemistry as well as a very thorough histological workup is essential for the correct assessment of these specimens.","1922":"Malignant mesotheliomas are rare tumors which can affect pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis testis. Histomorphologically, predominant epitheloid, sarcomatoid and biphasic types can be distinguished. In some cases, leucocytic infiltrations can be observed adjacent to the tumor. Here, mesotheliomas presenting inflammatory reactions to tumor growth have to be differentiated from occasional cases with parasynchronic development of neoplastic lymphatic diseases. Moreover, so called lymphohistiocytoid mesotheliomas, a sporadically observed variant of malignant mesotheliomas, have been reported to imitate inflammatory patterns. These different forms of malignant mesotheliomas are difficult to distinguish and may lead to diagnostic misinterpretations and consequently therapeutic mismanagement. The purpose of this study was to differentiate morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the above mentioned diagnoses. We therefore studied two rare cases, a mesothelioma with parallel lymphoma and a lymphohistiocytoid mesothelioma, and compared them to a third more common case of mesothelioma with inflammatory tissue-reaction.","1923":"Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) represents a wide range of clinical and pathological distinct entities. The villous forms of GTD includes developmental disorders of the placental tree, like blighted ovum, embryonal, partial and complete moles. The risk of persistent GTD is estimated of 2-14% in partial and up to 50% in complete moles. So, the morphologic differentiation between the different entities of villous forms of GTD is clinical very important. Sometimes, early forms of complete moles (up to 12th weeks of gestation) may represent diagnostic problems, even in the diagnosis of regressive alterations of the placental villous tree after intrauterine retention.","1924":"","1925":"The non-villous forms of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) include a wide range of morphologic different lesions and cover a wide range of differential diagnosis. Choriocarcinomas (CCA) represent the most malignant form displaying a dimorphic pattern with proliferation of syncytio- and zytotrophoblast. An early start of chemotherapy is of great prognostic impact. Placental site nodule (PSN) and exaggerated placental site (EPS) are non-neoplastic lesions of the intermediate trophoblast without tumorous appearance, whereas placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and epitheloid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) represent tumorous neoplasms with a potential for local invasion and metastases. PSNs are incidental findings of highly polymorphic cells. In EPS chorionic villi are almost present, endometrial glands and spiral arteries are completely engulfed by intermediate trophoblastic cells without necroses. In PSTT the monomorphic, occasional multinucleated giant cells separating individual muscle fibers and charactersitically blood vessel walls are extensively replaced by trophoblastic cells and fibrinoid material. The ETT consists large necrotic areas with hyalinisation. Typically small blood vessels with preserved walls are located within the center of glycogen-rich monomorphous proliferation of trophoblastic cells.","1926":"In the invasive forms of fungal sinusitis rapid identification of etiologic agent is of vital importance because of the different reaction of the fungi to various antifungal agents. In the non-invasive forms it is of interest for epidemiologic reasons and because of the potential transition to invasive and generalized mycoses in case of additional immunodeficiency. A diagnosis of fungal genus in histologic slides is desirable since up to 70% of the fungal cultures remain without result.In the present study 77 cases of fungal sinusitis were examined with the comercially available antibodies Anti-Aspergillus and Anti-Rhizomucor. The results of the histological examination and fungal cultures were added. The immunohistochemical examination permitted in 64 cases a classification as Aspergillus\/Penicillium. Two cases caused by Zygomyzetes alone or in combination could be confirmed immunohistochemically. Four fungus balls showed no significant immunoreaction with both antibodies. If these where caused by other Hyphomycetes p.e. Pseudallescheria or if it where Aspergillus fungus balls that did not react because of extreme regressive change can not be decided.","1927":"Hirschsprung's disease (HD, aganglionosis) is the most important form of congenital disturbance of intestinal innervation, requiring surgical intervention. Furthermore, hypoganglionosis of the transitional zone forms the most significant factor in morbidity. Pre-operative definition of the length of neuronally disturbed segment is still a diagnostic challenge for both clinical physician and pathologist. Enzyme histochemical studies form the method of choice, but certain limitations in their use must be observed. Other dysganglionoses, particularly the so-called \"Intestinal Neuronal Dysplasia\" (IND) cannot-because of an excessive overlapping with age-correlated normal values-unequivocally be defined as an entity on its own. The only exception to this, is the ganglionic neuromatosis, which arises as part of a genetic illness.","1928":"In chronic myeloid leukemia following therapy with Imatinib (STI571) hematologic and cytogenetic response is associated with conspicuous changes of bone marrow morphology. However, it is not known to which extent these alterations are accompanied by a loss of the bcr\/abl translocation. To study regression of the leukemic cell population we recruited 14 patients lacking pretreatment. Therapy resulted in a reduction of CD61(+) megakaryopoiesis. Dwarf megakaryocytes characteristic for this disorder were replaced by large, normally appearing cells of this lineage. Morphometric analysis confirmed the significant decrease in the number of micromegakaryocytes and yielded planimetric parameters in keeping with normalization. Moreover, a fluorescence in-situ hybridization study in five patients of this cohort revealed that before therapy 70% of all myeloid cells exhibited the bcr\/abl gene. Regarding megakaryopoiesis about 65% of the micromegakaryocytes displayed positive signals. Following treatment these bcr\/abl(+) cell populations decreased significantly while the emerging large megakaryocytes lacked a proper labeling. Because cytogenetic response and reduction of atypical micromegakaryocytes are linked, this feature may be useful to monitor therapeutic efficacy.","1929":"Hepatic steatosis together with lactic acidosis is a life threatening side effect in HIV infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We describe 5 patients developing hepatic drug toxicity during longterm treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The main clinical symptoms included abdominal pain, fever, and neurological disorders. Serum lactate levels were elevated leading to severe metabolic acidosis in 3 cases. Liver biopsies revealed extensive macro- and microvesicular steatosis. Mitochondrial alterations were detected by electronmicroscopy. Microvesicular steatosis was seen in one case with elevated liver enzymes, but normal serum lactate levels, and was most extensive in a patient with a severe lactic acidotic coma. We conclude that detection of microvesicular steatosis and mitochondrial alterations in liver biopsies may help to identify the development of a nucleoside induced hepatopathy before the onset of severe lactic acidosis.","1930":"Transcription of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT), and increased tumor cell proliferation are powerful prognostic factors in neuroblastoma. We therefore investigated their relationship in a large group of neuroblastomas. RT-PCR analysis was used to discriminate between the various hTERT transcripts. Tumor cell proliferation was assessed immunohistochemically using two different cell-cycle specific antibodies and the results were compared by statistical analysis. 54 out of 115 neuroblastomas showed hTERT transcripts, 25 of which also possessed full-length transcripts. Full-length hTERT transcripts were correlated with MYCN-amplification, with a Ki67-proliferation index &gt; or = 25% and a repp86-proliferation index &gt; or = 10% (p&lt;0,0001), but only a Ki67-proliferation index &gt; or = 25% was associated with general hTERT transcription (p=0,001). Our data confirm the close relationship between hTERT transcription and tumor cell proliferation and further strengthen the exceptional prognostic power of the repp86-proliferation index. ","1931":"Renal cell carcinoma in children and adolescents is rare and comprises only about 1% of renal tumors in this age group. Since the last WHO classification in 1997, new entities of renal tumors in young patients have been described and have been included into the new 2004 WHO renal cell carcinoma classification. Renal cell carcinoma associated with neuroblastoma comprises 2.5% of renal cell carcinoma in young patients. It occurs several years after neuroblastoma. A large proportion of these tumors show allelic imbalance of chromosomes 20q13, 2p31-32.2, 13q22 and 14q31. TFE3-translocation carcinomas correspond to approximately 20% of renal cell carcinomas in the pediatric and adolescent age group. Both translocations t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) and t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) result in immunohistochemically detectable TFE3 protein overexpression. By conventional morphology, TFE3-translocation carcinomas typically show prominent \"voluminous\" clear cytoplasm and partially papillary architecture. Even according to the revised 2004 WHO classification, in children and adolescents, far more renal cell carcinomas than in the adult age group are currently not classifiable but constitute a phenotypically heterogeneous group with ample potential for future renal cell carcinoma subtypes.","1932":"Currently, vascular lesions are being classified either as tumors with inherent proliferative potential or as vascular malformations with early manifestation and growth commensurate with the growth of the child. This new classification is also applicable to skeletal vascular lesions. 30% of all skeletal vascular lesions manifest in the first two decades of life, with a preponderance of malformations. They are attributed to disturbances in the complex cascade of angiogenesis and a minority may be hereditary. Multiple cutaneous vascular malformations are associated with mutations of the TIE2- and Glomulin-Genes. Vascular malformations with involvement of multiple skeletal elements may pursue an aggressive course and manifest as massive osteolysis. Among the epithelioid vascular tumours of bone, also in young patients, benign epithelioid hemangioma can be distinguished on a morphological basis from epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as an entity with low malignant potential.","1933":"Following surgical resection locally advanced oesophageal carcinomas exhibit a bad prognosis and therefore neoadjuvant therapeutic strategies were developed. Because success of therapy is associated with the extent of tumor regression in this context, the introduction of objective histopathological criteria seems to be very important. This study included 67 patients with oesophageal carcinomas (cT2-cT4 cNx cM0) that were treated with a cisplatin- and 5-fluorouracil-containing simultaneous radiochemotherapy. In 43 patients squamous cell, in 24 cases adenocarcinomas were diagnosed. After completion of therapy, a surgical resection and a histopathological examination of the tissue specimens were performed. The extent of tumor regression was histologically evaluated and therapy-induced alterations were graded semiquantitatively. Thereby, a significantly favorable prognosis was observed in the group of patients that showed a regression of carcinomas of 90% or more. Additionally, the extent of a resorptive-histiocytic reaction, giant cells and lymphocytic infiltrates correlated with the grade of regression. These results underline the importance of an exact examination and histomorphological evaluation of the response for the assessment of survival probability after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy of oesophageal carcinomas.","1934":"A 51 year old caucasian male presented with headache, facial nerve paresis and continuing contraction of the visual field. CT scan revealed a singular intracerebral contrast enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe. Intraoperatively the tumour was well demarcated. Frozen sections showed a high grade glioma. Paraffin sections revealed, in addition to the gliomatous component, some sharply demarcated nests of meningothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry with glial fibrillary acidic protein and epithelial membrane antigen confirmed a collision tumour consisting of a glioblastoma WHO-grade IV and a meningothelial meningioma WHO-grade I. The coincidence of these two different tumours at the same time and the same location leads us to the speculation, that the collision tumour might have been caused by malignant transformation of a reactive astrogliosis surrounding the meningioma.","1935":"D2-40 is an antibody that reliably detects human lymphatic endothelial cells. Because little is known about the extent to which other cells are stained, we have investigated this question in various tissues. Normal, reactive and neoplastic lymphatics (including lymphangiomas and Stewart-Treves syndrome) were stained by D2-40. Published findings indicate that some angiosarcomas and Kaposi are positive. Staining was also found in the following non-endothelial cells: mesothelial cells, follicular dendritic reticulum cells, Cajal cells, a few epithelial cells in the dermis, myoepithelial cells (e. g. breast), and basal cells (e. g. prostata), various mesenchymal cells. The following tumours were reactive: myofibroblastic tumours, gastrointestinal stromal tumour, mesothelioma, adenomatoid tumour, traumatic neuroma, seminoma, seminoma in situ and other testicular tumours, pleomorphic adenoma (one of two tumours positive), and follicular dendritic reticulum cell sarcoma. Despite this relatively broad spectrum of reactivity, we consider D2-40 to be the best commercially available antibody for the delineation of normal, reactive and neoplastic lymphatic endothelial cells.","1936":"","1937":"Histological detection of mycosis can be laboriously but can be easier by a simple fluorescenceoptical method. Optical brighteners (e.g. blankophor, calcofluor) make it possible to detect fungus cell walls without significant background fluorescence of resident tissue. Mycosis can be detected even in cytological slides after maceration by brighteners.","1938":"We report a rare case of a neuroendocrine carcinoma located in the esophagus of a 62-year-old male patient. The initial diagnosis of a \"small-cell tumor\" was based on biopsy. Our diagnosis was based on the histomorphological examination of the resected material. Diagnostic criteria were the characteristic solid or clustered growth patterns, monomorphic cell nuclei, lack of necrosis, immunohistochemical detection of neuroendocrine markers like chromogranin, synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as well as detection of cytoplasmic neuroendocrine granules by electron microscopy. In addition, we found an increased prolific activity by staining with Ki67 antigen. 30% of the cell nuclei displayed a positive reaction. Focal invasion of blood vessels was also detected. With 17 different chromosomal imbalances, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a malignant tumor stage that was not visible at the microscopic level. According to the new WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors the described tumor was identified as an intermediate between a well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma and a low-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.","1939":"Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML) was described in 1969 by Rosai and Dorfman as an benign disorder of the lymph nodes. Involvement of extranodal sites by SHML may occur as part of a generalized disease involving lymph nodes as well as independently of the lymph node status. The clinical course is mostly benign and indolent, but in rare cases the SHML can cause death. We report 5 cases of extranodal Rosai Dorfman disease (ENSHML). The lesions were localized in the soft tissue of the extremities, the head and the skeleton. Histopathological examination revealed a lymphoplasmacellular infiltration and numerous histiocytes with an eosinophilic cytoplasma and vesicular nuclei with basophilic nucleoli. The histiocytes showed emperipolesis with multiple lymphocytes within the cytoplasm and occasionally phagocytosis of other inflammatory cells. The histiocytes were immunohistochemically positive for S 100 protein and macrophage-specific antibodies, but in paraffin material negative for CD1a. We briefly discuss aspects of differential diagnosis of this lesion, too.","1940":"The practical use of the legally required documentation of occupational diseases is demonstrated by a case of asbestos-related pleural mesothelioma. During the mandatory inquest before cremation, information of manifest pleural mesothelioma had been relayed to the widow of the patient, and an investigation for a possible occupational disease was performed. Reconstruction of the case showed that in the course of 3 months at least 13 physicians had been involved in in-hospital as well as ambulatory therapeutic measures. Until death, none of them informed the trade association about a suspected occupational disease in accordance with BK 4105 of the codex of occupational diseases, although the diagnosis of manifest pleural mesothelioma had been histologically confirmed already 10 weeks prior to the death of the patient. This case demonstrates obvious and evident deficiencies in applying the Code of Social Law VII, which requires physicians to report occupational diseases. In addition, it shows the importance of the post-mortem examination as a control function before cremation.","1941":"The Papanicolaou smear (Pap) is a worldwide screening tool for early detection of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions. The transition from dysplasia to cancer is a highly complex genetic process and cannot be predicted based solely on cell morphology. Molecular characterization of precursor lesions could yield a better definition of lesions at high risk for progression. We developed an analytical concept comprising not only morphological characterization but also molecular analysis with multiple parameters of dysplastic cells from cervical smears. We isolated dysplastic cells from 52 fixed Pap-stained smears of various grades by laser microdissection and analyzed them for genetic lesions typical for cervical carcinoma. The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as published for cervical carcinoma tissue was detected. Markers for early stages showed a LOH in 43% and 22%, and those for late stages in 26% of the cases. Combining morphological characterization with molecular analysis by multiple molecular markers could open up new opportunities for early detection of cervical carcinoma.","1942":"Diagnostic pathological examination of surgical specimens from patients with hip joint osteoarthrosis occasionally exhibits as yet undescribed pseudocysts consisting of folded granular membranes in necrotic or chondroid tissues. When stained with Sudan red, the content of these cysts indicates the presence of lipid substances. The presence of S100 protein-positive cells with intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles as well as such cells in the walls indicate that they develop from fat inclusions occurring in the chondroid cells of the labrum. Two different wall structures were detected by electron microscopy. The first type exhibited small walls of a granular material similar to the endoplasmic reticulum that surrounds intracytoplasmic fat globules. The second type consisted of broad layers of very tiny granules indicating a more advanced stage of the development of these cysts. The reason for the occurrence of these \"chondrocytogenic lipid cysts\" remains unknown-it may be assumed that they are due to mechanical labrum destruction that occurs in osteoarthrosis.","1943":"Microscopic analysis of resection specimens of non-small cell lung cancer after neoadjuvant therapy evokes the subjective impression of cytologic changes, especially enlargement of the individual tumor cells and their nuclei. Therefore, objectivization of these changes was tested morphometrically. Corresponding investigations could be carried out in 24 patients who had each received identical neoadjuvant therapy. The diameters and areas of the tumor cells and their nuclei as well as the nucleocytoplasmic ratio were assessed. The adenocarcinomas investigated revealed a significant cellular enlargement after treatment. Moreover, in 18 resection specimens (75%), cytomorphological changes could be shown in comparison to untreated tumor tissue. The cellular and nuclear parameters analysed as well as the cytomorphological changes assessed showed no significant correlation to the grade of therapy-induced tumor regression and thus do not allow an assessment of therapy success. Based on these results, grading of non-small cell lung cancer is not recommended after neoadjuvant therapy and the diagnosis of \"large cell anaplastic\" carcinoma should be made with reservation.","1944":"Although twin studies indicate that inherited genetic factors contribute to about 35% of colorectal cancers (CRC), the exact genetic background has currently been elucidated in only 5-10% of cases. These comprise several hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes that present with a high number of syn- or metachronous neoplasms within an affected person and\/or family. Many of these tumors exhibit typical histopathological changes. In general, one should discriminate between cancer syndromes associated with adenomatous and non-adenomatous (i.e., hamartomatous) polyps, the latter being quite rare. The patient's age often serves as a substantial hint to hereditary cancer. The next step of diagnostic work-up includes analysis of microsatellite instability (MSI) together with immunohistochemical detection of a loss of expression in one of the most frequently affected mismatch repair genes (MSH2, MSH6; MLH1, PMS2). Finally, the molecular demonstration of a gene mutation in the blood or germline is the most expensive and tedious procedure. This requires a signed informed consent from the patient after appropriate genetic counseling.","1945":"Anorectal melanomas represent a very small group of mucosal melanoma with unknown etiology and poor prognosis. In view of their location, a history of sun exposure is not likely to have had an impact on their development. Recent epidemiologic data indicate a bimodal age distribution. To date there is no information whether an infection with the human papilloma virus plays a role in the tumorigenesis of anorectal melanoma. The lesions can be misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids on clinical examination. On histological examination amelanotic types have been misdiagnosed as lymphoma, sarcoma,and undifferentiated carcinoma. Useful immunohistochemical markers are S 100 protein, HMB-45, Melan A, and MiTF (microphthalmia-transcription-factor). Therapy includes local excision or abdominoperineal resection followed by optional inguinal and parailiac lymph node dissection, and consecutive chemo- and immunotherapy. The poor long-term prognosis of anorectal melanomas correlates with their advanced tumor size and depth of infiltration at diagnosis. The overall 5-year survival rates range between &lt;5 and 22% in different series.","1946":"A case of extranodal sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (ENSHML; Rosai-Dorfman disease) is reported. The patient presented with a history of intracranial tumour and exophthalmus. Clinical examination found a large mass in the left orbit and paranasal sinuses. Excisional biopsy showed a dense fibrous tissue with an infiltrate rich in macrophages. Further evaluation revealed a retroperitoneal mass with consecutive ureteral stenosis. Further histological and immunohistochemical investigation of the orbital mass, now in suspicion of a systemic disease showed an infiltrate of S-100-positive histiocytes and emperipolesis allowing the diagnosis of extranodal sinus histiocytosis. The correct histologic diagnosis was delayed due to the unusual and isolated extranodal localisation of the disease. The literature concerning extranodal manifestations of Rosai-Dorfman disease is reviewed. We suggest the additional evaluation of such rare and unusual cases in experienced reference centers.","1947":"We describe a case of mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney. The tumor was identified in a 63 years old woman and retroperitoneoscopically resected. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed. Grossly, the tumor was well-circumscribed with a diameter of 8 cm and consisted of solid and cystic components. Microscopically, the spindle cell component ranged in appearance from scar-like fibrous tissue to leiomyoma-like fascicles. Epithelial elements were composed of tubules with variable lining. The tubules were focally transformed into large cysts. Estrogen and progesteron receptors were detected in the nuclei of the spindle cells. Electron microscopy confirmed a smooth-muscle differentiation of the spindle cells. Previously, such tumors were published as adult mesoblastic nephroma or cystic hamartoma of the renal pelvis. Its predominance in females with a history of long-term estrogen replacement or the history of long-term sex-steroid use in a male patient, combined with the expression of estrogen und progesteron receptors in the spindle cells suggest that hormonal influence is relevant for the development of these tumors.","1948":"At an incidence of 3.2-4% world-wide, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is the most common disease of pregnancy. Since this holds a risk, not only for the mother, but also for the child, the placenta should undergo pathological-anatomical examination in every case. Pathomorphological findings can be described in the feto-maternal border zone as well as in the fetal placenta. These are not, however, specific, nor do they offer diagnostic proof. Pathomorphological findings in the feto-maternal border zone: defective invasion of the extravillous cytotrophoblast, hyperplastic arterio-\/arteriolopathy, acute atherosclerosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of endothelium. Disorders of the fetal part of placenta: infarctions\/fibrin deposits, obliterative angiopathy, stromal fibrosis\/fibrinoid degeneration, syncytiotrophoblastic nodes (Tenney-Parker-phenomenon), and disturbances of maturation of the villi. There is a general lack of correlation between the seriousness of the disease and the morphology. The only exception in this respect are the findings in the vessels both of the placental bed and of the chronic villi. These show a high correlation with doppler sonographic findings.","1949":"The history of gallbladder involvement by a malignant melanoma in a 65-year-old woman is reported. The gallbladder, clinically resected for cholecystitis, harboured a polypoid dark pigmented tumour. The tumour was identified as a malignant melanoma immunohistochemically by positive reactions for gp100 (HMB45), melan A, and MiTF. Clinically, the patient was treated for cutaneous malignant melanoma by local excision 10 years earlier. The literature of pigmented lesions of the gallbladder is reviewed. In conclusion, the most important differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the gallbladder is the secondary gallbladder melanoma.","1950":"Paleopathological examinations can give an idea of diseases and living conditions in ancient populations. An archaeological collection of 364 late medieval\/early modern skeletons from the thirteenth to eighteenth centuries, excavated from a church cemetery in the Rostock town center, was examined palaeopathologically. The type and frequency of certain diseases within this north German urban population are described. The majority of the skeletons were from adults with a remarkably low percentage of children. Skeletal malformations (e.g. gap formations of the spinal column) were not abnormally represented. With the exception of single individuals, metabolic disorders or unusual infectious diseases could not be diagnosed. Degenerative diseases often found at the joints and the spinal column showed substantially lower prevalences in comparison with reference rural populations. Individual cases of benign and rare malignant neoplasms could be documented. Traumatic injuries as well as dental pathological changes were rare. In summary it can be concluded that the individuals buried here belonged to a better social class within the medieval population of Rostock.","1951":"Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE, CD143) is an endothelial transmembrane Zn2+-dipeptidylpeptidase. By formation of angiotensin II and degrading bradykinin it acts as a vasoconstrictor. We examined endothelial ACE expression in human pulmonary vessels in specimens from 20 female and 19 male patients (age: 34-76 years) by immunohistochemistry. In all specimens, capillary endothelial cells showed the strongest expression, followed by those in arterioles and arteries. Venules and veins showed next to no staining. The differences in staining intensities were significant ( P&lt;0.001). Sex affected neither the expression intensity nor the expression pattern. Summarizing, we demonstrate the existence of a vessel-type specific ACE expression pattern for pulmonary vessels. The nearly exclusive endothelial ACE expression in capillaries and arterial vessels points to ACE as an immunohistochemical marker for these vessels in normal lung tissue.","1952":"In recent years microcomputed tomography (microCT) has become more and more important in basic research. Now commercial microCT scanners are available. Thus, it is very likely that this new, accurate and promising method for three-dimensional and non-destructive quantitative evaluation of intact tissues including vessels will be applied more frequently. The review provides a survey of the basic technology of microCT and its current use for high resolution three-dimensional morphometric and functional analysis within the cardio-pulmonary vascular system.","1953":"To elucidate the effect of first-line treatment with interferon (IFN), hydroxyurea (HU) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571) on angiogenesis, we studied bone marrow (BM) biopsies in 104 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 138 patients before and after allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT). After immunostaining (CD34) and morphometric analysis in comparison with a control group, CML specimens showed an increased vascularity and conspicuous morphological abnormalities of microvessels. A close relationship between microvessels and fiber density was detectable in initial biopsies and also in repeatedly performed examinations following therapy. Monotherapy by imatinib and HU generated a significant reduction of microvessels and reticulin fibers in contrast to changes after IFN administration or combination regimens of IFN and HU. A persistence of numerical and structural anomalies of vasculature was observable even several months after BMT. These anomalies shed some light on disturbances of the stroma compartment after myeloablative therapy. The relationship between BM vascularity and fibers is probably dependent on concomitant changes of megakaryopoiesis as the source of various mediators involved in the development of myelofibrosis and neo-angiogenesis acting within a complex functional network.","1954":"Until now the causal and formal pathogenesis of the inflammatory aortic aneurysm is poorly known. This report shows the pathological- anatomical findings of surgical and autoptical preparations, on the one hand 78 months and on the other hand 82 months, after vascular-prosthetical treatment of inflammatory aneurysms in the abdominal and thoracal part of the aorta. By morphological studies it was possible to reveal, the over years existing disease, the typical picture of inflammatory aneurysm, focal destruction of the genuine aortic wall and partial substitution by inflammatory-fibrous, less qualitative granulation tissue. Even 6 1\/2 years past the implantation of the Dacron-prosthesis, there is still no complete ingrown. In addition to the known findings of the transprosthetical organization with a variable development of the outer connective-tissued coat and neointima, the incorporated granulation-tissue was overlapped by a strong inflammation according to the basic disease. In several parts of the inflammatory destructed aortic wall, there is still no fixed incorporation of the prosthesis after 7 years, so that \"hypermobile-prosthetic-parts\" can be found as a result.","1955":"A circumferential aortic dissection with so-called intimo-intimal intussusception is a very rare complication of a dissecting aneurysm, in which the sock-like intimal flap is upended in the true lumen by the blood stream. The few cases reported thus far are based on radiological or intraoperative findings in acute dissections. The present postmortem study documents the very rare case of long-term survival of a chronic circumferential dissection with intimo-intimal intussusception.","1956":"This report describes the pathological-anatomical and immunohistochemical findings of carotid arteries after incorporation of self-expanding metal stents. Ten stent specimens were examined. All specimens displayed variable expression patterns of chronic low-grade foreign body reactions in the vicinity of the incorporated stent struts as characterized by the appearance of CD68-positive macrophages and mainly CD3- and CD45-R0-positive T lymphocytes. Overwhelming proliferations in relation to intimal hyperplasia can be regarded as the main cause of stent-associated vascular restenosis. After a period of 6 months the expression of factor VIII-positive neoendothelial cells on the luminal surface can be detected in individual cases. Reactions of the vascular wall depend on the state of the underlying atherosclerotic lesions prior to stenting. In cases of predominantly atheromatous soft plaques, the typical reaction pattern triggered by the metallic foreign body pressed into vessel tissue can be absent. In summary, the morphological findings show a chronic tissue reaction in response to stent incorporation. In addition, individually differing reaction patterns ranging from discrete inflammatory changes to massive stenoses were identified and documented.","1957":"","1958":"","1959":"A 61 years old female was treated by total lumpectomy due to a palpable and radiologically demonstrable tumor measuring 22 cm in diameter in the left breast. Two different but directly neighboured malignant tumours were found: a poorly differentiated leiomyosarcoma and a well differentiated invasive papillary carcinoma of the breast. The latter had metastasized in 4 axillary lymph nodes. Three months after surgery the patient died. Post-mortem studies showed many metastases of the leiomyosarcoma in both lungs, the heart, the liver, the left kidney and both adrenals. Cause of death were relapsing pulmonary thrombembolisms. Case reports of leiomyosarcomas following radiotherapy of the breast cancer are published but coincidental occurrence of both metastasizing tumors are so far not known from the literature.","1960":"Benign and malignant skin adnexal neoplasms, especially glandular lesions, show morphologically striking similarities to salivary gland tumors. On the other hand, histological and clinical differences are evident, and knowledge of their existence is important for adequate treatment and reliable prognostication. In this review similarities and differences of selected entities are briefly described and discussed. The following entities are reviewed: cylindroma (vs. membranous variant of basal cell adenoma), sebaceoma (vs. sebaceous adenoma), syringocystadenoma papilliferum (vs. sialadenoma papilliferum), chondroid syringoma (vs. pleomorphic adenoma), cutaneous myoepithelioma (vs. myoepithelioma of salivary glands), cutaneous malignant myoepithelioma (vs. malignant myoepithelioma of salivary glands), cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma (vs. adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary glands), and mucinous eccrine carcinoma (vs. mucous carcinoma of salivary glands).","1961":"An encapsulated tumor measuring 8 cm was removed from the parotid gland in a 42-year-old man. The tumor had grown for about 5 years. The histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation revealed a lymphadenoma without sebaceous differentiation of the epithelial component. The tumor consisted of exclusively solid epithelial islands and a lymphoid stroma with rare lymph follicles and abundant predominantly IgG plasma cells. The histogenesis of lymphadenomas is discussed in consideration of the differential diagnosis from Warthin's tumor and the data in the literature.","1962":"This tutorial focuses on malignant lymphomas and inflammatory conditions as potential precursors of primary malignant lymphomas in salivary glands. Salivary glands display a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and are often associated with intra- and periglandular lymph nodes. Inflammation of the glands may variably produce duct ectasia, lymphoepithelial lesions, atrophy, and fibrosis. Primary lymphomas of the salivary glands may develop on the basis of autoimmune sialadenitis and comprise most frequently marginal zone lymphomas, less often monocytoid lymphomas or other lymphoma entities. In a large proportion of cases, lymphoma infiltrates are attributable to extraglandular lymphomas either as a leukemic infiltrate with diffuse enlargement or as a localized manifestation of primary nodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Diagnosis is based on conventional histology and immunohistology.","1963":"Undifferentiated salivary gland carcinomas may be divided into small cell and large cell types. Among large cell undifferentiated carcinomas, lymphoepithelial carcinomas have to be distinguished, the latter of which are endemic in the Arctic regions and southern China where virtually all cases of these tumors are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Association with EBV may also be observed in sporadic cases, and detection of EBV gene products may aid their diagnosis. Immunohistology may be employed to resolve the differential diagnosis of undifferentiated salivary gland carcinomas, comprising malignant lymphomas, amelanotic melanomas, Merkel cell carcinomas, and adenoid cystic carcinomas, in particular in small biopsy materials. Because of the rarity of undifferentiated salivary gland carcinomas, the differential diagnosis should always include metastases of undifferentiated carcinomas arising at other primary sites, particularly when expressing the thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1).","1964":"The diagnosis of basaloid tumors of the salivary glands can be challenging. In most cases, conventional histologic examination, if carried out meticulously, will be sufficient. Yet, immunohistochemistry will be of help for the definition of purely myoepithelial tumors, basaloid squamous cell carcinomas, and canalicular adenomas. The differential diagnosis of canalicular adenoma, basal cell adenoma and basal cell adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, myoepithelial tumors, epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is discussed.","1965":"In addition to staging, histological typing and grading provide important information for prognosis and adequate treatment of salivary gland cancers. Current classification and grading systems for mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant mixed tumor (carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma) are discussed.","1966":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) is a heterodimeric enzyme involved in the regulation of mitogenesis, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and motility. PI3-K was suggested as a protooncogene in human cancer. To determine the expression of PI3-K during cancerogenesis and tumor invasion of HNSCC, we investigated normal and dysplastic epithelium of the oral cavity, squamous cell carcinoma and lymph node metastasis by immunohistochemistry. The strongest immunoreactivity for p85alpha and p110alpha was found in invasive tumors and their metastases. Carcinomas in situ showed a focal positivity. Dysplasias and normal epithelium reacted predominantly negatively. The PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited proliferation and invasion of the HNSCC cell line CAL-27 and induced apoptosis in vitro. Our data suggest PI3-K as a marker of malignancy and tumor invasion. We suggest including PI3-K in the multistep carcinogenesis model of HNSCC. In addition, PI3-K is a potential target for pharmacological intervention.","1967":"Approximately 15% of malignant diseases are caused by infectious agents. Human papilloma viruses (HPV) can be frequently found in oral carcinomas, especially tonsillar cancer. A group of HPV-infected tumors shows clear signs for a virally induced transformation process: high-risk HPVs can be detected in all tumor cells, the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are constantly expressed and lead to upregulation of cellular p16(INK4a), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The patients frequently lack typical risk factors associated with head and neck cancers such as drinking and smoking. Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV) are associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and cause nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). NPC has a high incidence in some East Asian countries. In this review, the molecular pathogenesis of HPV- and EBV-associated malignancies are described and the clinical relevance of the presented findings is discussed.","1968":"Sinonasal carcinomas are usually of the squamous cell or transitional cell type. Adenocarcinomas of the inner nose and the paranasal sinus correlate with exposure to wood dust. However, this is only true for adenocarcinomas of the intestinal type and not for salivary gland carcinomas or polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas. Of 160 cases with a history of wood dust exposure and malignant tumors of the inner nose, 134 were sinonasal adenocarcinomas of the intestinal type (SNAIT). In addition, there were 24 other carcinomas as well as 1 malignant melanoma and 1 malignant synovial tumor. The SNAIT showed various subtypes with great morphological similarities to colorectal adenocarcinomas (papillary tubular cylinder cell: 72.4%; alveolar goblet cell: 5.2%; signet ring cell: 3.7%; transitional type: 18.7%). Highly differentiated adenocarcinomas (G1) and mucinous adenocarcinomas were relatively frequent: they accounted for 23.1% and 29.1% of the 134 SNAIT, respectively. Apart from wood dust, wood additives are discussed as a carcinogenic factor. With the development of SNAIT, a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma in situ sequence is probable. If the clinical course shows few symptoms, the first manifestation of such a tumor often occurs in an advanced stage.","1969":"Laryngeal cancer is the most frequent malignancy of the upper respiratory tract. Only the very early treatment of tumors or even of their precursor lesions will be both curative and organ preserving. Microsurgical techniques facilitate early detection and complete removal of limited lesions can be achieved quite frequently, but follow-up data for such lesions are difficult to obtain. The resulting lack of endpoint observations (i.e., malignant transformation, spontaneous involution) hampers the development, testing, and application of grading systems focusing on epithelial alterations, especially changes with only mild nuclear atypia and minimal structural alteration. Such lesions may be entirely benign or may indicate premalignant stages of well-differentiated carcinoma. For diagnosis we recommend a modified Kleinsasser's system to classify premalignant epithelial changes. Only the complete removal of suspicious lesions as far as possible or regular clinical follow-up in cases where complete removal cannot be achieved can prevent the development of advanced stage cancer.","1970":"Synthetic grafts are used as arterio-venous fistulae (shunts) for dialysis therapy of patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Today grafts made of PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) are commonly used. Grafts with diameter of 6 mm are implanted subcutaneously. In rare cases stenosis or thrombosis cause explantation of the grafts. Our results, obtained on 10 samples taken from surgery or autopsy, revealed that the main causes for graft explantation are destructions and perforations of the graft's wall caused by needle puncturing during dialysis. Single defects of the implants wall ranging from 200-500 micro m, and in some cases up to 1,5 mm are \"repaired\" by connective tissue. But greater defects cannot be compensated and are insufficiently covered by a network of loose connective tissue. These zones are under the predominated sites for development of false prosthetic aneurysm, which show parallel to posttraumatic aneurysms of vessels. Prosthetic aneurysms up to diameters of 3,2 cm were seen. Suitable choice of puncturing sites and puncturing technique can help to avoid destruction of the synthetic material.","1971":"Fluorescence diagnosis after application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) detects red-fluorescing preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions using light excitation. The principle of the method is the relative tumor-selective accumulation of the metabolite protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), which is built intracellularly out of exogenously applied ALA. The early detection of tumors and especially preneoplasias is an ideal prerequisite for genetic analysis of these lesions. With this approach, methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and loss of heterozygosity analysis for deletion mapping as well as gene sequencing data could be compared. New data are presented on deletions, numeric chromosomal aberrations, and oligoclonality of tumors found in about 30% of cases. The phenomenon of tumor-selective fluorescence was further investigated by parallel biochemical analysis, which showed marked differences in heme metabolism. The analysis of gene and protein expression may aid in identifying tumor-specific molecules associated with heme metabolism.","1972":"We report 2 primary renal synovial sarcoma. These tumors were formerly designated as embryonal cystic sarcoma of the kidney. Most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Some cases show local recurrence after nephrectomy. On gross examination, tumors are large, partially necrotic, and usually contain cysts. Microscopically, tumors are characterized by monomorphic plump spindle cells. The cysts are lined by mitotically inactive epithelial cells without striking cellular atypia. The spindle cells were immunoreactive for EMA, CD56, and sometimes for CD99. They were non-reactive for desmin, actin, S 100, and cytokeratins. The cyst epithelium is cytokeratin positive. The presence of a SYT-SSX gene fusion resulting from the t(X;18) characteristic for synovial sarcoma was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in both tumors. Primary renal synovial sarcoma is a distinctive tumor entity, which should be considered in renal tumors consisting of spindle cells.","1973":"Primary manifestation of malignant lymphoma and\/or leukaemia rarely occurs in the kidney. It can be the cause of a hitherto unexplained acute renal failure or it is incidentally detected as shown in the three cases under report.1.A 68-year-old man was operated on because of a symptomatic tumour in his right kidney. At nephrectomy, a conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma was found simultaneously with an occult mantle cell lymphoma infiltrating the adjacent renal and extrarenal tissue. Clinical follow-up uncovered nodal and bone marrow involvement, so that a primary renal manifestation of mantle cell lymphoma was apparent.2.A 69-year-old man with suspected vertebral metastasis underwent partial renal resection because of a mass in his left kidney. Histologically and immunohistochemically, the renal infiltration was diagnosed as a precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma. After chemotherapy and irradiation, leukaemic blood cell counts with 50% lymphoblasts proved a primary renal manifestation of precursor B-lymphoblastic leukaemia\/lymphoma.3.A 13-year-old boy presented clinically with renal failure, enlarged kidneys, and normal urinalysis. Renal biopsy showed a diffuse interstitial infiltration with atypical T-lymphoblasts compressing tubules and surrounding preserved glomeruli. Subsequent clinical bone marrow smears presented 60% T-lymphoblasts, so that the final diagnosis of a primary renal manifestation of acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia of mature thymic cortex type was made. Immediate chemotherapy resulted in total recovery of renal function and bone marrow findings.","1974":"The new WHO-classification of renal tumors includes new subtypes, one of which is the mucinous, tubular, and spindle cell carcinoma. Many of these tumors had been previously diagnosed as sarcomatoid carcinoma. There are areas of cord-like growth and spindle cell configuration, sometimes with a clear cell appearance. The cells have low-grade nuclear features. It has been postulated that these tumors are related to the loop of Henle. In this study, 21 tumors were immunohistochemically and genetically analyzed. The analysis showed complex genomic aberrations, but no chromosome 3p losses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected no von Hippel-Lindau gene deletions on chromosome 3p25, which are characteristic for clear cell renal carcinomas. These findings show that there is no genetic relationship to clear cell renal carcinomas. The results of the immunohistochemical analyses showed a complex immunophenotype, but could not prove a derivation from the loop of Henle. The prognosis of these tumors seems to be favorable.","1975":"A non-ischemic acute renal failure may indicate a hantavirus nephropathy, so that appropriate serological examinations should be done. A 19-year-old man had acutely fallen ill with fever, rhinitis, and arthralgia. Clinically, he presented with a polyuric renal failure as well as hypertension, proteinuria, erythro- and leucocyturia. Serologically, IgG- and IgM-hantavirus antibodies were found against the Central European variant of hantavirus Dobrava. At renal biopsy, tubular epithelial swelling, vacuolization, and necrosis as well as interstitial hemorrhages were seen. Electron microscopically, virion particles with a gridlike surface structure as well as with the shape and dimension evident of hantaviruses could be detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm of renal tubular cells. After a clinical course of 3 weeks, the patient was free of complaints and cured with a restitutio ad integrum.","1976":null,"1977":"A 26-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever of unknown origin and renal failure. Diagnosis of Fabry's disease, extracapillary proliferative (crescentic) glomerulonephritis and granulomatous interstitial nephritis was made by histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopical diagnosis in a kidney biopsy and confirmed by further investigations. Years ago the brother of the patient had a kidney biopsy diagnosed as metabolic disease. The re-evaluation of this biopsy confirmed Fabry's disease while in this patient an association with tubulointerstitial nephritis occurred. To our knowledge this is the first family with two members having Fabry's disease combined with further kidney diseases.","1978":"Lupus nephritis is a common phenomenon in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). We analyzed a renal biopsy of a 30-year-old woman with SLE. The clinical history showed a typical SLE with generalized symptoms without demonstrable lupus coagulant, positive for anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-ds-DNA antibodies but negative for rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins and antiphospholipid antibodies. A paraproteinemia for IgA, IgG and IgM was not detectable. Using light, electron and immunoelectron microscopy electron-dense deposits were noted in subepithelial, subendothelial and mesangial position. Most remarkably, the electron-dense deposits and mesangial areas in the vicinity of deposits contained an electron-dense crystalline material. The crystalline structures were composed of IgG and kappa light chains, while they were negative for IgM, IgA and lambda light chains, as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy. As far as we know, this is the first case of lupus nephritis with crystalline structures. Since we could not detect cryoglobulinemia or paraproteinemia, other mechanisms possibly favor organization of macromolecular structures.","1979":"Renal biopsies studied by light and electron microscopy as well as by immunohistochemistry seem to be continually necessary for an adequate typing and therapy of glomerulonephritis (GN) and other glomerular diseases. Basing on 653 renal biopsies examined in Rostock from 1990 to 1999, the morphological classification in a total of 585 cases with glomerular diseases is presented in comparison to their clinical syndromes according to the WHO classification. A nephrotic syndrome was most frequent and clinically reported in 258 of the 585 biopsy cases with glomerular diseases (44%). It was seen in 77 of the 87 cases with minimal change nephropathy (55%), in 46 of the 74 cases with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (62%), and in 19 of the 24 diffuse membranous GN cases (79%). The majority of the varying histological subtypes of diffuse GN was not combined with a specific clinical syndrome except of diffuse crescentic GN presenting with a rapidly progressive nephritic syndrome in 14 of 16 cases (88%). IgA nephropathy was the most often diagnosed entity of glomerular diseases found in 122 of the 502 cases with primary or secondary GN (24%). It is obvious that a given morphological GN type can but must not be combined with a specific clinical GN syndrome, so that the clinical importance of renal biopsy is stressed.","1980":"The classification of cystic kidney diseases according to the pathologic-anatomic potter classification may be difficult. New molecular genetic findings are important to understand the underlying pathogenesis, but less useful to classify the hereditary diseases. An exact classification of polycystic kidney disease in fetus and children is very important for the human genetic consultation. Therefore, the investigation of pathological anatomy of kidney and liver, as well as the evaluation of additional malformations and family history is necessary. For clinical use the mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive) is used to differentiate hereditary polycystic kidney diseases.","1981":"Most hormonally active ovarian tumors belong to the category of tumors of the gonadal stroma. These account for less than 5% of all ovarian tumors. About two-thirds of tumors of the gonadal stroma produce steroid hormones. The pathologic secretion of estrogenic or androgenic hormones leads to specific effects on the hormone-sensitive target organs. The clinical manifestations depend on both the amount of hormones secreted and the age of the patient. Tumors of the gonadal stroma are potentially malignant, ranging between noninvasive (borderline) tumors and invasive epithelial tumors of the ovary. Besides the specifically steroid hormone-producing tumors, a wide variety of ovarian tumors other than those in the stroma of the ovary and steroid cell tumors may be hormonally active as the result of an increase in and\/or stimulation of nonneoplastic ovarian stromal cells within or adjacent to the tumor.","1982":"The most characteristic endocrine tumours of the testis are germ cell tumours and sex cord\/gonadal stromal tumours. They include the primary carcinoid, the relation of which to teratomas is still unclear. In general, gonadal stromal tumours are rare, however, endocrine activity occurs in at least 10%-20%. Among gonadal stromal tumours, only Leydig cell tumours and Sertoli cell tumours are of practical importance. Endocrine disorders are mostly related to Leydig cell tumours (gynaecomastia, pubertas praecox). Although less frequent than the other gonadal stromal tumours, they can, in principle, occur. The large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour occurs in association with other complex disorders (i.e. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Valuable markers are: inhibin, calretinin, cytokeratin, melan-A, CD-99, Ki-67, androgen receptor and p53. As the conventional morphology and immunohistological markers frequently overlap, unclear cases should be referred to specialised centres.","1983":"According to the 1999 World Health Organisation classification of lung tumors, the classification of neuroendocrine (NE) tumors is solely based on light-microscopic features. Typical and atypical carcinoid tumors are distinguished from large cell (LCNEC) and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCLC). We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on 50 samples to investigate the cytogenetic relationships between NE tumors. On average, carcinoid tumors showed markedly fewer chromosomal imbalances (1.8\/case, 23 cases) than LCNEC (13.3\/case, 17 cases) or SCLC (17\/case, 10 cases). The frequency of amplicons increased accordingly. Typical carcinoid tumors exhibited significant defects on chromosomes 11 and 13 only. Interestingly, only the frequency of losses on chromosome arm 11q was very similar for all three tumor entities (about 30%). In conclusion, the CGH results support the classification of typical carcinoid tumors as a separate entity in clear distinction from the NE carcinomas.","1984":"Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung can be seen as a separate entity, in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO classification of 1999, in terms of immunohistochemical findings in biopsy material as well as in more extensive resections. The characterization of carcinoid tumors and small cell lung cancer by the pathologist according to histomorphological and cytological criteria is commonly accepted, and is of decided importance with regard to clinical questions and therapeutic measures.However, it is still unclear whether the \"new\" group of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomata of the lung has to be regarded as a separate entity with clinical and therapeutic relevance, or whether this group remains within the non-small cell lung cancers as a special form of differentiation. These complex questions can only be answered by studies targeting the course of the disease and the results of therapy.","1985":"The diffuse neuroendocrine cell system of the gastrointestinal tract gives rise to the neuroendocrine neoplasms. The WHO classification distinguishes between well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of benign or uncertain behavior, well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas of low grade malignancy and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas of high grade malignancy. The well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and carcinomas correspond to the carcinoids of earlier classifications. Further biological and prognostic classification of these neoplasms must consider the localization of the tumors within the gastrointestinal tract. This system allows a clinically relevant diagnosis and includes all so far known tumor entities.","1986":"The sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia are the site of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. The adrenal pheochromocytoma and the abdominal paraganglioma derive from the sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic paragangliomas are predominantly localized in the head and neck region. Most pheochromocytomas are hormonally active and benign. The abdominal paragangliomas usually correspond to adrenal pheochromocytomas, but are more commonly malignant. The parasympathetic paragangliomas are usually benign, hormonally inactive and are most commonly located in the bifurcation of the carotid artery.","1987":"Adrenocortical tumours have to be differentiated from cortical hyperplasias, medullary tumours and extra-adrenal tumours or metastases. These diagnoses are mostly possible using routine paraffin sections. In some cases, immunostaining for differing cortical and medullary tumours and metastases are necessary. Adrenal hyperplasias can be congenital or acquired. They are diffuse, micronodular or macronodular and may be inactive or induce a cortical hyperfunction. Very rarely, macronodular hyperplasias may transform into autonomous adenomas. Primary, pigmented adrenocortical disease is a rare, special type of primary adrenal Cushing's syndrome, showing many small tumours with pleomorphic cells and an atrophic surrounding cortical tissue. Adrenal adenomas are mostly unilateral and solitary tumours weighing less than 50 g. Adrenal cortical carcinomas are mostly larger. Like the adenomas, they may be inactive and may induce a hypercortisolism, a hyperandrogenism or (very rarely in carcinomas) a hyperaldosteronism. Differentiating cortical adenomas and carcinomas is difficult in some cases but is possible using a diagnostic algorithm. Myelolipomas are benign, inactive tumours composed of mature fat cells and bone marrow cells. They have to be differentiated from adenomas with myelolipomatous metaplasia. Further, rare primary cortical tumours are mentioned.","1988":"The neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are rare, but belong to the most common endocrine neoplasms of the abdomen. In most cases, they show a characteristic macroscopic and microscopic pathology. On the basis of morphological, immunohistological and biological criteria, the WHO classification distinguishes between well differentiated tumors with benign or uncertain behavior, well differentiated (low grade malignant) carcinomas and poorly differentiated (high grade malignant) carcinomas. The functional tumor entities on which the classification is based are briefly described and discussed.","1989":"Pituitary adenomas must be clearly differentiated from other tumors of the sellar region (especially meningiomas, granular cell tumors, chordomas and germinomas), which may look very similar. The sub-classification of adenomas depends on the methods used, in particular the immunostaining for pituitary hormones. This sub-classification is not necessary in every case, but must be performed if unusual findings are observed during surgery or if surgery is unsuccessful and radiation or drug-therapy is planned. Special structures and non-immunohistochemical stainings are very helpful for typing adenomas. We differentiated monohormonal densely or sparsely granulated GH-cell adenomas, monohormonal sparsely or very rarely densely granulated prolactin cell adenomas, monohormonal densely or sparsely ACTH-cell adenomas, monohormonal TSH-cell adenomas and FSH\/LH cell adenomas from bihormonal adenomas of mammosomatotroph or GH\/prolactin cell type or of the acidophil stem cell adenoma type. The number of plurihormonal adenomas decreased with the use of improved monoclonal antibodies. Clinically inactive adenomas are classified as null cell adenomas, oncocytic adenomas or FSH\/LH-cell adenomas. These appear as subtypes of one entity deriving from the gonadotroph cell type. Craniopharyngiomas are classified into adamantinous and papillary types, which are not only structurally but also clinically different. If adamantinous craniopharyngiomas show very strongly regressive changes, immunostaining for keratin may be necessary to identify the squamous epithelia for the demonstration of craniopharyngioma.","1990":"Most space occupying lesions of the sellar region are tumors (e.g., pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, but also meningiomas). In approximately 8% of patients with sellar mass lesions, non-neoplastic disorders (e.g., inflammations, cysts, hyperplasia) are causal. Cystic lesions of the pituitary region are classified as Rathke's cysts, colloid cysts, arachnoidal cysts and epidermoid cysts. These have to be differentiated from cystic craniopharyngeomas or cystic pituitary adenomas. Autochthonous inflammations (lymphocyctic hypophysitis, idiopathic granulomatous hypophysitis, xanthomatous and peritumorous hypophysitis) have to be distinguished from generalized diseases involving the pituitary (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis). Hyperplasia can result in a doubling of pituitary size. Lactotroph and corticotroph hyperplasia are the most common and may be of a diffuse and nodular type. The nodular form of pituitary hyperplasia may show transition into adenoma. Other hyperplasias may be found adjacent to adenomas or other tumours. Furthermore, vascular (aneurysms) and bony lesions (especially fibrous dysplasia) can appear as space occupying lesions of the sellar region.","1991":"Pathology is an image based discipline and therefore well suited for web-based teaching. PathoBasiliensis (http:\/\/www.unibas.ch\/patho\/) is a freely accessible internet site addressing various target groups. The site consists of various complementing and constitutive teaching- and information modules. The image database PathoPic represents the central element of the teaching modules. Based on this database teaching modules and learning games have been and are being developed allowing users to exercise diagnostic skills adapted to the individual learning process. Development and evaluation of the online histopathology course HiPaKu and the game Matching pair are presented.","1992":"During the last 20 years, endoscopic removal of colorectal adenoma has become widely accepted as a replacement for removal by open surgery. Even colorectal adenocarcinomas are not excluded. The key question is when surgical treatment should still be preferred over endoscopic removal as the primary treatment. One good indicator is the frequency of lymph node metastasis, which should be compared with the overall risk involved in the surgical procedure itself. Histological examination allows subdivision of early colorectal adenocarcinomas into low-risk and high-risk groups. Classical parameters for a high-risk situation are lymphatic invasion, poor differentiation, and incomplete removal (R1). Additional risk factors that have recently been discussed are infiltration into the lower third of the submucosal layer (sm3) and dissociation (budding) of the tumour cells at the invasion front. Drawing on the literature and an analysis of our own patients, we demonstrate a positive correlation between these new markers and an elevated risk of the presence of lymph node metastasis.","1993":"Cytological smears of 17 papillary carcinomas (PC) of the thyroid as well as histological slides of 58 PC and 50 follicular adenomas (FA) and 50 follicular carcinomas (FC) were reviewed to assess the presence of intrafollicularly located multinucleated giant cells. In accordance with the data published, such giant cells were found in 70% of PC but in only 8% of FA and FC. The presence of giant cells, which probably represents a foreign body reaction to, in case of PC, physicochemically altered colloid, is a useful additional criteria for the cytological and histological diagnosis of PC.","1994":"Hyperparathyroidism is mainly caused by hyperplasia or adenomas of the parathyroid glands. Formerly, the therapeutic strategy depended on the morphological diagnosis (preferentially already made intraoperatively by examination of frozen sections). Today, however, the extent of parathyroid surgery is in many cases guided both by substantial improvements in the preoperative clinical diagnosis as well as the intraoperatively determined decrease in the serum parathyroid hormone level. Nevertheless, the pathologist should be familiar with the differential diagnostic criteria of parathyroid hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma.","1995":"The vast majority of thyroid tumours are epithelial. In contrast to thyroid adenoma, which is a common tumour, thyroid carcinomas make up only 1% of all human malignancies. Routine pathology is regularly confronted with a differential diagnosis involving thyroid adenoma and carcinoma, as well as particular variants of these tumours. This paper deals with the standardised gross and histological examination, as well as the impact of immunohistochemistry and intraoperative frozen sections on thyroid pathology.","1996":"Hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium (goitre) is the most common morphological change in the thyroid seen by the pathologist. The present paper deals with the aetiology, epidemiology and clinical features of thyroid hyperplasia and its differential diagnosis from thyroid adenoma. Neoplastic hyperplasia of the calcitonin-producing thyroid C cells gives rise to familial medullary carcinoma. The second part of the paper deals with the definition of neoplastic C cell hyperplasia and its discrimination from physiological C cell hyperplasia.","1997":"Inflammation of the thyroid gland makes up approximately 20% of all thyroid diseases. According to the clinical course, thyroiditis has been subdivided into acute, subacute, and chronic forms. Recent classifications are based on the fact that the majority of thyroiditis cases have an autoimmune background. The most common form of this disease is autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), with or without subclinical\/manifest hypothyroidism; less common forms of autoimmune thyroiditis comprise subacute granulomatous (de Quervain's) thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, silent (\"painless\") thyroiditis, and invasive-sclerosing thyroiditis (Riedel's thyroiditis). Non-autoimmune thyroiditis is very rare (acute suppurative thyroiditis, radiation thyroiditis). Thyroiditis is both clinically and morphologically an important differential diagnosis of thyroid tumours. The present paper deals with the epidemiology, clinical course, and morphology of thyroiditis, knowledge of which is essential for the examination of cytological and histological thyroid specimens.","1998":"","1999":"","2000":"The manifestation of a malignant melanoma in the uterus is very rare, more often it is the result of metastasis rather than a primary tumor. A malignant melanoma at this site can originate either from melanocytic elements within the cervical epithelium or from the cervical stroma. We report on two cases of primary malignant melanoma of the uterine cervix and compare them with other cases from the literature.","2001":"We report on a 15-month-old boy presenting a juvenile active ossifying fibroma in the right nasal cavity and the sibling, a 9-month-old girl with a mesenchymal hamartoma of the chest wall. The two lesions showed many similarities. Both lesions are present at the time of birth or in early life with local obstructive or compressive effects. The lesions have a similar mixture of mature and immature mesenchymal tissue with areas of ossification. The entities present a tumor-like development with an abnormal mixture of tissue indigenous to the specific area of the body without notable atypical cytologic features. These features are typical criteria for hamartoma lesions.","2002":"Dysregulation of apoptosis is closely associated with malignant cell transformation. On the other hand, apoptosis is induced by chemotherapy or irradiation. Therefore, in 54 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 36 squamous cell carcinomas, 18 adenocarcinomas, stage IIIA\/IIIB), apoptotic indices were comparatively analysed before onset and after termination of neoadjuvant therapy. The results were compared with the response to neoadjuvant therapy (extent of therapy-induced tumour regression) as well as the survival times. A statistically significant difference could not be established between pre-therapeutically and post-surgically established apoptotic indices (mean values: 0.93% vs. 1.1%). Neither before therapy nor after surgery did the apoptotic indices show a significant predictive value concerning different overall survival times. These results suggest that neoadjuvant therapy does not modify the extent of apoptosis in lung cancer in the long term. Only a few weeks after the completion of the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy this contributes to a net proliferation of the residual tumour tissue which is largely equivalent to that of the untreated tumour.","2003":"Perineuriomas, composed almost exclusively of EMA (epithelial membrane antigen) positive cells, represent a rare and distinct entity in the spectrum of nerve sheath tumours. At present three subtypes, including intraneural and extraneural perineurioma as well as sclerosing perineurioma, can be distinguished; atypical and malignant perineuriomas are extremely uncommon. We analysed the clinicopathological and immunohistochemcial features of 13 cases of cutaneous perineurioma. The neoplasms arose in adult patients (age range from 18 to 71 years) and were seen on the hand (six cases), the thigh (three cases), the lower leg (two cases), the forearm (one case) and in perinasal location (one case). Morphologically, seven neoplasms showed features of dermatofibroma-like perineurioma, four lesions were consistent with sclerosing perineurioma, one cellular lesion resembled a solitary fibrous tumour, and one case was diagnosed as atypical\/malignant cutaneous perineurioma; no local recurrences or tumour progression has been reported so far. The differential diagnosis of various variants of cutaneous perineurioma from other mesenchymal lesions as well as melanocytic and epithelial neoplasms is discussed.","2004":"The decline of the autopsy rate in institutes for pathology in Germany is a reason for growing concern. One reason for the restrained activity in performing autopsies might be uncertainty about the legal position concerning the admissibility of so-called clinical or scientific autopsies. Whereas a legal basis for different kinds of autopsies does exist for quite some time (i.e. code of criminal procedure, epidemic law etc.), such statutory rulings have been lacking for clinical or scientific autopsies. Following Berlin and Bremen, in 2000 Hamburg introduced a law for the regulation of scientific autopsies. This autopsy law differentiates between clinical, medicolegal (not on public prosecutor's order), and anatomical autopsies. It arranges aspects of legality of, consent in, order of, and implementation of the autopsy. A survey among clinical pathologists in Hamburg clarifies the drop in the autopsy rate since the last decades until today. The colleagues were also asked to point out their opinion about the reasons for the dropping autopsy rate and to state their experience with the new autopsy law.","2005":"Most adenomas and carcinomas of small intestine and extrahepatic bile ducts arise in the region of Vater's papilla. In FAP it is the main location for carcinomas after proctocolectomy. In many cases symptoms due to stenosis lead to diagnosis in an early tumor stage. In about 80% curative intended resection is possible. Operability is the most relevant prognostic factor. Inflammatory changes, fibrosis, regeneratory changes after endoscopic manipulation, hyperplasia, preneoplastic lesions close to carcinoma, deeply sited carcinomas under protruded, non-neoplastic duodenal mucosa make the diagnosis difficult on biopsy material. Histologically, intestinal type adenocarcinoma, pancreatobiliary type adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinomas and unusual types can be differentiated. In our own series comprising 45 resected ampullary carcinomas 6 from 10 intestinal type adenocarcinomas, and 4 carcinomas of unusual types expressed the immunohistochemical marker profile of intestinal mucosa (keratin 7-, keratin 20+, MUC2+). 17 from 21 pancreatobiliary type adenocarcinomas, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas, as well as 3 papillary carcinomas showed the immunohistochemical profile of pancreaticobiliary duct mucosa (keratin 7+, keratin 20-, MUC2-). 3 invasive carcinomas which were negative for these markers, showed one of these characteristic marker-combinations in non-invasive adenomatous parts. These findings support the concept of histogenetically different ampullary carcinomas which are developing from the intestinal or from the pancreaticobiliary type mucosa of Vater's papilla. Molecular alterations in ampullary carcinomas are similar to those of colorectal as well as pancreatic carcinomas, although they appear in different frequencies. In future studies molecular alterations in ampullary carcinomas should be correlated closely with the different histologic tumor types. The histologic classification should reflect consequently the histogenesis of ampullary tumors from the two different types of papillary mucosa.","2006":"Whenever biopsy material obtained from endoscopically normal colorectal mucosa reveals the blue haematoxyphilic line between the microvilli of the covering epithelium, the rare condition of intestinal spirochetosis is diagnosed. The classification of the bacteria detected with the aid of special stains (e.g. the Warthin Starry silver stain) and in the electron microscope, continues to be something of a problem. A further point of contention is the question whether this spirochetal infection is of pathological significance or not. A point mitigating against pathogenicity is the fact that no histological signs of an inflammatory reaction are to be seen. Also, the symptoms of patients with intestinal spirochetosis are such that they provide no basis for a pronouncement on whether the infection is of a pathological or a pathological nature. On the other hand, however, a number of studies do seem to indicate that the spirochetes might be the cause of such symptoms as diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain. A point that would appear to support this view is the fact that such symptoms may disappear after successful treatment with metronidazole. The histological diagnosis is easily established when, faced by an apparently normal histological appearance of the colorectal mucosa, the pathologist considers the possibility of spirochetosis, and undertakes a specific search for the blue haematoxyphilic line in the covering epithelium of the colorectal mucosa.","2007":"Recent morphological and molecular genetic findings have greatly expanded our understanding of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). GISTs are now defined by their overexpression of CD117 (KIT), the receptor for the stem cell factor, and can thus be discriminated from smooth muscle tumors. Cytogenetically, GISTs are characterized even in early lesions by frequent entire or partial loss of the chromosomes 14 and 22 and terminal deletions of the chromosomal arm 1p. During tumor progression further chromosomal imbalances accumulate. Following the first report on activating KIT mutations in GISTs, several studies have addressed the role of wild-type and mutant KIT in GISTs and demonstrated activating KIT mutations in the majority of cases. Moreover, KIT tyrosine phosphorylation is even present in KIT mutation-negative GISTs, implicating KIT activation as a central event in the pathogenesis of GISTs. Imatinib (STI571\/Glivec) is a selective inhibitor of BCR\/ABL, PDGFR and KIT receptor-tyrosine kinases. First therapeutic applications of imatinib in patients with progressive GISTs have yielded promising results. This review focuses on the morphological and molecular findings in GISTs which have opened up a new therapeutic perspective.","2008":"The Consensus Conference of Chapel Hill (1994) laid a common base for a standardized classification of vasculitides which, after a pre-existing historical diversity, enabled a comparison of different studies. The criteria for this classification are foremost anatomico-pathological and are based on the caliber of affected blood vessels. In addition the quality of the inflammatory reaction, and the entirety of clinical symptoms, as well as the results of immunological tests are included. Moreover a unified pathogenetic concept is proposed for all types of vasculitis. The diagnosis of vasculitis of large, medium or small vessels is made primarily by biopsies and examination of HE-stained sections. However, overlap of calibers of vessels affected and lack of specificity of inflammatory reaction with individual vasculitis types have to be paid attention to. Immunohistochemical methods are only rarely routinely applied. In contrast the complete clinical picture and the results of immunological laboratory tests (especially AntiNeutrophilCytoplasmicAntibodies, ANCA) play an important role in the differential diagnosis of various vasculitis types. Definitions, clinical findings and pathology of the various types of vasculitis are described. Also mentioned are secondary vasculitides, e.g concurrent to collagen diseases or infections. Not only the diagnosis of vasculitis but also the recognition of the specific type and, last but not least monitoring by histological controls, may be decisive for an optimal therapy.","2009":"","2010":"For an intraoperative frozen section service, the period from surgeon's sample excision to the time of transmitting the diagnosis by the pathologist, should not last longer than 20 min. In a period of 16 months we performed 389 frozen sections by telepathology (298 patients) in our breast cancer center, using the Leica telepathology system (TPS 1.5). In 173 out of the 389 sections, an invasive carcinoma was diagnosed (312 frozen sections with the aim to verify malignancy and 77 to verify a tumor-free retroareolar resection margin). The overall error rate amounted to 7 out of 389 sections (about 2%; false-negative in 5 cases, false-positive in 2 cases) and is equivalent to the error rate without telepathology. The mean time for diagnosis per case was 15 min. For the future, it is desirable that hospitals without their own pathologists also perform frozen sections within an adequate time by using telepathology systems.","2011":"The aetiological spectrum of thoracic aortic aneurysms is extensive. Infectious aneurysms (formerly mycotic aneurysms) constitute only a small percentage of all thoracic aortic aneurysms, they are usually small and often develop as complications of bacterial endocarditis. We report the case of a 39-year-old insulin-dependent diabetic, who developed a leaking aneurysm of the thoracic aorta as a late complication of a knee empyema with subsequent metastatic mediastinitis. Clinical, radiological, biochemical and microbiological data are correlated with histopathological findings. The development of this unusual thoracic aortic aneurysm is shown from impending rupture to successful vascular graft implantation.","2012":"A 27-year-old, previously healthy man with abdominal discomfort was diagnosed with a small gastric tumor of the cardia by means of gastroscopy. Further staging revealed diffuse hepatic metastases and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was grossly increased (7179 micro g\/l). Biopsies taken from the gastric tumor and one of the hepatic metastases revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade 3) with papillary and small solid areas and frequent clear cells. Cytoplasmic hyaline droplets were positive with PAS staining (diastase-resistant). Immunohistochemistry revealed focal tumor cells strongly positive for AFP and there was luminal expression of CEA. The diagnosis of an AFP-producing adenocarcinoma of the stomach was made. In spite of intensive combination chemotherapy the patient succumbed to his disease 3 months after diagnosis. The rare AFP-producing adenocarcinoma of the stomach is characterised by a distinct morphology and immunohistochemistry. A hepatoid differentiation may occur but is not obligatory as this case shows. In differential diagnosis, a metastasising germ cell tumor should be excluded. The prognosis for an AFP-positive adenocarcinoma is poor.","2013":"This case report deals with the case history of a 45-year-old male patient who presented with an unusual case of a central odontogenic fibroma which destroyed and replaced the bone mass of the right maxilla. After clinical examination a biopsy was performed and histopathology was consistent with a central odontogenic fibroma with destructive growth. The treatment plan consisted of a surgical resection of the right maxilla. The histopathological evaluation showed a subtotal destruction of the maxillary bone mass by the odontogenic fibroma. Obvious problems concerning the differential diagnosis of odontogenic fibromas as well as current concepts regarding their exact designation and classification are discussed.","2014":"The existence of malignant mesenchymal tumours with myofibroblastic differentiation (myofibroblastic sarcoma, myofibrosarcoma) is controversially discussed. In the present case report a low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma of the thoracic wall with varying morphological appearance in numerous recurrences over a number of years is described. The varying immunophenotypes of tumour cells with myofibroblastic differentiation suggests that changing of morphological and immunohistochemical phenotypes may occur in tumour cells with myofibroblastic characteristics corresponding to the \"plasticity\" of the myofibroblast. The classification of soft tissue tumours is based on a discernible line of differentiation. If cells of a malignant mesenchymal tumour show characteristic features of myofibroblasts by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, this neoplasm should be classified as a myofibroblastic sarcoma, even if the ultrastructural detection of \"fibronexus\" is not possible.","2015":"We describe the third case world-wide of a chorangiocarcinoma, a tumour with an abnormal trophoblast proliferation in combination with a hypervascular chorangiosis of the villous stroma. The lesion was an incidential finding by a healthy 31-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1 when the pregnancy was terminated at 34 weeks gestation because of fetal distress and intrauterine growth restriction. Hormonal levels were within the normal range. Mother and infant had an uneventful postpartum course. Immunohistochemical studies of the abnormal trophoblasts demonstrated strong immunoreactivity for HCG and in 80% for Ki 67. The semiquantitative expression of angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, bFGF, Ang-1 und Ang-2, PDGF) in the tumour trophoblasts was similar to that seen in the normal villi. The pathogenesis of this tumour with a villous vascular response is curious and unclear. Possibilities include the occurrence of a variant of a chorion carcinoma, the occurrence of a new tumour entity or of two separate lesions, a chorangioma and incidential chorion carcinoma, present together as a \"collision\" tumour. Another possibility is a composition tumour or a reactive lesion of trophoblasts and the villous vascular tree.","2016":"We report on the difficult differential diagnosis of liver involvement in disseminated Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH). Three years after treatment of LCH involving the skull and pelvic bones, an 18-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain and cholestatic liver disease. At this time, liver biopsy showed portal infiltrates which were diagnosed as chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis. Two years later, she was icteric under progredient hepatic failure. A second liver biopsy revealed biliary fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation with destruction of the portal bile ducts. The morphological changes in both liver biopsies could be identified as LCH by immunohistochemical detection of CD1a and S-100-positive Langerhans' cells. Morphological changes and clinical findings in LCH of the liver may resemble primary sclerosing cholangitis or chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis. Therefore, LCH is an important differential diagnosis of chronic destructive cholangitis with cholestatic liver disease, especially in children and young adults. The diagnosis can be verified by S-100 and CD1a immunohistochemistry.","2017":"Dendriform pulmonary ossification (DPO) represents a relatively frequent form of diffuse pulmonary and mostly clinically inapparent bone formation of unknown etiology. An association with other pulmonary diseases, particularly pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, has been suggested. Here we report a female patient with a 15-year history of DPO whereby at the age of 48 an X-ray of the thorax first revealed findings suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. For 9 years the patient suffered from chronic progressive ventilation disorder and after a further 3 years open lung biopsy revealed DPO in conjunction with interstitial fibrosis. After a history of progressive respiratory failure the patient suddenly died of cardiac arrhythmia along with deteriorated cor pulmonale at the age of 71. Autopsy revealed an almost complete ossification of the lungs with an increasing gradient from apex to base. In contrast to previous reports, the DPO of our patient was life-limiting.","2018":"Of a total of 4455 persons with mesotheliomas listed in the German register of mesotheliomas, 72 patients have an academic education in whom exposure to asbestos would not necessarily be assumed at first. Only one patient in this group was female. The tumors were located in the pleura in 94% ( n=68) and in the peritoneum in 6% ( n=4). The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.1 years. The mean survival time was 10.2 months. The epitheloid subtype predominated (57.7%, n=41) followed by the biphasic subtype (33.8%, n=24). Development of the sarcomatoid subtype was the least common (8.5%, n=6). Lung dust analysis provided proof for elevated pulmonary asbestos load in 78.2% of the patients. Work-related or non-work-related exposure to asbestos was cited or at least suspected by 68% ( n=49) of the patients. The mean latency period was 36.8 years. Thus, in those patients with an academic career the majority of mesotheliomas can be considered associated with asbestos.","2019":"The sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF), defined as an entity by Meis-Kindblom et al. in 1995 [15] is now considered to be a variant of fibrosing fibrosarcomas. It is a rare tumor with an intermediate malignant potential leading to local recurrences in one third and to metastases in about 40% of the cases. We report six cases of this entity. At the time of diagnosis two patients of our series already showed metastases in the lungs. The tumors were located in the deep soft tissue and measured between 2.5 and 17 cm. The histology is characterized by small epithelioid cells that are arranged individually or in cords and nests and set typically in a hyaline sclerotic matrix. By immunohistochemistry, all cases were vimentin positive, however EMA positive cells are also possible. The differential diagnosis includes metastases of carcinoma, benign and malignant soft tissue tumors. The distinction of SEF from fibromatosis, fibrous histiocytomas, ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, clear cell sarcomas, epithelioid sarcomas, synovial sarcomas and extraskeletal osteosarcomas is discussed.","2020":"Over a period of approximately 30 years we have compared the frequency of Miner's phthisis in the coal mining areas of Aachen and the Ruhr area of Essen and have investigated a total of approximately 600 lungs with silicosis. In cases of silicosis grades II-III and III we found liquefaction in 36% of the callosities but in cases of silicosis I-II and II in only 4-7%. Liquefaction of callosities, or phthisis atra, was found slightly more often in the Ruhr area than in the area of Aachen. If the liquefied silicotic material is expectorated from the bronchial tubes, a cavern-like cavity develops in the lungs, which clinically can often not be differentiated from a tuberculotic cavern. Sometimes silicotic material is transported via the blood vessels and dust particles could often be found microscopically in the liver, spleen or kidneys. In one patient we found silicotic material coming from the bronchial veins with development of arterial embolisms in peripheral arteries of the extremities and brain. The pathogenesis of callosity liquefaction is a consequence of disruption of the blood supply to the surrounding areas of the callosities. In some cases blood vessels in the centre of the callosities are destroyed so that the patient dies after severe haemoptysis.","2021":"In former times autopsies were the main task of a pathologist and therefore the most frequent source of infection but nowadays cytological and biopsy investigations dominate the pathologist's work. Usually the time interval between the extraction of a specimen, its transport into the laboratory and return of the report is no longer than a few hours. Consequently the staff must often handle unfixed or insufficiently fixed material. This and the occurrence of new infectious diseases, e.g. AIDS and TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies), makes it necessary to analyse and perhaps even change the work in respect to hygiene risks and demands for permanent protection against infection. First of all the risks of infection and the common measures of protection from infections for the staff in biopsy and autopsy departments will be described. Subsequently suggestions to reduce infectious risks in special activities will be presented. The examination of frozen sections or intraoperative biopsy material and the handling of specimens possibly contaminated by HIV and TSE will be considered separately.","2022":"Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have been used to \"bridge\" patients with end-stage heart failure to transplantation. Although several reports have suggested that the native ventricular function recovers after long-term LVAD support, a process called \"reverse remodeling\", the underlying biological mechanisms are still unclear. Various molecular pathways of the human myocardium associated with apoptosis, response to stress, or matrix changes are known to be altered under conditions of heart failure, and some have been shown to be reversibly regulated during left ventricular mechanical support, suggesting that the descriptive term \"reverse remodeling\" is, at least in parts, a reversible mechanism. The reduction of volume and pressure overload with a decrease of ventricular wall stress leading to an improvement of myocardial blood supply under mechanical circulatory assistance, may be one explanation for the molecular myocardial changes and may reflect one possible cause for the phenomenon of \"reverse remodeling\".","2023":"Early in 2000 an interlaboratory trial on immunohistochemistry was held in Germany in which 172 pathologists took part. Each pathologist received one H&amp;E stained and five unstained slides of five different tumors to reach a diagnosis based on immunohistochemical stains. Additionally, the diagnosis-independent staining quality was assessed by using a multi-tissue block. Altogether, 828 diagnoses were made, among which 57% (468) were correct. The individual steps of immunohistochemistry (tentative morphological diagnosis, choice of primary antibodies, technical staining quality, conclusions from the diagnosis and rendering a final diagnosis) were assessed independently. Although each of these steps was correlated to the correct final diagnosis, in the multivariate analysis only the tentative diagnosis, choice of primary antibodies and the conclusions drawn from individual stains were independent factors to reach the correct final diagnosis. In the diagnostic part of the interlaboratory trial, the technical quality of the immunostaining was not an independent variable to reach a correct diagnosis. In contrast, the results of the multi-tissue block proved that the immunohistochemical staining quality has to be standardized to reach reproducible results in defining the estrogen receptor expression as a basis for therapeutic decisions.","2024":"Ossification of lung tissue is a rare phenomenon, which can be found in association with carcinoid tumors of the lung or pulmonary blastomas. Very rarely, ossifications are observed in lung metastases of extrathoracal epithelial tumors. In these cases, the most probable primary focus is a colorectal adenocarcinoma. Our question was, whether ossifications in lung metastases are pathognomonic for colorectal adenocarcinomas and how they can be pathogenetically arranged. A total of 15 lung metastases with ossifications from 5 patients suffering from a colorectal adenocarcinoma were examined by means of immunohistochemistry. Thereby, we found an increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2\/4 and osteonectin in tumor cells, as well as an increased stromatogenous expression of collagen type III. We conclude that there is strong evidence of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma when ossifications in lung metastases are found. In these cases, a common metastatic spread of tumor cells and tumor stroma seems to be probable.","2025":"The treatment of patients with colorectal cancer has changed over the last decades. More and more patients receive combined modality treatments including (preoperative) radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To assess the colorectal cancer specimen after neoadjuvant therapy, the pathologist has to be familiar with the histological features induced by radiochemotherapy. Performing a standardized pathological procedure, different grades of tumour regression can be observed and tumour staging should be standardized using valid and reproducible criteria. These criteria are recommended in the forthcoming TNM classification (6th edition, 2002). In the review, these classification rules will be discussed for rectal cancer.","2026":"Various aspects of the progression and prognosis of colorectal carcinoma have been investigated in numerous publications during recent years. An exact macroscopic and microscopic examination is still of basic importance but different factors of the molecular pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma could be described by immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. Furthermore, they have been evaluated regarding their importance for the course of disease and prognosis and in particular, the different pathways of carcinogenesis and microsatellite instability were included. The detection of micrometastasis was investigated applying mostly molecular genetic methods. Numerous oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and regulators of the cell cycle, markers of proliferation and apoptosis, cell adhesion antigens and angiogenetic factors were characterized with regard to their prognostic potential. In the future, so-called response predictors will presumably gain a certain relevance in the context of neoadjuvant (radiotherapy) chemotherapy. The present review summarizes these results and discusses the future clinical relevance.","2027":"Patterning is a spatial and temporal process by which ordered arrangements of cells and tissue structure are attained. The term is mostly applied to the morphogenesis in developmental pathology, but it can also be useful for the neomorphogenesis in tumor biology. Despite increasing data on the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells, processes of tumor patterning are rarely studied and poorly understood. A fundamental embryonic process of patterning is the embryonic gastrulation and a basic patterning is found in the colonic adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Both processes exhibit distinct nuclear translocation and expression of beta-catenin, which is considered to be a decisive transcriptional regulator. Our recent studies demonstrated striking analogies of patterning and nuclear beta-catenin expression between the colonic adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the steps of gastrulation. The shared patterns are dissociation, reassembly, tubular reconstruction and branching of neoplastic cells in association with nuclear beta-catenin expression. These findings establish patterning as a relevant concept for tumor formation and link the neoplastic morphogenesis with embryogenesis.","2028":"The differential diagnosis between sporadic adenoma and colitis-associated neoplasia is difficult. Clinical, histological and molecular genetic methods are available to recognise a difference between these two entities. The aim of the present analysis was to check known criteria in a large series of patients and 352 patients with ulcerative colitis and concomitant intraepithelial neoplastic lesions [149 adenomas (A), 123 colitis-associated intraepithelial neoplasias (N), 80 carcinomas (K)] were investigated. Clinical history helped to identify patients with sporadic adenoma since patients with colitis-associated neoplastic lesions presented with different data such as age (A: 61.3+\/-13 years, N: 48.4+\/-16.4 years, K: 53.9+\/-16.9 years), duration of disease (A: 6.9+\/-8.1 years, N: 11.9+\/-10 years, K: 13.6+\/-9.6 years), frequency of pancolitis (A: 28.6%, N: 56.3%, K: 48.3%) and frequency of solitary lesions (A: 83.7%, N: 23.1%, K: 51.9%). The differential diagnosis between adenoma and colitis-associated neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis appears to be possible but the diagnosis should only be made in the remission phase. Furthermore the patients need a careful endoscopic and bioptic follow-up. If in doubt one should consider colitis-associated neoplasia especially when there are multiple intraepithelial neoplastic lesions. Long-term follow-up studies are urgently needed.","2029":"There is substantial evidence that allergic reactions exist in the gastrointestinal tract (GI). However, patients with food allergy-related enteropathy pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians because the clinical features are variable, unspecific, occur in other gastrointestinal disorders, and specific diagnostic tools are missing. Several recent studies and reviews have focused on the function of eosinophilic granulocytes in GI disease. The role of eosinophils in the pathophysiology of GI hypersensitivity reactions is poorly defined. However, some findings have been reported that imply an involvement of eosinophils in allergic reactions of the gut. The presumptive histology of allergy-associated colitis in colonic and ileal biopsies is based on prominent pure eosinophilic infiltration of a normal lamina propria, submucosa and epithelium with variable degrees of degranulation. An immunoperoxidase stain for eosinophilic peroxidase is supportive in establishing the diagnosis if suspected. Neutrophils or mononuclear infiltrates are not significantly increased and damage to the intestinal tissue is not prominent. Despite characteristic histologic changes in colonic biopsy specimens, a final diagnosis depends on careful clinical examination and exclusion of several differential diagnoses.","2030":"Intestinal lymphomas are almost exclusively non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) which occur at a slightly lower frequency than those arising in the stomach. Intestinal NHLs differ from nodal lymphomas because they retain some properties of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) from which they arise. The recently proposed WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasias encompasses and defines all the NHLs occurring in the gastrointestinal tract as lymphoma entities. The histopathological diagnosis relies on the combination of morphology and immunohistochemistry, which represents the gold standard. By this means a correct diagnosis can be achieved in the vast majority of cases. If nevertheless diagnostic problems arise, they can usually be managed by a re-biopsy, or in individual cases by molecular studies. At any rate, the pathologist must classify the lymphoma according to the WHO classification and diagnoses such as \"low-grade B-cell lymphoma\" or \"small B-cell lymphoma\" are not acceptable.","2031":"There are a number of difficulties regarding the diagnosis of Barrett's mucosa and the varying grades of neoplasia that may be associated with it. It was therefore the aim of a consensus conference of the \"Working Group for Gastroenterological Pathology within the German Society of Pathology\" to achieve standardization regarding the following issues: definition and diagnostic criteria for Barrett's mucosa and its discrimination from intestinal metaplasia of the cardia, diagnostic criteria for intraepithelial neoplasia, number of biopsies necessary to establish the diagnosis, significance of additional immunohistochemical and\/or molecular biological methods as well as importance of a second opinion in the diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia.","2032":"100 years after Rudolf Virchow's death, we find it necessary to demonstrate the mark his work has left on present day medicine. Curt Froboese wrote 50 years ago: \"To come to know Rudolf Virchow well, it is sufficient to read him\". Therefore the present collection of literal quotations from Virchow tries to show how valid many statements of Virchow still are. His definition of \"health\" precedes the well-known formulation of the World Health Organization. Virchow had a presentiment of molecular pathology, without defining this word, when he ascribed molecular forces to the cell and particularly to the cellular nucleus. As a terminologist he played a guiding role. His linguistic sense enabled him to prematurely find out \"barbarisms\" in medical terminology. At the same time, he also supported an international understanding. In particular the surgeons came to know through Virchow that malignant tumors are also primarily local events to be surgically treated preferably in the early stage. Therefore he requested a population-based statistical survey as developed by the cancer registries today. The legend that Virchow fought against bacteriology is not true. He did not stop in his efforts to differentiate between etiology, germs and the course of infection which presupposes knowledge of the respective cellular phenomena. Summing up it can be said that Virchow still plays an important role in our medical world.","2033":"Niemann-Pick disease is an inherited autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder of sphingolipids that results in an accumulation of sphingomyelin in the cells of the reticulo-histiocyte system due to an enzyme defect. Type B of this disorder is characterised by a late onset and a variable manifestation of clinical symptoms. In the presented case a bone marrow biopsy was performed because of a pancytopenia and splenomegaly. A suspicious histiocyte proliferation was found in the bone marrow, showing typically large macrophages with foamy cytoplasm. Enzymatic analysis of a fibroblast culture confirmed the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease type B, with reduced activity of acid sphingomyelinase. A broad spectrum of disorders is associated with an increase in histiocytic cells within the bone marrow. In particular the differential diagnosis includes typical storage diseases, such as Gaucher's disease, and other metabolic disorders. Furthermore, reactive conditions with secondary increase in bone marrow macrophages have to be considered. In accordance with the presented patient the most common causes of histiocytic disorders involving the bone marrow are reviewed.","2034":"In 1986 we diagnosed chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) in a 45-year-old asymptomatic patient with hepatosplenomegaly. In 1996 splenectomy was performed because of hypersplenism, and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was initiated. In 1999 generalised lymphadenopathy of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) developed. A trephine biopsy showed leukaemic bone marrow infiltration. On heteroduplex analysis we found a clonal rearrangement of IgH in the leukaemic lymphocytes. The coincidence of chronic myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases in the same patient is a rare phenomenon. According to the relevant literature, seven cases with a combination of CIMF\/CLL have been reported. Possible pathomechanisms for the development of such coincidences are: 1) a bilineage manifestation of a pluripotent stem cell proliferation, 2) independent proliferations of two distinct cell lines under a common leukaemogenic stimulus or 3) an accidental association. These coincidence cases often showed a mild clinical course and also in our case, the patient is still alive and in a stable disease condition 16 years after the initial diagnosis.","2035":"The important role of angiogenesis for invasion, tumor growth, metastasis and progression of solid tumors is well established. Only recently, the clinical significance of neovascularization in hematological neoplasms has come into the focus of scientific efforts. Emerging data from these studies suggest that the vascular architecture exerts a pivotal role in acute leukemias and multiple myeloma as well as myeloproliferative disorders. Thus, angiogenesis seems to maintain a general condition for malignant growth and the progression of hematological diseases. However, a major shortcoming is that most of the previous studies include only a simple quantitative evaluation of the microvessel density, and applied methods which were developed primarily for the characterization of angiogenesis in solid tumors. In this context it should not be overlooked that solid neoplasms and the bone marrow reveal significant differences regarding the vascular structures and the distribution of microvessels. Therefore, the usually applied, so-called hot-spot techniques, should be amended by an appropriate and more elaborate computer-assisted morphometric analysis of the microvessel structures. This additional spectrum of information regarding quantity and quality of angiogenesis, enables a further understanding of the morphological changes in the course of diseases, and in particular the effect of various therapies on bone marrow vascularization.","2036":"Granulomas are an infrequent finding in bone marrow biopsies and may be associated with a broad spectrum of infectious and non-infectious disorders. In this context sarcoidosis generally reveals the highest incidence of such bone marrow lesions. Other granulomas may be encountered in drug-induced secondary changes (toxic myelopathy) and in particular also in HIV myelopathy. In these cases the granulomas are small, ill-defined and difficult to recognize. Special staining methods are required to detect microorganisms. Fibrin ring granulomas (doughnut granulomas) are typical for Q-fever, but may also be seen in reactive conditions, after drug therapy and in the course of other infectious disorders, such as Lyme disease. Therefore a broad serological testing should be performed. In conclusion, in most cases the morphological findings in the bone marrow are not specific so that a synoptical approach regarding histological, clinical and serological data is warranted to reach the correct diagnosis.","2037":"Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells have been defined as cells with extensive self-renewal capacity and lympho-hematopoietic differentiation potential. Clonal selection of a stem cell as a first step in the progression to neoplasia can be achieved by an alteration of this self-renewal potency. Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorders including acute myeloid leukemias, chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), is based on the assumption that they represent a clonal disorder resulting from transformation of a hematopoietic stem cell. However, when performing methods for determining X-chromosome inactivation in female patients as a clonality marker, a significant minority of the patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph(-)) CMPD and MDS exhibit polyclonal proliferation. The implications of these results are not yet clarified and the lack of a proven target cell impairs the understanding of the underlying molecular defect. In this context, altered response to cytokine stimulation in vitro provides indirect information concerning molecular dysregulation. A subset of patients with MPD present with translocations that facilitate molecular investigation and clonality proof. They nearly always result in rearrangements of at least one transcription factor gene. Most of these fusion genes are constitutively active, sending out continuous proliferative and antiapoptotic signals or activate an overlapping set of signalling pathways. The classical example for a balanced translocation is the t(9;22) bcr-abl aberration in chronic myelogeneous leukemia. Many other karyotypic abnormalities have also been associated with CMPD and MDS and involve deletions of chromosomes 20q, 13q, 1q, 7q and 5q as well as trisomy of 8 and 9. Our increased understanding of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and the molecular basis of regulation of its self-renewal and differentiation bears a direct impact on our understanding of leukemia evolution and progression.","2038":"The spectrum of Philadelphia-chromosome negative leukemoid disorders displays a large heterogeneity of clinical and morphological findings at presentation. According to the FAB guidelines as well as the WHO classification, independent subtypes with different morphological features can be distinguished. In particular, based on the degree of dysgranulopoiesis, the extent of monocytosis, basophilia and the amount of immature and mature granulocytes in the peripheral blood and the percentage of erythroblasts, most of these cases can be correctly classified as either atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). An increase in immature and dysplastic granulocytes in the blood films at presentation accompanied by granulocytic dysplasia, is the most important diagnostic parameter of aCML. On the other hand, CMML is characterized by absolute monocytosis and, as explicitly outlined by the WHO classification, may show myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features. However, in the absence of characteristic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities for both diseases, a minority of patients still remain who are difficult to assign to a distinctive entity, since they either show overlapping features or do not fulfill the whole set of diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, controversy and discussion arise about aCML with monocytosis and its association to CMML. Finally, leukemoid reactions and the very rarely encountered chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) should be considered in patients with chronic leukocytosis. In conclusion, careful morphological analysis of bone marrow histology as well as peripheral blood films and bone marrow smears, enables the identification of patients with different prognosis and therapeutic response.","2039":"Staging biopsies of the bone marrow in lymphoma patients are among the most important indications and therefore of substantial practical importance. Occasionally it is the only organ infiltrated, and therefore a bone marrow biopsy is the prime diagnostic choice in cases of leukemic lymphomas. A synoptical diagnostic approach relying on immunophenotypic as well as on molecular biological criteria aside from histomorphology (cytomorphology), is of utmost importance for the subtyping of malignant lymphomas. This too can be done reliably on bone marrow biopsies, as comparative studies have yielded a concordance rate of more than 90% with lymphoma typing on corresponding lymph nodes. Cytology and the pattern of infiltrates, (i.e. diffuse, interstitial, nodular peritrabecular and intrasinusoidal), in combination with immunological phenotyping are the mainstays for subtyping, giving clear-cut decisions in most cases of small B-cell lymphoma, mantle zone as well as marginal cell and follicular lymphomas and hairy cell leukemia. Among the blastic variants the most important are the lymphoblastic lymphomas of either B- or T-cell type which have to be discerned from AML and the so-called blastoid mantle cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphomas are rare compared to B-cell lymphomas. Among the rarely seen T-cell neoplasias the lymphoma of large granular lymphocytes is the dominating lymphoma, which in most cases can only be diagnosed reliably by molecular biological means, followed by T-CLL, Sezary's syndrome and hepatosplenic chi delta lymphoma.","2040":"Overt myelofibrosis in bone marrow biopsies as a diagnostic postulate in cIMF has been discarded only recently by the WHO. Therefore, only a few studies have been performed on the evolution of myelofibrosis in \"prefibrotic\" cIMF by means of sequential bone marrow biopsies. We carried out this study on 38 patients, split up into two groups, A and B according to treatment modalities, to evaluate the dynamics and frequency of myelofibrosis in both groups. Our results indicate a step-wise development of myelofibrosis from a \"prefibrotic\" to a \"classical\" cIMF, as 75-80% of the respective patients in both groups progressed to myelofibrosis. However, this evolution seems to be heterogeneous and unpredictable in individual patients, since myelofibrosis could be seen as early as less than 2 years after diagnosis in 12\/38 (31.6%) patients, whereas 3 patients remained \"prefibrotic\" even after up to 6 years of follow-up.","2041":"Thrombocythemia in the course of chronic myeloproliferative disorders like chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (cIMF) and of course essential thrombocythemia (ET), are characterized by life-threatening complications. In a number of clinical trials the recently introduced drug Agrylin((R)) has proven to be very effective. The normalization of the platelet count was related to an interference with megakaryocyte maturation leading to a left-shifting of this cell lineage and\/or a reduced proliferation. However, until now no systematic study has been performed on the relationship between development of megakaryopoiesis and proliferative activity. In this investigation we included 10 patients with cIMF and 5 patients with ET that had received Agrylin((R)) for a period ranging between 6 and 70 months. Following therapy this cohort revealed a decrease in the platelet count from 1,104x10(9)\/l at diagnosis to 485x10(9)\/l. In this context we focused on an immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis of the CD61(+) megakaryopoiesis involving also endomitotic reduplication, by applying a double-immune incubation technique with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Moreover, we determined the changes of fiber density during observation time. According to our results, the thrombocytopenic effect of Agrylin((R)) is based on an arrest in the dynamics of megakaryocyte maturation towards large (mature) platelet-shedding (polyploid) cells. This pathomechanism causes a significant increase in the number of promegakaryoblasts and megakaryoblasts. On the other hand, the total amount of CD61(+) megakaryocytic cells is not increased. Related to the peculiar cell biology of endomitotic reduplication during the maturation process and its different periods alloted to each single step, PCNA activity (late G1- and S-phase of the cell cycle) is found to be enhanced in the megakaryocyte precursors. Finally, no significant influence of Agrylin((R)) on the evolution of myelofibrosis is detectable and there is a general improvement of hematological data especially in cIMF.","2042":"The diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) is based on the evidence of an autonomous, clonal proliferation of eosinophilic precursors and the exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia. Histopathological evaluations of bone marrow are rare, and reliable data on the frequency of CEL do not yet exist. A total of 100 cases characterized by eosinophilia &gt;\/=1.5x10(9)\/l blood for more than 6 months were evaluated. In 87 cases, the eosinophilia turned out to be secondary and a reactive genesis was likely, but not proven in 3 further cases. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome was diagnosed in three cases. The diagnosis CEL was considered in four out of a total of seven cases with a myeloid neoplasia and all four disorders showed an abnormal karyotype. However, only one of them could be classified as CEL. We conclude that CEL is a rare disease concerning only a minority of cases with chronic eosinophilia.","2043":"Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL) is a rare BCR\/ABL negative myeloproliferative disorder of elderly patients, showing sustained neutrophilia and splenomegaly. Differentiation between CNL and leukaemoid reactions (LR) is problematic since both conditions share similar morphological features but is essential because CNL patients generally have a poor prognosis. We studied blood samples from 10 female patients with CNL or LR using the HUMARA assay to determine clonality patterns in neutrophils. T-lymphocytes of the patients were investigated as an internal control cell population. In all five CNL patients the neutrophils, and in four of them also T-lymphocytes were monoclonal, indicating that the latter may also originate from the neoplastic clone. In LR patients the neutrophils and T-lymphocytes were generally polyclonal except in one patient showing monoclonal neutrophils suggesting that this patient might be in the process of developing a myeloproliferative disorder. In females clonality studies of blood neutrophils using HUMARA aid in distinguishing patients with monoclonal CNL from polyclonal LR.","2044":"The results of a number of animal experimental studies are in keeping with the finding that hematopoietic progenitors can generate cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. As a consequence innovative therapeutic strategies have been suggested to possibly ameliorate the outcome of coronary artery disease. However, there is no information available at present whether this pathomechanism is also effective in humans, in particular without prior ischemic lesion of the myocardium. Therefore an autopsy study was performed on cadaver hearts derived from five male patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who received full unmanipulated bone marrow grafts from female donors 21-631 days before death. The purpose of this investigation was to detect and quantify a putative chimerism of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells (intramural and subepicardial vessels). Genotyping was carried out by applying X- or Y-chromosome-specific DNA probes (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation) on routinely formalin-fixed specimens of the myocardium. To test the sensitivity of our method, cadaver hearts from two males and two females without a history of transplantation served as controls. In contrast to a totally corresponding sex-matched genotyping in 780 cardiomyocytes and 155 endothelial cells of the control group, the five male patients with a previous transplantation revealed significantly different results. A mixed chimerism was identifiable in 57 out of 890 counted cardiomyocytes (6.4%) and in 19 out of 322 endothelial cells (5.8%). These findings support the assumption that in addition to endothelial cells there is also a cardiomyogenic potential of bone marrow stem cells which exists without prior (ischemic) damage to the heart. However, further investigations are necessary to identify, isolate and enrich the cardiomyocytic stem cells more specifically for future curative therapeutic options in patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy.","2045":"Extramedullary myeloblastic tumors, so-called myelosarcomas (granulocytic sarcomas, chloromas) have been reported only sporadically in the pertinent literature which reflects their rather infrequent occurrence. These lesions may accompany the initial manifestation or signal relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or coincide with blastic transformation of a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. However, even more rarely, primary myelosarcomas may precede AML by months or years or may be associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that never progress to manifest leukemia. In a retrospective evaluation a clinicopathological study on these latter two variants of isolated extramedullary manifestations of AML was performed to elucidate certain aspects of site involvement and histopathology by application of enzyme and immunohistochemistry. For this reason, we selected 6 patients presenting with a myelosarcoma in combination with MDS and 12 patients revealing only uncharacteristic reactive changes of the bone marrow. Of these patients 8 developed AML following an observation time of up to 2 years. Focal leukemic infiltrates were most often localized in the skin ( n=4), oral mucosa ( n=4), lymph nodes ( n=3), gastrointestinal tract ( n=3) or pleura and retroperitoneum ( n=3 each). Myelosarcomas were usually regarded by the clinicians as putative malignant lymphomas unless further evaluation, especially involving chloroacetate esterase reactions as well as immunostaining with a panel of antibodies reactive with lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, CD68, CD43, CD56, CD117 and CD34 proved their true nature. Although at that time bone marrow findings were inconclusive, a straightforward diagnosis was reached by considering the possibility of a (primary) myelosarcoma in these patients.","2046":"We describe an unusual type of cellular chorangioma with a high rate of proliferating cells and mitosis and high expression of the growth factor BFGF. The tumor was observed in the placenta of a 26-year-old gravida 1 with help syndrome. The pregnancy was terminated at 35+5 weeks by elective caesarean section. Chorangiomas are hamartoma malformations of the placenta which in some cases may be large enough to influence the course of pregnancy and associated complications are hydramnion, gestosis or hemorrhage. Complications for the fetus are due to hemodynamic alterations caused by the formation of an arteriovenous shunt. Because the histogenesis of the tumor is still unknown, we examined the expression of the growth factors VEGF and BFGF. The number of cells with an expression of VEGF in placental tissue and in the chorangioma was uniform, but the number of cells with an expression of BFGF was much higher in the chorangioma than in the placenta. We conclude that BFGF may have an influence on the growth of chorangiomas. There was no difference between the chorangioma and the placenta in the rate of apoptosis-inhibited cells.","2047":"PVP had been used as a plasma expander following the end of world war II up to relatively recently but after its intracellular storage became known, it was withdrawn from use. Nevertheless, it was used as a retarding agent for subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of drugs until the 1980s and as a consequence pseudotumors have been observed. Three patients from the former USSR are described with PVP storage in the gastric and duodenal mucosa as well as in lymph nodes. The reason for the administration in these patients and the substances applied remain obscure. It is known that PVP infusions are still performed in Taiwan and that it was also injected intraarticularly as an artificial joint lubricant in Russia in the early 1990s. Because cells with intracytoplasmic deposits of PVP can be misdiagnosed as tumor cells and for reasons of general health - \"la maladie polyvinylique\" [1] may develop - it is still necessary to retain knowledge of the histology of cellular PVP storage.","2048":"The scientific investigation of mummies and skeletons provides considerable data for the reconstruction of the living conditions and diseases of past populations. We describe the data on four completely analyzed tomb complexes from the huge necropolis of Thebes-West in Upper Egypt dating to different time periods. A total of 211 individuals from the so-called \"Middle Kingdom\" (MK, c. 2050-1750 BC) were compared to 273 individuals from the \"New Kingdom\" (NK) to \"Late Period\" (LP, in total 1550-500 BC). The age at death and the sex ratio were comparable between both groups. There was a high rate of early death with a maximum between the 2nd and 3rd decade of life but infant\/adolescent burials were comparably rare. This early death is assumed to be due to an elevated prevalence of various infectious diseases. Likewise, a high rate of tuberculosis infections was seen in those individuals regardless of which time period they came from. Metabolic disorders with osseous manifestations, such as scurvy, osteomalacia and chronic anemia (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis) were found with a high frequency in the MK populations but significantly less in the NK-LP populations. On the other hand signs of trauma were comparably high, and lesions due to degenerative joint and vertebral diseases were significantly higher in LP than in MK or NK individuals suggesting a higher mechanical load in the later populations. Cases of malignant (secondary) bone tumors and various soft tissue\/organ diseases indicate that \"civilization\" disorders were present when the living conditions assured survival into advanced age. In summary, we provide circumstantial evidence that the systematic and concise analysis of mummy and skeletal remains can allow a reconstruction of major aspects of life and disease in historic populations, although a complete reconstruction is not possible.","2049":"Aseptic loosening of hip arthroplasties are the main reason for revision operations. Basic research indicates a significant relevance of the interface membrane formed between the implant an the surrounding bone. Their cellular composition and the influence of various factors on the process of aseptic loosening has attracted scientific interest. Cytokines are essential for intracellular communication. Is it possible to reveal differences in the expression profile of cytokines between well-fixed and failed hip arthroplasties using the cDNA array approach? AIM. Generation of a cytokine expression profile characteristic for failed hip arthroplasty. Radioactively labeled cDNA probes were synthesised from mRNA isolated from the interface membrane of six patients with aseptic loosened hip arthroplasty. Using a phosphorimager the analysis of the cDNA arrays revealed nine cytokines which were overexpressed compared with the reference tissue (Calgranulin A, Calgranulin B, IL-10, MCP-1, RANTES, TFDG1, TNFR2, RAI, THYB10). In this study four out of these nine cytokines were found to be connected with the process of aseptic loosening for the first time. ","2050":"STAND: Light microscopic investigation of histologic and grinding sections indicates structural differences by resorption lacunae and perforations Is it possible to characterize different types of resorption lacunae and perforations on the basis of ultrastructural differences within them? AIM. Morphological characterization of resorption lacunae and perforations in cancellous bone of the human femoral head Samples from the femoral head of 28 patients without skeletal diseases were macerated, dried, gold sputtered and analysed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS. We were able to distinguish two types of resorptions lacunae as well as two types of perforation: The longitudinal extended resorption (LER), the reticulate patched resorption (RPR), the lacunar perforation (LP), the tunneling perforation (TP). Moreover we demarcate perforations from blood vessel canals. The differentiated types of resorption lacunae and perforations suggest the influence of local factors which regulates osteoclastic activity or indicate different subspecies of osteoclasts. ","2051":"Expression analysis of the protein tyrosine kinases, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase2 (Pyk2) in high grade osteosarcomas. Expression of the kinases was evaluated qualitatively by immunohistochemical staining and quantitatively by real-time PCR. Osteoblastic cells of high grade osteosarcomas show a distinct FAK expression but an overexpression at the transcriptional level could not be detected. The Pyk2-mRNA expression was decreased in osteosarcomas. An altered relationship of FAK and Pyk2 was observed for different tumors and could also be important for osteosarcoma development. ","2052":"Mazabraud's syndrome is a rare, sporadic disorder characterised by the association of mainly polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and intramuscular myxoma. Fibrous dysplasia is mostly diagnosed at a younger age, while myxomas only occur during adulthood. We report a case of a 42-year-old female with Mazabraud's syndrome where a polyostotic fibrous dysplasia was already diagnosed and at presentation two newly formed intramuscular myxomas were found in the gluteal muscle.","2053":"The observations in 222 cases of fibrous dysplasia of the Hamburg Bone Tumor Registry will be presented. This benign lesion is based on the appearance of postzygotic point mutations in a gene encoding the Gsa protein. It occurs as a mono- and a polyostotic variant and may affect every bone of the skeleton. Most often affected are the proximal femur, the skull and the ribs. Polyostotic lesions tend to occur on one side of the body. The monostotic form is 7.6 times more frequent, but both variants show no predilection for gender. Most cases are diagnosed during adulthood. On x-rays the lesion has a ground-glass appearance and is located intramedullary with a sharply defined edge. The cortical bone is arroded and the bone is expanded. Histologically typical signs are slender curved fibrous trabeculae with a C and Y shape embedded in a morphologically bland and moderately cellular fibrous stroma. Diagnostically important are collagen fibres emerging perpendicular from the surface of the trabeculae. Cartilage is present in 8% of the cases. Therapeutically, thorough clinical controls are indicated and operative procedures are rarely needed to prevent progressive deformities and fractures. The formerly applied radiotherapy is now obsolete because of the increased occurrence of malignant transformations.","2054":"Giant cell-rich bone lesions consist of tumor-like lesions and true neoplastic giant cell tumors. In this study it was investigated whether DNA cytometry may contribute to the differential diagnosis between aneurysmal bone cysts and giant cell tumors. Statistically significant differences in the frequency of tetraploid stemlines were detected. Nevertheless, the knowledge of age, localization and radiological signs in addition to morphological findings are essential to distinguish between these lesions.","2055":"The giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is a local osteolytic tumor with variable degrees of aggressiveness. In rare cases pulmonary metastases can be observed. The lesion most frequently occurs in the epiphysis of long tubular bones of the knee region, predominantly affecting young adults after closure of the growth plate. The characteristic histological appearance of GCT displays a high number of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, which resulted in the classification \"osteoclastoma\" or \"giant cell tumor\". Apart from the multinucleated giant cells, there are two mononuclear cell types in the GCT. The first one has a round morphology and resembles a monocyte. The second cell type is the spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like stromal cell. Cell culture experiments with GCT cells revealed the stromal cell to be the proliferating component of the GCT. The other two cell types, the monocyte and the multinucleated giant cell, were lost after a few cell culture passages. Furthermore, latest results from GCT reveal that the stromal cells secrete a variety of cytokines and differentiation factors, including MCP1, ODF and M-CSF. These molecules are monocyte chemoattractants and are essential for osteoclast differentiation, suggesting that the stromal cell stimulates blood monocyte immigration into tumor tissue and enhances their fusion into osteoclast-like, multinucleated giant cells. The multinucleated giant cell itself demonstrates properties of a normal osteoclast that is able to resorb bone leading to extended osteolysis. This new model of GCT genesis supports the hypothesis that the stromal cell is the neoplastic component whilst the monocytes and the multinucleated giant cells are just a reactive component of this tumor. Taking this into consideration, the nomenclature of the \"giant cell tumor\" needs to be reconsidered.","2056":"In a pilot project of the Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg and the Orthopaedic Department of the University of Heidelberg, the cases of 121 patients with suspicion of a primary bone tumour have been discussed at weekly interdisciplinary conferences during the period from July 2001 to May 2002., The consequent differential diagnoses were made prior to the biopsy, the optimal location of the biopsy and the further strategy was determined according to the guidelines of the international bone tumour centres. The latter includes the decision if a conventional biopsy or a intraoperative pathology examination on frozen sections should be performed. In 27 cases an intraoperative pathology examination was performed and then assessed in Hamburg. In 24 cases this diagnosis was identical with the final diagnosis. In three cases no definitive diagnosis could be made from the frozen sections. Additionally the pathohistological diagnoses of the cases of the previous week have been discussed in the video-conferences. Through this a unusually close interdisciplinary cooperation over a large distance has evolved, that is highly appreciated especially by the young and less experienced colleagues at the department of bone pathology and the orthopaedic department in Heidelberg. The awareness of the potential and limitations of a medical subject leads to an improved safety in the diagnostic process for bone tumours. The interdisciplinary discussion of all aspects of the diseases may also optimise the therapy of bone tumours.","2057":"Prion diseases are rare neurodegenerative transmissible fatal diseases affecting humans and mammals. The causative agent is a novel pathogen termed the prion. Unlike classical infectious agents such as bacteria or viruses, prions lack an independent genome and consist largely of an abnormal form of the host-encoded prion protein. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the main representative of human prion diseases that may be sporadic in most cases, hereditary, or acquired. Clinical examination yields only a suspected diagnosis with formal criteria for probable or possible. Definite diagnosis relies on autopsy and neuropathology findings. This is also true for the new variant CJD (vCJD), a previously unknown prion disease of humans that is connected with the same strain of prions as found in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The autopsy and handling of laboratory material for histopathological examination requires specific precautionary measures and decontamination. For definite histopathological diagnosis of a human prion disease, immunohistochemical detection of the prion protein deposits is the gold standard. Furthermore, molecular and genetic investigations are necessary for classification because a close correlation could be established between distinct CJD phenotypes, codon 129 genotypes of the prion protein gene, and the prion protein type.","2058":"Rhabdomyolysis is one of the less known complications of heroin abuse. A case of lower leg muscle necrosis after nasal application of heroin is reported with repeated resection of the necrotic muscles. Superinfection with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain was present. After 4 weeks, bilateral amputation could not be avoided. We regard a direct toxic effect of the heroin as the most probable mechanism of the muscular damage, with possible influence of the reduced oxygen delivery due to central respiratory and circulatory depression.","2059":"Although carcinoma cuniculatum clinically appears to be malignant, histological evaluation often results in a false diagnosis of a benign papillomatous lesion or pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, because the tumor usually displays a well differentiated tissue. In this report morphological and immunohistological features in a rare case of carcinoma cuniculatum of the oral cavity are described. Both clinical features and histomorphological evaluation must be taken into consideration when diagnosing the tumor.","2060":"","2061":"Metanephric adenoma of the kidney is a well described tumor entity. The differential diagnosis between papillary adenoma or papillary carcinoma type 1 and metanephric adenoma of the kidney can be challenging in single cases. We report two cases of metanephric adenomas and compare their immunophenotype with a papillary adenoma. The analysis of these metanephric adenomas and a review of the literature shows that CD-57 positivity and lack of EMA expression are helpful in distinguishing metanephric adenoma from papillary adenoma and papillary carcinoma. Glomeruloid structures, Psammoma bodies, necrosis or expression of cytokeratin 7 and vimentin are common features in metanephric adenoma and papillary adenoma or papillary carcinoma. The knowledge of the immunohistochemical constellation is important, because metanephric adenoma can be very large and often have some necrosis.","2062":"Of the numerous morphological variants of meningiomas only few, and among these the rhabdoid meningioma, have prognostic importance. Rhabdoid meningiomas were described for the first time in 1998 as an unusual variant with increased proliferative activity. In 2000 they have been included in the revised WHO classification of tumours of the CNS as a subtype of meningiomas with increased risk of recurrence and more aggressive growth, corresponding to WHO grade III. We report the case of a rhabdoid meningioma in a 21-year-old woman presenting as a intracerebral tumour mimicking an oligodendroglioma. The tumour showed features of a meningioma and a rhabdoid morphology with angiomatous components and was considered to be a rhabdoid meningioma. After surgery a small residual tumour remained. The patient received postoperative radiotherapy resulting in regression of the residual tumour in control examinations after 4 and 8 months. Using the presented case we discuss the differential diagnosis and prognostic significance of recognition of a rhabdoid meningioma.","2063":"Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is used as an immunohistochemical marker for the identification of the lungs or thyroid gland as the site of origin in patients with metastatic disease and unknown primary tumor. In this study the reliability of anti-TTF-1 was assessed in 65 metastases of the central nervous system (CNS), among which there were also small stereotactic biopsies (n = 22) and poorly preserved specimens. Eight out of nine CNS metastases of patients with known adenocarcinoma of the lungs, as well as seven adenocarcinoma metastases of patients with radiologically detected or anamnestically presumed pulmonary carcinoma, expressed TTF-1 immunohistochemically. One CNS metastasis from a follicular thyroid carcinoma was positive and one from an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was negative. All CNS metastases from patients with known primary tumors outside the lungs or thyroid gland were negative. TTF-1 is a sensitive (up to 90%) and specific (100%) immunohistochemical marker for CNS metastases of adenocarcinomas of the lungs and also functions reliably on small or stereotactic biopsies and poorly preserved samples.","2064":"Diagnostically primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) have to be differentiated from glioblastoma and brain metastases. Histologically the overwhelming majority of PCNSL is represented by diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, in this series with a BCL6 expression in 80% of the cases detected by immunohistochemistry. Stereotactic biopsy is the method of choice in establishing the definite diagnosis and intraoperative smear cytology will detect the lymphoid blasts. To confirm the B-cell lineage, immunohistochemistry is needed (CD20, CD79a). Small reactive T-lymphocytes and monohistiocytic cells and activated \"microglia\" are found within and at the periphery of PCNSL foci. The infiltrated brain tissue shows partially pleomorphic reactive astrocytes that can be confused with neoplastic astrocytes, especially in small specimens. In contrast to high-grade gliomas, however, PCNSLs do not show endothelial proliferations. Subtypes or variants of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas can also be observed in cases of PCNSL: the anaplastic variant with large multinucleated tumour cells resembling Reed-Sternberg cells, T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma and intravascular B-cell lymphoma with primary manifestation within the brain or the spinal cord. HIV\/AIDS-associated PCNSLs are characterised by large plasmoblastic or small Burkitt-like cells and tumour necrosis. Primary leptomeningeal large B-cell lymphomas do occur very rarely and are diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid cytology.","2065":"New developments in neuro-oncology have prompted an update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the nervous system. Major changes include the addition of new entities and the refinement of criteria for the diagnosis and grading of various neoplasms, in particular the meningiomas. As novel clinico-pathological entities, the chordoid glioma of the third ventricle, the atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor (AT\/RT), the solitary fibrous tumor, and the perineurioma have been listed. The former lipomatous medulloblastoma of the cerebellum, previously incorporated in the family of embryonal tumors, is now classified as cerebellar liponeurocytoma. The term mixed pineocytoma\/pineoblastoma has been replaced by pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation. Furthermore, the large cell medulloblastoma and the tanycytic ependymoma were established as novel tumor variants. A separate chapter on the peripheral neuroblastic tumors has now been included in the classification. Substantial revisions were introduced in the meningioma chapter. For both atypical meningioma WHO grade II and anaplastic meningioma WHO grade III, histopathological criteria are now precisely defined. An important new addition to the WHO 2000 classification of nervous system tumors is the inclusion of molecular pathology findings. With this combination of pathology and genetics it has set the stage for a new format of the WHO tumor classification series.","2066":"To detect a possible correlation between the neurology and duration of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and cerebral pathology, we studied 22 autopsy cases by histological and immunohistochemical methods. The duration of disease ranged between 1 and 15 months with an average of 5.2 months. Only in 11 cases was the EEG typical for CJD. Morphologically the changes varied from minimal spongy changes to severe neuronal loss and brain atrophy. For the three cortical regions examined semiquantitatively, there was no correlation between the severity of spongiform changes and the duration of disease or the pattern of neurological symptoms. The study shows that more extensive sampling for the detection of regional heterogeneity of changes is mandatory in spongiform encephalopathies, and that complicating changes such as intermittent infections may play a role for the survival time as well. Moreover, genetic determinants, prion protein polymorphisms and the mode of exposure have to be considered as possible modulating factors.","2067":"","2068":"Adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) is a rare genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. The disease is caused by mutations of the gene coding for the glycogen-branching enzyme, which is essential for branching of polyglucose chains in the normal glycogen molecule. The age of clinical manifestation of the disease mostly is between 40 and 60 years and its course is slowly progressive. Characteristic globular deposits (polyglucosan bodies, PGB) can be detected in biopsies of skin and skeletal muscle as well as in the peripheral and central nervous system. Biochemically, PGBs consist of poorly branched glycogen molecules with abnormally long polysaccharide chains. We report the case of a 50-year-old female patient with APBD who suffered from neurological symptoms such as spastic tetraparesis, urinary incontinence, hypesthesia and dementia. She died unexpectedly of cardiac failure. At autopsy a severe cardiomyopathy with abundant PGBs in the heart muscle fibres could be proven as the cause of death. This observation shows that in addition to the known deposition of PGBs in nervous system and skeletal muscle, an involvement of the heart has to be considered in APBD as well.","2069":"The spine is the central component for the mobility of the human body. Both locally limited and diffuse pathologies of the spine are a challenge for the treating physician due to the difficult anatomy. The biopsy of a pathologically altered vertebral body is a fast and reliable basis for further therapy but until now this has not regularly been made use of as a diagnostic standard for spinal diseases, since the tissue gained was often microfractured because of the difficult anatomical position. Our own experience with transpedicular vertebral biopsies of 70 patients with different diseases is reported because of the considerable improvement in the biopsy technique and the methodical possibilities for processing the bony tissue. Methods which have proven particularly valuable are contact radiographs, embedding in plastic, careful decalcifying with EDTA and immunohistological procedures. In this way a definite diagnosis can be made in 97% of the cases. A close cooperation with the clinician carrying out the biopsy and a greater use of methods other than just fast decalcification is recommended.","2070":"The current WHO classification of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) generally distinguishes the relatively rare variant (approximately 5% of all cases of HL) of nodular lymphocyte predominant type from a second group, which comprises classical HL and is separated into four subtypes: lymphocyte rich type, nodular sclerosis type, mixed cellularity type and lymphocyte depleted type. The classical lymphocyte rich subtype is a new entity and based on the typical morphology, can be recognized by definition only by the immunohistochemical characteristics of the Hodgkin and Reed\/Sternberg cells (HRS) (CD30+, CD15+, CD20-). Molecular single cell studies are consistent with the dichotomy of HL in nodular lymphocyte predominant and classical types and stress the exceptional position of the former, which shows similarities with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in several aspects. On the molecular biology level the tumor cells of all kinds of HL turn out to be clonal B cells derived from germinal center cells. However, tumor cells of nodular lymphocyte predominant HL differ from those of classical HL by the pattern of somatic mutations. Considering the inability of HRS cells of classical HL to express a B cell receptor, they should perish under normal conditions. However, they escape from apoptosis by mechanisms so far only partially understood, such as genomic mutations of the l-kappa B gene and the fas receptor gene or probably by down-regulation of B cell markers. In rare cases, HRS cells of HL can also be derived from T cells, as could be demonstrated by single cell analysis. Also, it could be shown by single cell PCR that HL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of both B and T cell types can arise from a common precursor. These results suggest that future classifications of HL will not only take into account the morphological and phenotypical profile, but also mechanisms of transformation yet to be discovered.","2071":"With the availability of Internet, the interest in the possibilities of telepathology has increased considerably. In the foreground is thereby the need of the non-expert to bring in the opinions of experts on morphological findings by means of a fast and simple procedure. The new telepathology system iPath is in compliance with these needs. The system is based on small, but when possible independently working modules. This concept allows a simple adaptation of the system to the individual environment of the user (e.g. for different cameras, frame-grabbers, microscope steering tables etc.) and for individual needs. iPath has been in use for 6 months with various working groups. In telepathology a distinction is made between \"passive\" and \"active\" consultations but for both forms a non-expert brings in the opinion of an expert. In an active consultation both are in direct connection with each other (orally or via a chat-function), this is however not the case with a passive consultation. An active consultation can include the interactive discussion of the expert with the non-expert on images in an image database or the direct interpretation of images from a microscope by the expert. Four software modules are available for a free and as fast as possible application: (1) the module \"Microscope control\", (2) the module \"Connector\" (insertion of images directly from the microscope without a motorized microscope), (3) the module \"Client-application\" via the web-browser and (4) the module \"Server\" with a database. The server is placed in the internet and not behind a firewall. The server permanently receives information from the periphery and returns the information to the periphery on request. The only thing which the expert, the non-expert and the microscope have to know is how contact can made with the server.","2072":"Immunohistochemical studies on metastatic carcinomas of unknown primary site are cost-effective and often allow a specific identification of the tumour origin, especially if the metastases are adenocarcinomas by light microscopy. Commercially available site-specific markers include prostate-specific antigen, thyroglobulin, thyroid transcription factor-1, uroplakin III, GCDFP-15, oestrogen and progesterone receptors, alpha-fetoprotein, the A103 monoclonal antibody against MART-1, cytokeratins 7 and 20, cytokeratins of basal cell type, p63, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA125, EMA, vimentin, HepPar-1, WT-1 and S100 protein. However, immunostaining with most of these markers does not show an absolute specificity for a certain primary site. For this reason, histopathologists interpretating staining results with these markers should take the available clinical data and the histological features of the metastatic carcinoma into consideration. These data are necessary to estimate the relative a priori probability of possible carcinomas. Based on Bayes' theorem, the a priori probability can then be used to calculate the diagnostically relevant predictive values for immunostaining results with the chosen markers.","2073":"The field of tumor genetics is characterized by a whole string of unsolved questions that affect both the basics of tumorigenesis and the possibilities of using molecular markers at the clinical level. Telomerase, an enzyme that has the capability of unlimitedly maintaining the division of immortal cells, can nowadays be demonstrated with the use of up-to-date molecular biological methods. In vitro experiments have now succeeded in changing normal cells into tumor cells via transfection with telomerase. The regulatory mechanisms and interactions of telomerase are presently the subject of intensive research. Telomerase activity plays a crucial role even in present day diagnostic procedures and the estimation of prognosis for certain tumor types. In comparison with normal tissues, increased telomerase activity in tumor tissues implies therapeutical possibilities with the use of telomerase inhibitors.","2074":"The diagnosis of hematopoietic neoplasias has nowadays become more and more refined by molecular cytogenetic and molecular biological techniques. The biological basis of most of these techniques is that (malignant) tumors represent clonal neoplasias that are derived from a single or few progenitor cells, thus imparting a clonal relationship to all daughter cells. Apart from clonality analysis as a marker for neoplastic growth, the presence or absence of certain primary chromosome abnormalities, and the number and the kind of secondary genetic anomalies become increasingly important in the delineation of the biological grade of aggressiveness.","2075":"There are only a few clinically relevant applications of molecular pathology assays in solid tumors. Among the findings which may influence therapy decisions are the amplification of Her-2\/new in breast cancer and specific translocations in sarcomas. Mutation analyses of p53 may be helpful for only a very few cases, e.g. for confirming high grade dysplasia in the upper gastrointestinal tract or for diagnosing malignant soft tissue tumors in isolated cases. Microsatellite analyses are important for HNPCC screening or distinguishing tissue specimens of questionable identity. Other applications of molecular pathology assays such as detection of minimal residual disease or tumor cell dissemination and FISH analysis of urine and effusion specimens, may be increasingly applied in the future.","2076":"","2077":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) can be found in virtually any location of the human body. Histologically a mesenchymal aspect predominates and makes these mostly benign tumors apt to be erroneously diagnosed as a soft tissue sarcoma. Cases showing infiltrative growth and local recurrence further complicate the assessment. Localization of an IMT in the pancreas is extremely rare. Clinical investigations regularly lead to the putative diagnosis of a malignant tumor and only subsequent histological examination can establish the correct tumor classification. We present the case of a 62-year-old woman with IMT of the pancreas. Evidence of lymph node involvement has not yet been reported in this setting.","2078":"Heterotopic ossification of gastric adenocarcinomas is very rarely observed in humans. In rats such lesions could be induced by ingestion of nitroso compounds. We describe the case of a 70-year-old patient with an extended, initially spleen-infiltrating tubular adenocarcinoma of the stomach with a mucinous component, heterotopic ossifications and pronounced regressive alterations after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Various speculations regarding the pathogenesis of heterotopic ossifications in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas are discussed.","2079":"We report the case of a spiradenocarcinoma (malignant eccrine spiradenoma), a rare variant of a malignant sweat gland tumor, which occurred in the scalp of a 63-year-old woman. Some years before the current tumor occurred, a tumour of unknown histology had been excised from the same localization. The new tumor presented with rapid growth and exulceration. Malignant eccrine spiradenoma is characterized by the coincidence of a benign and a malignant portion within one specimen. We report case example 47 of this entity. The peculiarity of this case is the enormous heterogeneity with foci of atypical histiocytes like an atypical fibroxanthoma and an extensive foreign body reaction with cholesterol needles as in a xanthogranuloma. Static DNA cytophotometric analysis revealed different degrees of aneuploidy in the three tumor portions. The follow-up of 23 months is without recurrent tumor. A review of the literature is given.","2080":"The congenital granular cell tumor is a rare lesion of newborns located on the alveolar ridge with a marked predilection for female infants. Histologically these tumors are characterized by large eosinophilic granular cells, similar to granular cell tumors in adults which are often seen as Abrikossoff tumors. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the different histogenesis and evolution of both these tumor entities. We report on a female newborn infant with a congenital epulis of the left anterior maxillary alveolar ridge. This case demonstrates a rare congenital tumor of newborns and reveals the histogenetic differences to granular cell tumors in adults.","2081":"Skeinoid fibers are interstitial collections of a pathological collagen, most often seen in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. They were first described in 1991. We report two cases of intestinal stromal tumors, one in an exceptionally young patient with excessive skeinoid fiber deposition. The microscopic as well as the ultrastructural findings of skeinoid fibers are demonstrated and their role is discussed considering the newest literature.","2082":"Pseudoactinomycotic radiate granules, also known as the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon represent a response to organic and in-organic foreign substances and can be found at various locations in the body. They are frequently observed in uterine curettages, where they can be misinterpreted as actinomycotic sulfur granules. Here we report a case with Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon in an intrauterine device (IUD)-associated genital actinomycosis. The morphological features of this phenomenon are presented using special staining methods and electron microscopy and the literature is reviewed.","2083":"The concept of the dysplastic nevus is flawed by inconsistencies regarding the clinical presentation, histological features and biological considerations. With regard to basic mechanisms of malignancy, dysplastic nevi exhibit neither increased proliferation indices nor elevated telomerase activity. These traits denote a benign lesion that is highly prevalent among Caucasians. In rare cases, the distinction from malignant melanoma may pose problems.","2084":"Tumours of lymphatic vessels comprise only a small group in the heterogeneous spectrum of vascular neoplasms of skin and soft tissues. However, this discrepancy between haemangiomas\/angiosarcomas and lymphangiomas\/lymphangiosarcomas probably represents the present inability to reliably differentiate between lymphatic and capillary vascular endothelium. Histologically, neoplastic lymphatic vessels tend to be lined by endothelial cells with plumper and more prominent, matchstick-like nuclei (in contrast to vascular spaces in haemangiomas that are lined by flat or epithelioid endothelial cells), often show variations in the thickness of the vessel walls and are not completely surrounded by actin-positive (myo)pericytes. Endothelial cells in lymphatic neoplasms tend to be negative for CD34 or stain only focally positive for this marker and an expression of lymphatic markers as vascular endothelial growth factor-C receptor (VEGRF-3), podoplanin and M2A oncofetal antigen has been reported most recently. In addition to \"traditional\" lymphatic neoplasms including lymphangioma circumscriptum, cavernous lymphangioma\/cystic hygroma, benign lymphangioendothelioma, lymphangiomatosis and the rare lymphangiosarcoma, histological and immunohistochemical features of a group of vascular neoplasms with a hobnail cytomorphology (hobnail haemangioma, retiform haemangioendothelioma, papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma, benign lymphangiomatous papule following radiotherapy) suggest that these lesions also belong to the spectrum of tumours of lymphatic vessels.","2085":"By applying strict diagnostic criteria and a standardized classification (Chapel Hill 1994) an attempt has been made to shed some light on the varying and sometimes puzzling information concerning the quantity and quality of skin lesions with systemic vasculitis or vasculitis associated with certain types of dermatitis. It has to be emphasized that associated skin lesions are hereby non-specific. However, a palpable purpura with a predeliction for the lower extremities is considered to be quite typical. The same diagnostic criteria as for systemic vasculitis should also be applied to dermatitis with associated vasculitis. It also has to be stressed that not all patients with a certain type of dermatitis necessarily show a vasculitis. However, if present, an associated vasculitis does not always involve all blood vessels, therefore it may not show up in each histological section examined. The gold standard of diagnosis of a vasculitis is a biopsy with hematoxylin staining and in additional van Gieson-elastica staining may be helpful. According to actual experience gained since their introduction, immunohistochemical and immunological methods play only a supportive role.","2086":"As in subcutaneous and deep soft tissues, cutaneous mesenchymal neoplasms are also relatively rare and characterized by a clinicopathological heterogeneity. There are striking differences in regard to the occurrence of different lines of differentiation of mesenchymal neoplasms in superficial and deep locations, and some distinct entities arise exclusively in the dermis. Superficially located mesenchymal neoplasms are characterized by a number of specific morphological features in comparison to deeper located lesions. Clinically important, dermal sarcomas of some lines of differentiation are associated with a favorable clinical prognosis, independent of the histological grading, which is important to know for the correct treatment of patients. In the following review similarities and distinguishing clinicopathological features of superficially and deeply located mesenchymal tumors are discussed.","2087":"In the following a short overview on inflammatory dermatoses which are frequently diagnosed in clinical dermatology is presented. These include allergic contact dermatitis, dyshidrotic dermatitis, nummular dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus and psoriasis. Special emphasis is laid on the evolutionary stages in the development of lesions, clinically as well as histologically. The abovementioned dermatoses have a special pathological reaction pattern in common: the epidermis, papillary dermis and superficial capillary-venular plexus react together in these conditions and have therefore been termed the superficial cutaneous reactive unit.","2088":"Melanocytic tumors are one of the major problems in diagnostic dermatopathology as they comprise benign nevi, malignant melanomas and borderline cases. Apart from a proportion of congenital lesions, most benign nevi are acquired tumors that arise during early adulthood and eventually may undergo regressive change. Histologically, they present as so-called common nevi, so-called dysplastic nevi, Spitz's nevi, blue nevi and their variants, and combined nevi. In typical cases, the distinction from a malignant melanoma is not difficult. However, benign simulators of malignancy exist as much as deceptively bland appearing melanomas and in some cases the diagnosis remains dubious despite careful weighting of criteria. Indeed, morphological features may not always suffice to disclose the nature of a melanocytic tumor. Ancillary techniques including immunohistochemistry and measurement of telomerase activity may be of assistance in this respect. One should nevertheless be aware that the biological behavior of certain borderline cases cannot be predicted with certainty.","2089":"Sweat gland carcinomas represent a group of morphological heterogeneous tumors with clear differences regarding clinical course and prognosis. The most relevant and accepted entities are described clinically and histopathologically with special reference to the differentiation from benign adnexal tumors. Carcinomas arising from preexisting benign adnexal tumors such as spiradenocarcinoma, cylindrocarcinoma, malignant mixed tumors of the skin are easily recognized. To establish the diagnosis of microcystic adnexal carcinoma or aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma can be more difficult, because these carcinomas do not show cytological criteria for malignancy and may therefore resemble benign adnexal tumors especially in small specimens.","2090":"Epithelial tumors of the cutaneous adnexae are considered to originate from three different structures, i.e., hair follicles, eccrine\/apocrine sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Although this derivation provides a practical basis for classification, some tumors may exhibit a mixed differentiation and thus should be categorized according to the prevailing phenotype. The overwhelming majority of hair follicle tumors are benign but the main diagnostic differential for malignant tumors is basal cell carcinoma. Despite a broad histological spectrum, benign tumors of sweat glands are readily recognized on the grounds of a well characterized morphology. However, it may be difficult to rule out malignancy as each benign entity has a malignant counterpart. True sebaceous neoplasms are rare when hyperplasia and hamartoma are disregarded and in extraocular locations most of them are benign.","2091":"Keratoacanthomas represent epithelial tumors which are characterized by a keratin-filled crater, rapid growth in the proliferation stage, and the potential for spontaneous regression. Histologically, keratoacanthomas display distinct features which must be differentiated from squamous cell carcinomas in the proliferation stage and fully developed tumors and in the regression stage the differential diagnosis of verruca vulgaris must also be considered.","2092":"The microscopically \"invisible dermatoses\" comprise a heterogeneous plethora of skin disorders which are characterized by a stunning discrepancy between the classical clinical findings and very discrete histological alterations suggesting \"normal skin.\" Methods and strategies for the correct histopathological diagnosis of seemingly normal skin are discussed.","2093":"Particulate matter incorporated into the skin of former miners was compared to ornamental tattoos with regard to composition and cutaneous reaction pattern. The specimens were examined histologically and immunohistochemically followed by scanning electron microscopy and element analysis. In the skin biopsies containing dirt particles, silicon and aluminium were regularly found and the particles were positively birefringent under the light microscope. Even years after the initial foreign particle incorporation strong reactions against quartz-containing substances deposited perivascularly and perifollicularly continued to take place. Reactions ranged from strong macrophage activation to pre-granulomatous changes. Anthracotic pigment was demonstrated in all layers of the dermis depending on the degree of traumatic insult and the colour pigments of the ornamental tattoos showed a variable spectra of elements depending on the type of dye used. Fibrous reactions were only discrete, however, strong macrophage activation and sometimes capillary proliferation as well as non-specific lymphocytic infiltration could still be confirmed even decades after the initial incorporation. In conclusion, the cutaneous incorporation of ornamental tattoo dyes and accidental dirt particles is not an inert process. Even years later, non-specific macrophage activation as well as discrete inflammatory changes in an attempt to degrade the foreign material can still be documented. A clear correlation between subcutaneous incorporated quartz particles and progressive systemic sclerosis was not found in this study.","2094":"Skin biopsies are easy to perform, can be done under direct visual control, allow precise clinico-pathological correlation, and, accordingly, the significance of skin biopsies is very high. This review discusses the basic principles of the interpretation of skin biopsies and alerts to problems that may result from the absence of representative changes of a pathological process in the tissue sections, poor processing of tissue, incorrect assessment of histopathology findings, and shortcomings in the clinico-histopathological correlation.","2095":"Specific diagnoses of infectious skin diseases can be established in dermatopathology by several methods: by algorithms based on pattern analysis, by differential diagnosis of clinicopathologically similar disorders, by attention to pitfalls, by exceptions to the rules and finally, very elegantly by clues. Ten clues to specific diagnoses of infectious skin diseases which are of importance in routine practice are presented. Clue 1: Features of an angiocentric angiodestructive lymphoma in the centre of a wedge-shaped necrotic insect bite reaction are a clue to a bite by a spider. Clue 2: Parakeratosis with spiky imprints on the surface above features of an insect bite reaction are a clue to scabies. Clue 3: A faintly eosinophilic section of a skin specimen with prominent fibrin thrombi and extravasated erythrocytes are a clue to a septic fungal vasculitis. Clue 4: Infectious agents in association with otherwise typical features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are a clue to septic vasculitis. Clue 5: Steel-grey nuclei with marginated nucleoplasm of keratinocytes are a clue to the diagnosis of early infection by herpes virus. Clue 6: Owleye-like cells are a clue to infection by cytomegalovirus. Clue 7: Detection of Entamoeba histolytica in perianal and perineal ulcers are a clue to amebiasis. Clue 8: Round-oval to rectangular spaces within the stratum spinosum of the epidermis are a clue to larva migrans. Clue 9: Macrophages and plasma cells in association with otherwise typical features of pityriasis lichenoides are a clue to secondary syphilis. Clue 10: A lichenoid infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells are a clue to acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.","2096":"The histological diagnosis of inflammatory skin diseases on a day-to-day routine basis poses the difficult task to characterise a dynamic clinical process by histomorphological analysis of one single lesion. Very complex algorithms which are meant to lead to the correct diagnosis are difficult to use. To facilitate the process and reduce the number of algorithms the following method is proposed: 1. Histological examination under low power Definition of lesions altered by scratching 2. Localisation of the significant pathological alterations as follows: Changes in epidermis and dermis Blister formation Changes in dermis\/subcutis without characteristic changes in the epidermis Changes mainly in the subcutis 3. Closer examination using a simple algorithm and planning of further investigations following defined criteria: In the case of changes in epidermis and dermis definition of spongiotic, psoriasiform or lichenoid dermatitis (Abb. 1). In the case of blister formation definition of the blister following the given algorithm (Abb. 1). In the case of changes in dermis\/subcutis without characteristic changes in the epidermis after exclusion of vasculitis and lymphoma definition of the main pattern as lymphocytic, neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphoplasmocytic or granulomatous and following the given algorithm (Abb. 2). In the case of changes mainly in the subcutis after exclusion of vasculitis and lymphoma definition of the main pattern of panniculitis as septal or\/and lobular (Abb. 2). Exclusion of PAS positive microorganisms and checking if the general pattern fits into infectious correlation. Use of clinicopathological correlation.","2097":"","2098":"Except for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) include as main subtypes polycythemia vera (PV), chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). A common finding in CMPDs is a clonal evolution associated with a significantly variable course, which may be complicated by thrombocythemia, (secondary) myelofibrosis, and finally acceleration (unstable phase) that merges into blastic crisis. New therapeutic modalities (chemo- and interferon therapy, bone marrow and stem cell transplantation) which were developed in the last decade and the striking differences in survival amongst the different subtypes warrant not only an unequivocal distinction from reactive and allied disorders, but a clear-cut classification as well. For this reason, a synoptical approach is essential including clinical data and, as a major diagnostic tool, a bone marrow biopsy. This concept finds expression in the new WHO classification, which also includes as rare subtypes chronic neutrophilic leukemia, eosinophilic leukemia, chronic hypereosinophilic syndrome, and finally unclassifiable entities. Histopathology of bone marrow biopsies reveals specific findings, in particular concerning megakaryopoiesis, which are characteristic for the different subtypes. These features facilitate the still controversially discussed differentiation of thrombocythemia that is frequently present, as is the case in initial (prefibrotic) IMF from ET. Moreover, in addition to clinical findings,the associated heterogeneity of bone marrow morphology indicates a stepwise evolution of the disease process and thus exerts a significant impact on survival, i.e., in CML regarding erythropoiesis and myelofibrosis and in IMF extent of myeloid metaplasia.","2099":"Diffuse hemangiomatoses are extremely rare in adults. The etiology and natural history of the disease are not well understood. A case of diffuse hemangiomatosis of the liver and spleen associated with progressive liver failure, thrombocytopenia, and disturbance of blood coagulation (comparable to Kasabach-Merritt syndrome) is presented in a 62-year-old male. We describe the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings and illustrate the morphological aspects of differential diagnosis, distinguishing the disease from other vascular proliferations.","2100":"The simultaneous occurrence of different hepatic tumors is rare. We present for the first time a concomitant manifestation of an angiomyolipoma, a focal nodular hyperplasia, a bile duct adenoma, and a cavernous hemangioma in a 63-year-old female patient. The largest of the tumors, preoperatively suspected to be hepatocellular carcinoma, was an angiomyolipoma with monotypic epithelioid histology and positive immunoreactivity for HMB-45, actin, desmin, and pancytokeratin. The significance of immunohistochemistry for the differential diagnosis of hepatic neoplasms is emphasized. Finally, a review of the literature with special regard to etiology and pathogenesis of neoplastic liver disease is given, leading to the assumption that the association of four different benign intrahepatic tumors is rather more fortuitous than pathogenetically related, despite the putative similar pathogenesis of focal nodular hyperplasia and hemangioma.","2101":"Well-differentiated hepatocellular tumors represent a difficult diagnostic problem in hepatopathology with rising clinical impact. The differential diagnosis mainly includes well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its premalignant precursor lesion, the dysplastic nodule (DN), in addition to multiacinar regenerative nodule as well as hepatocellular adenoma (LCA) and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Optimized diagnosis of these lesions is based on exact histomorphological analysis, a close interdisciplinary cooperation as well as good clinical and anamnestic information. Histopathological differential diagnosis requires the search for specific characteristics and detailed analyses of the subtle cytological differences, the histoarchitecture, and also the surrounding nontumorous liver tissue. Special techniques may be helpful in selected cases but currently are of limited importance.","2102":"The great advances in radiological imaging techniques and their widespread availability have focused attention on hepatic premalignant nodular lesions. The histological differential diagnosis of these nodules can often be difficult, especially in needle biopsy specimens with limited material. Diagnostic considerations differ significantly between livers with and without cirrhosis: In the noncirrhotic liver, the differential diagnosis includes liver cell adenoma, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In cirrhosis, dysplastic nodules (low and high grade), dysplasia (large and small cell) as well as hepatocellular carcinoma may occur. The standardization and the uniform use of the nomenclature of these entities are necessary for a better understanding of the biological nature and etiopathology of these lesions. Only a commonly accepted nomenclature makes a comparison of different therapeutic treatment regimens feasible.","2103":"Alcoholic (ASH) and nonalcoholic (NASH) steatohepatitis show an almost identical morphology. Since the clinical picture is not characteristic, liver biopsy is still the diagnostic gold standard. ASH and NASH are morphologically characterized by a combination of steatosis, hepatocellular injury (ballooning degeneration, apoptosis, necrosis), perivenular and pericellular fibrosis, and inflammation (mostly neutrophils). A definitive differentiation of ASH and NASH is only possible by exclusion of alcohol abuse. Although NASH comprises a syndrome with a multifactorial etiology, adipositas seems to be the most constant associated causal factor. The pathogenesis of both diseases is still unclear. Clinical evidence and experimental studies suggest an important toxic role of reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress). According to our experience, ballooning of hepatocytes is a constant morphologic feature of ASH and NASH and already present in the early stages of disease. Ballooned cells often (but not always) contain Mallory bodies (alcoholic hyalin), which are irregular cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of keratins and nonkeratin components, including ubiquitin. Ballooning is associated with a disturbance and finally almost disappearance of the keratin-intermediate filament cytoskeleton. In our studies on the pathogenesis of ASH and NASH, we concentrated on these cytoskeletal alterations and Mallory body formation. It could be shown that in the early stages overexpression and hyperphosphorylation of keratins take place. Moreover, the 1:1 ratio of keratin type I (keratin 18) and type II (keratin 8) necessary for the assembly of intermediate filaments is disturbed and the equilibrium shifted toward keratin 8. Thus, the pool of soluble keratin 8 increases. The resulting keratin monomers are sensitive to misfolding and either degraded or aggregated as inclusion bodies. If the proteolytic capacity is impaired (e.g., by inhibition of the proteasomal system) in the chronically stressed cell aggregation prevails,finally leading to Mallory body formation. Convincing evidence exists on the basis of clinical and experimental studies that keratins exert a nonskeletal protective function in simple epithelia (e.g., liver cells). Disturbance of the keratin system may thus significantly contribute to cell damage.","2104":"The term chronic cholangitis comprises a heterogeneous group of intra- and\/or extrahepatic diseases that may either be bacterially caused or immunologically mediated. In this review, we will focus on the latter and present the clinicopathological and pathogenetic aspects of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The histopathological criteria are defined and differential diagnosis is discussed. Particular emphasis is given to overlap syndromes of PBC and PSC with autoimmune hepatitis. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is presented.","2105":"The evaluation of a liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis should make a statement on the etiology and report the degree of activity and stage of the disease. The category of so called seronegative chronic hepatitis may include cases of chronic hepatitis C or infection with other viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), cases of marker-negative autoimmune hepatitis as well as drug-induced injury and Wilson's disease in younger patients. In order to establish the diagnosis, sensitive techniques of molecular biology should be applied as well as copper staining by histochemistry. Exact and detailed histopathologic analysis can reveal certain features of autoimmune hepatitis or drug injury.","2106":"Histological evaluation of liver biopsies is the gold standard for assessing the severity of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C. In conjunction with anamnestic and serological data, it provides critical information regarding prognosis and therapeutic consequences. Grading of the necroinflammatory activity and staging of the manifested fibrosis according to well-established scoring systems are the essential parameters of the histopathological report. The frequency of chronic hepatitis C necessitates awareness of coinciding liver damage by nutritional or drug toxicity, bile duct diseases, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA directly from the formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen is highly sensitive and offers help in cases of equivocal results of serological testing for HCV.","2107":"","2108":"An aorto-pulmonary window (aorto-pulmonary septal defect) is considered to be a rare congenital cardiac malformation. We report the case of a patient with an unrepaired congenital aorto-pulmonary window 1.4 cm in size which is the largest aorto-pulmonary septal defect yet reported. This patient died at the age of 58 not from the congenital cardiac malformation but from the after-effects of a pulmonary adenocarcinoma diagnosed 2 years previously. Interestingly, the long standing, persistent pulmonary hypertension correlated well with the varying pathomorphological changes seen in the pulmonary vessels. In addition to the complex morphological signs due to the pulmonary hypertension such as the extensive aneurysms found in the left and right main pulmonary arteries (first report of this size), pulmonary vessels with relatively few pathomorphological changes were also found. Hence this first report of such a long survival of a patient with a comparatively large aorto-pulmonary septal defect demonstrates a surprising variety of pathomorphological alterations seen in the pulmonary arteries in the face of excessive pulmonary hypertension. These alterations could be the result of peripheral aneurysmatic formations and thrombembolic stenoses of the lobular or segmental arteries and might provide an explanation for the long survival of this particular congenital cardiac malformation. All these varying findings in the pulmonary arteries emphasise the fact that the pathomorphological findings in lung biopsies might not be representative of the whole lung.","2109":"Primary hemangiosarcoma of the kidney is a very rare tumor for which only 23 case reports appear in the literature worldwide. An additional case of renal angiosarcoma in an adult is reported. The patient developed local tumor recurrence with multiple metastases within 4 weeks and died although there was no evidence of metastases at the time of nephrectomy.","2110":"Three cases of acute segmental hemorrhagic antibiotic-associated colitis are described occurring in three male adults between 30 and 33 years of age after treatment with oral ampicillin or amoxicillin because of upper respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, or HLO eradication therapy, respectively. All presented with cramping abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea of acute onset, however, microbial analysis of fecal samples was negative. Endoscopy showed right-sided segmental hemorrhagic colitis. Histopathological examination demonstrated edema, patchy superficial hemorrhage and a scattered predominantly mononuclear infiltrate of the lamina propria. The surface epithelium was partly desquamated and displayed foci of grouped intraepithelial red blood cells. All patients spontaneously recovered after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The value and limitations of diagnostic features are discussed with respect of the literature.","2111":"Inflammatory fibroid polyps of the gastrointestinal tract represent a relatively rare entity. Although the histopathological classification, the etiology and the pathogenesis of this lesion remains unclear, the biological dignity is commonly understood as benign. Nevertheless, these polyps are able to cause gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction or intussusception which often provides the indication for surgical treatment. In endoscopical biopsies unexpected difficulties for the pathologist may arise from the fact that these uncommon lesions often show a submucosal growth pattern. With reference to two case reports, the clinical, diagnostic and histopathological aspects of inflammatory fibroid polyps will be discussed. An additional literature review of the etiology, immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis is presented.","2112":"Evaluation of prognosis-associated parameters in patients with small cell lung carcinoma. Biopsies of 46 patients suffering from a non-treated small cell lung carcinoma were stained with Feulgen and immunohistochemically with Ki-67 antibody. The integrated optical density (IOD) and proliferation rate was measured by syntactic structure analysis and correlated with survival. About 85% of patients had a smoking history (46 pack years on average). The median survival time was 13.5 months, the proliferation rate (Ki-67 positive tumor cell nuclei) 68.2% and S-phase percentage 9.2%. Ot average, 25 proliferating tumor cell nuclei formed clusters (mean diameter 95 microns). The prognosis was associated with the proliferation rate (p &lt; 0.04), tumor stage (stage I versus lib, p &lt; 0.05), at threshold limits with S-phase rate (p &lt; 0.07) and serum levels of LDH and NSE (p &lt; 0.06 and p &lt; 0.07 respectively). Immune histochemical determination of the Ki-67 protein is a useful method to estimate the prognosis of patients with small cell lung carcinoma. ","2113":"Testicular germ cell tumors are rare and comprise about 90% of all testis tumors. Genetic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis as can be deduced by a higher family-linked incidence and the p53 gene seems to be important in the development of these tumors which derive from a malignant transformed germ cell. Testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) may differentiate in two directions, namely into seminomas which comprise nearly 50% of all testicular germ cell tumors and non-seminomas. Since the term \"differentiated teratoma\" may be misleading, we propose the use of the term \"teratoma\" only. A preoperative diagnosis by biopsy is not indicated. An exact postoperative diagnosis including all necessary classifications, particularly the WHO and the TNM classifications, requires a very careful preparation of the resected specimen. The histological diagnosis should list all the different types of the WHO classification and the percentage of the tumor should be indicated, at least for embryonal carcinomas. For T categorisation in the TNM classification, the presence of invasion of veins or lymph vessels is important. Documentation, preferably in the form of a standard checklist, is strongly recommended.","2114":"Recent technological advances in genome and proteome research offer new perspectives for diagnosis and therapy. The DNA chip technology as well as high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry is able to provide comprehensive information on gene and protein expression patterns, which allow insights into the dynamic and functional aspects of diseases. The application of these techniques depends on the availability of unfixed fresh or cryopreserved tissue with short ischaemia time. For this reason tissue banks are of increasing importance. The pathologist with his expertise and responsibility for histopathological diagnosis, plays a central role in the collection of the human tissues, in accordance with medical, legal and ethical standards, not only for diagnostic purposes, but also for research. The scientific value of a tissue bank is markedly increased if tissue samples are accompanied by detailed patient data as well as blood samples. Informed consent given by the patient is an essential requirement for the use of human tissue banks in biomedical research. The informed consent should not be restricted to scientific investigations but also include the potential commercial use of the data generated.","2115":"Basic principles of classification of tumors of the pituitary, parathyroid glands, adrenals, paraganglionic system and endocrine pancreas and the differential diagnosis from non-endocrine tumors are presented. There are no uniform criteria of malignancy and common neuroendocrine immunohistological markers for unequivocal identification, as each organ has its own criteria. For pituitary tumors invasive growth is not a sign of malignancy, but only metastases. For tumors of the adrenal cortex a histopathological score has to be used for proving dignity. For pheochromocytomas, structural criteria (mitoses, angioinvasion) and immunostaining (S-100 protein, p53, Ki-67) are important. Endocrine tumors of the pancreas behave differently if they are angioinvasive or if they show more than two mitoses per 10 HPF, more than 2% Ki-67 positive nuclei or a size of more than 2 cm in diameter. They are malignant if gross local invasion or metastases are demonstrable. Clinical data have to be included in pathohistological reports. In many cases immunostaining in addition to structural analysis will be necessary.","2116":"","2117":"","2118":"","2119":"","2120":"Every pathologist in active practice must be aware of and follow, set standards and recommendations for the diagnosis of breast carcinoma in order to ensure that the patient has the preconditions for an adequate therapy, regardless of the particular hospital setting. According to present-day knowledge, the standard obligatory examinations include conventional morphology (staging, typing and grading of the tumour) and the analysis of the steroid hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone). The immunohistochemical determination of tumour growth fraction with the Ki-67 antibody is economically justifiable, since it serves as an adjunct for histological\/cytological tumour grading, a method that has a poor level of reproducibility. Since the introduction of herceptin immunotherapy, the determination HER-2\/neu overexpression has gained a practical role and should now be included as an obligatory component of the diagnostic testing. Additional tumour markers are not components of routine diagnosis and these should be limited to clinical studies as long as their prognostic and therapeutic value have not been proven.","2121":"We present a case of pigmented adrenal paraganglioma in a 39-year-old female patient with associated neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Histology showed features typical for phaeochromocytomas except for varying amounts of brown pigment within the cytoplasm of tumour cells, which proved to be melanin by histochemical and ultrastructural analysis. The occurrence of melanin is believed to reflect the origin of this neoplasm from multipotent cells of the neural crest. Pigmented phaeochromocytoma has to be taken in consideration in the differential diagnosis of pigmented neoplasms, especially in the adrenal gland, where it has to be discriminated from pigmented cortical adenoma (so-called black adenoma) and primary malignant melanoma.","2122":"Histoplasmosis is an illness which occurs very rarely in Europe and it is especially rare in Germany. A generalised infection with Histoplasma capulatum, a systemic mycosis of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), occurs only in individuals with weakened immune systems. Within the framework of diagnostics, a pathologist can be confronted with histoplasmosis since there has been an increase in travel to and from endemic regions, as well as an increase in the number of diseases of the immune system. The presented case reports the histological intravital and post-mortem diagnostics of disseminated histoplasmosis in existing HIV-infection in the stage of manifest AIDS.","2123":"We report the pathological anatomy of a patient aged 77 years at the time of death, who suffered from an arachnoid cyst situated near the right lower olive nucleus. This led to palsy of the hypoglossal nerve and partial gliosis of the brainstem with consecutive hemiatrophy of the tongue. This lesion did not seem to have any further effects onto clinical presentation. The patient died of a fulminant lung embolism and also presented an adenocarcinoma of the lung.","2124":"C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) occurs regularly in the setting of type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2), either separately or in association with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). It can also accompany sporadic MTC and appear without any tumour association. To test the practicability of the terms \"physiologic\" and \"neoplastic\", 18 cases with incidental sporadic, non-MTC associated CCH were investigated and the morphological patterns were described. We found CCH of various degrees, including so-called neoplastic CCH. In 16 of the 18 cases, a MEN2 setting could be ruled out by mutation analysis of the RET proto-oncogene. Morphologically, one can not distinguish with certainty between sporadic and hereditary or reactive and tumour-associated CCH. While MEN2-associated CCH can be regarded as true preneoplasia, sporadic CCH possesses variable biologic potential. The preneoplastic potential of sporadic CCH is still obscure. A pure morphological distinction between \"physiologic\" and \"neoplastic\" CCH regardless of the RET status should not be used.","2125":"The morphological findings in organ systems following exhumation, form the basis for answering a number of medical insurance issues. The aim of this study was to analyse the development of the number of exhumations performed and the medical insurance relevance over a 31-year-period. A total of 371 exhumations, performed between 1967-1998 at the Institute of Pathology, Occupational Associations Hospital, Bochum, for medical insurance reasons were evaluated. The average number of days after burial was 74, ranging from 9 to 47.8. For the first third of the period investigated, the proportion of exhumations was 3.5% of all autopsy cases, for the second third this fell to about 0.4% and rose to 1.5% for the last third. In the first two-thirds, the main reasons for the exhumations were related to the grading and effects of pneumoconioses in connection with the cause of death. In the last third, asbestos-associated diseases were mainly involved. In 99.2% of all cases, the autopsy results revealed important evidence for clarification of the medical insurance issues. The current catalogue of expectations listing the pathomorphological findings which can be expected after certain periods of internment, could be extended by our own results.

The condition typically occurs in infants and adolescents; however, as an incomplete form, desmosis coli can also cause chronic constipation in adults, as demonstrated in this case report.","2130":"Galectin-3 belongs to a group of endogenous lectins with an affinity to glycoconjugates containing beta-galactoside residues. It has been detected in numerous tissues and studied in connection with tumor growth, dedifferentiation, and metastasis. Only few studies have dealt with galectin-3 detection in tumors of the thyroid gland and with its possible role for differential diagnosis. We studied 118 cases of thyroid gland tumors with a monoclonal antibody against galectin-3; we compared the preparations by a semiquantitative score to determine differences in expression. Normal thyroid gland tissue, goiter tissue, and tissue with functional enhancement were largely negative for galectin-3. Adenomas with a typical cytological pattern were predominantly negative, but a focal positive reaction in single cells and cell groups or follicles was possible. Almost all papillary carcinomas showed a distinct galectin-3 expression. While findings in follicular carcinomas and oxyphilic adenomas and carcinomas were very uneven, with both positive and negative tumors, the galectin-3 reaction can be helpful in recognizing follicular variants of the papillary carcinoma. Investigation of the biological significance of tumors should always be cautious and consider known histological criteria for malignancy.","2131":"Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting only women which is characterised by cystic parenchymal changes and smooth muscle proliferation and has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease. The LAM cell is classified as a so-called perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) showing immunohistochemical co-expression of smooth muscle and melanocytic markers (melanomyopericyte). A total of 18 cases of LAM and 56 cases of various other pulmonary diseases were analysed by immunohistochemistry. For the diagnosis of LAM in transbronchial or open lung biopsies, immunohistochemistry using the antibody HMB 45 is decisive because it shows a highly specific and sensitive, but often only faint reaction for pulmonary LAM. The immunohistochemical detection of nuclear localised microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF) in LAM as an additional melanocytic marker further emphasises the melanocytic (as well as smooth muscle) line of differentiation within the cells of LAM. Using the concept of a melanomyopericyte, pulmonary LAM could be classified as a hamartomatous interstitial lung disease showing perivascular smooth muscle and partial melanocytic differentiation.","2132":"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disease in which increased iron absorption causes iron overload and irreversible tissue damage. As laboratory parameters for measuring HH lack specificity, and HH remains asymptomatic for a long time, methods for genetic screening are highly valuable. Mutations in two genes, hfe and TfR2, have recently been found to be responsible for HH. The mutation C282Y in the hfe gene is detected in 70-95% of German and Austrian HH patients. Mutations in the TfR2 gene have been detected only very recently, and results of larger epidemiological studies are not yet available. Molecular methods permit molecular diagnosis and genetic screening.","2133":"Although modern imaging can predict the diagnosis of the vast majority of liver neoplasms, liver biopsy remains the safest, most accurate and most economical diagnostic gold standard for therapeutic implications. Refined preparation techniques using fine-needle biopsy lead to the correct diagnosis by conventional staining in most cases. Metastases and rare mesenchymal liver tumors that mimic primary hepatocellular tumors morphologically can be distinguished by use of a panel of antibodies in immunohistochemistry. Precursors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain difficult to categorize in small biopsy specimens. Differentiation of HCC from regenerative nodules and liver cell adenomas can be achieved by molecular techniques applicable to formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue (FISH or ISH). The grading and staging of resected malignant liver neoplasms according the pTNM system still have the most important prognostic impact, but screening of changes in the cell cycle by immunohistochemistry and application of molecular techniques may prove to have prognostic value in the near future.","2134":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) occurs principally but not exclusively in younger age groups. It can present as a single lesion or as multiple lesions and can affect one or several organ systems. Diagnosis of LCH requires the identification of CD1a and S-100 positive histiocytes. The range of synonyms used for LCH reflects both the variable clinical presentation and the variations in the histological \"development stage\" of the individual lesions from one case to another. The term LCH has now been accepted for all manifestations of the disease. The extent of the disease in a given case is specified by determining the number and location of foci and by ascertaining whether one or several organ systems are affected, and whether organ dysfunction exists. Among cases of LCH in adults, pulmonary LCH has a special status, as this usually results from cigarette smoking and is generally limited to the lungs. The lungs may also be affected in \"conventional\" LCH, and organ dysfunction may also exist in this form of the disease. In general, the morphology of LCH is sufficiently characteristic that the differential diagnosis versus other types of histiocytosis should not be difficult, provided an adequate specimen is available for examination.","2135":"","2136":"Gastric carcinomas are classified histogenetically into diffuse and differentiated types. The latter are often referred to as intestinal-type carcinomas and are believed to originate from intestinal metaplasia. However, histogenetic studies on smaller and initial lesions of the differentiated adenocarcinoma do not support this. From phenotypical expressions of neoplastic lesions arising in hyperplastic polyps of the stomach we first proposed an entity of gastric-type adenocarcinomas, which has been widely accepted. Our recent mucin and immunohistochemical investigations reveal that most smaller adenocarcinomas retain gastric-type differentiation and that those of the exclusively intestinal phenotype are rather rare. On the other hand, most adenomas are strongly and extensively positive for intestinal marker, indicating that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is not a common event in the stomach carcinogenesis. Other studies show that the expression of intestinal mucin or carbohydrate antigen as expressed in intestinal metaplasia is manifested more extensively in carcinoma cells in larger tumors. It is suggested that intestinalization of tumor cells is a time-dependent phenomenon. Differential gene abnormalities between gastric- and intestinal-type carcinomas of the stomach are discussed, regarding their histogenesis and progression.","2137":"Most patients with Crohn's disease undergo upper endoscopy with biopsy at least once, and for the pathologist it is of utmost importance to classify the lesions observed in biopsy specimens from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Duodenal and gastric specimens present two patterns of inflammation: a focal inflammation, with the inflammatory process restricted to a few glands, and a discontinuous inflammation, with the inflammation involving the entire or at least large parts of the specimens. In the latter, the mucosal architecture is compromised. The occurrence of epitheloid granulomas may support the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, but is not mandatory. Crohn's disease can be recognized in specimens taken from the esophagus only if granulomas or giant cells are found beneath the epithelial layer. This review discusses the most important differential diagnoses of inflammatory lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract.","2138":"Acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcomas are low-grade sarcomas of the distal extremities, first described by Meis-Kindblom and Kindblom in 1998. In our series of six cases this sarcoma occurred in four men and two women aged 22-60 years (mean 42.8). The tumors measured 1-4 cm (mean 2.4) and were localized in the foot (two cases), finger (two), wrist (one), and upper arm (one). The patients had a short history of a painless mass (mean duration 3 months). The tumors were poorly circumscribed, and infiltrated the subcutaneous fat and in one case each also the dermis and musculature. Histological features of the tumors were a multinodular configuration with infiltrative margins, myxoid and fibrotic zones with hyalinized areas, moderately pleomorphic cells with large cells showing a prominent nucleolus and an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Two months after excision the tumor recurred locally in two cases; no metastases were observed. Differential diagnosis is especially necessary from inflammatory pseudotumors and more aggressive sarcomas.","2139":"Primary pulmonary mesenchymal tumors are rare causes of intrathoracic lesions in newborns. We describe a case of pulmonary spindle-cell tumor with features of infantile fibrosarcoma and discuss the differential diagnosis of spindle-cell lesions in this location. In view of further case reports of the literature, this neoplasia can best be categorized in a spectrum of fibroblastic\/myofibroblastic differentiated spindle-cell tumors, with excellent prognosis. Especially in congenital lesions a favorable clinical course is to be expected after complete surgical resection. Additional radio- and\/or chemotherapy is not recommended.","2140":"Xanthomatous changes are unusual lesions of the corpus endometrium that may mask endometrial carcinoma. The term \"xanthomatous endometritis\" refers to morphological changes frequently induced by estrogen stimulation. We report for the first time a case of uterine metastasis of balloon-cell melanoma mimicking xanthomatous endometritis. Light microscopic, immunohistological, and ultrastructural results are presented and discussed in connection with our ideas on the pathogenesis of this peculiar tumor. The findings favor the hypothesis of a regressive phenomenon in the balloon-cell transformation of melanoma cells. The melan-A immunohistology seems to be more important in the diagnosis of balloon cell melanoma than the classic melanoma antibody HMB 45.","2141":"Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of young adults. Cardiac involvement is rarely diagnosed clinically. It presents with arrhythmias, conduction disorders, increasing myocardial insufficiency, or sudden death. We report a 42-year-old man with cardiac conduction disturbances of unknown cause who died of sudden cardiac death. Sarcoidosis with prominent cardiac involvement was diagnosed only at autopsy. Cardiac sarcoidosis should be considered in young patients with unexplained conduction disorders.","2142":"Mastocytosis is characterized by abnormal proliferation of mast cells especially within the skin and bone marrow and is often associated with osteoporosis. Mast cells can synthesize a variety of cytokines that are known to affect the skeletal system, but the cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to osteoporosis in systemic mastocytosis remain poorly understood. To further characterize mastocytosis-associated osteoporosis we compared bone histomorphometric findings in iliac crest biopsy specimens from 158 untreated patients with mastocytosis. The overall prevalence of mastocytosis in the specimens diagnosed with osteoporosis was 1.25%, but that in patients younger than 45 years was 2.25%. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1, in contrast to 1:2 in osteoporosis. Osteopenia was present in 64% of the patients with mastocytosis, while osteosclerosis was rare (3%). Histological criteria are the concentric increase in mast cells in the perivascular tissue and the increase in elongated mast cells within the marrow space. Histomorphometry showed mastocytosis to be associated with moderate hyperosteoidosis and increased perforating bone resorption, indicated by a significant decrease in bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number as compared to controls. Osteoclast number was not altered, pointing to a functional effect of mast cells and\/or its product on osteoclasts, rather than an effect on osteoclast differentiation. We conclude that although the prevalence of mastocytosis seems to be low, its correct and early diagnosis is crucial for at least 2.25% of younger patients with osteoporosis.","2143":"Clinicians disagree over the need to perform liver biopsy in chronic infections with hepatitis B and C viruses, with opinions ranging from \"useless\" to \"conditionally advisable\" to \"absolutely necessary.\" The frequency of liver biopsies has generally been declining, which entails decreased practical knowledge in the morphological examination of liver biopsies. As a result certain basic considerations must occasionally reemphasized.","2144":"Adenocarcinomas of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are rare tumors that begin with malignant transformation of the bile duct epithelia. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas derive from the small bile ducts located proximally to the right and left hepatic ducts. Extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas originate in the right or left hepatic duct, the cystic duct, or the choledochal duct. Tumors located at the bifurcation are called Klatskin tumors. The intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are classified according to the TNM classification of liver tumors, while the extrahepatic bile duct tumors have their own TNM classification. Several factors, accompanied by a chronic inflammatory reaction, have been discussed in the etiopathogenesis of these tumors: schistosomiasis, ulcerative colitis with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and inborn bile duct cysts of the liver as a consequence of a disturbance of the ductal plate formation. Over 95% of bile duct tumors are adenocarcinomas. In the nomenclature of precursor lesions a two-grade classification of dysplasia (low-grade versus high-grade) has been found to be more reproducible.","2145":"Gastroenteropancreatic endocrine or neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) encompass a broad spectrum of neoplasms characterized by a heterogeneous biological behavior. They differ with regard to functional state, localization, and derivation from various segments of the primitive embryonal gut, growth pattern, degree of differentiation, expression of different neuroendocrine marker molecules, and prognosis. They occur generally as sporadic tumors but sometimes also in the setting of a familial cancer syndrome such as in type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The complex manifestations of NETs are reflected by the varying terms and classification systems. However, the terms \"carcinoid\" and islet cell tumor\" do not indicate whether the tumors are benign, malignant, or of uncertain behavior. New clinical, morphological, and molecular developments in the field of neuroendocrine biology are contributing to the identification and characterization of NETs and are considered in the current World Health Organization classification.","2146":"Since the microbiological discovery of Tropheryma whippelii, Whipple's disease has attracted to new attention in clinical medicine. As small intestinal biopsy is the diagnostic procedure, the impact of knowledge about the histopathological features of Whipple's disease and its differential diagnosis has increased. PAS-positive macrophages in the intestinal mucosa are the diagnostic hallmark, but further subtyping of cells is important. In Whipple's disease macrophages with intensely PAS-positive granular particles in the cytoplasm (type 1) should be distinguished from cells with faintly PAS-positive cytoplasm without granular particles (type 3). The latter type of macrophages may persist even for many years but does not affect a diagnosis of intestinal remission. However, as systemic infection with T. whippelii is common, but intestinal biopsy specimens are not representative for other organs, additional investigations are performed. These include analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid by means of cytology and polymerase chain reaction, even in patients without neurological symptoms. For ascertaining eradication of T. whippelii in the cerebrospinal fluid, polymerase chain reaction is more reliable than cytology.","2147":"The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is based upon histological findings in duodenal or jejunal biopsy specimens. In recent years it has been seen that the development of CD lesion in the small bowel is a dynamic process which may present in various histological forms. At one end of the spectrum is a mucosa with normal architecture and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes; at the other end is the classical flat mucosa. Histological features supporting the diagnosis of CD are architectural changes of the villi and\/or crypts, an increase in lamina propria cell density, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes counts. Exact histological classification of the histological findings is required for diagnostic purposes and for monitoring of CD patients. This has become possible by using a modified Marsh classification. We present both the histological presentation of CD and the modified Marsh classification, and the most important differential diagnoses.","2148":"The most important differential diagnosis of specialized intestinal columnar cell metaplasia (Barrett's-mucosa) is the intestinal metaplasia of the cardia mucosa (possibly caused by Helicobacter infection). Furthermore it happens from time to time that Barrett's regenerative epithelium is overdiagnosed as low-grade dysplasia (unequivocal intraepithelial neoplasia). This might explain the disappearance of many low-grade dysplasias during further follow-up. Mucosal adenocarcinomas are often underdiagnosed as dysplastic lesions. Therefore many authors tried to establish molecular methods for improvement of the diagnostic possibilities. Immunohistochemistry or PCR with p53 and HER 2-neu might give at least some help but a negative reaction does not exclude a neoplasia in every case. The gold standard is careful endoscopy and biopsy taking with good documentation of the endoscopical findings and most important still the routine H&amp;E stain are the only reliable diagnostic tools.","2149":"Lymphocytic gastritis, first described by Haot et al. in 1986, is a very rare form of gastritis (0.8-1.6% of cases) with unclear pathogenesis. On endoscopy, lymphocytic gastritis may present either a normal appearance, such as gastritis varioliformis with multiple elevated chronic erosions in the corpus and fundus, or as a giant fold gastritis in the corpus and fundus. This type of gastritis is diagnosed histologically based on an accumulation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (more than 25\/100 epithelial cells) in the surface cells of the gastric mucosa. Its etiopathogenesis is currently thought to be a sprue-associated reaction or an atypical reaction to Helicobacter pylori infection. Some studies report the lymphocytic gastritis in almost 45% of cases of sprue, with the gastritis regressing in response to a gluten-free diet, while others report a correlation of lymphocytic gastritis with serologically and\/or histologically confirmed H. pylori infection, with the lymphocytic gastritis being cured by H. pylori eradication treatment in a high percentage of the cases. It is possible that a similar abnormal immune reaction to an inflammatory agent underlies both pathological entities, sprue and lymphocytic gastritis--in the one case gluten and in the other H. pylori--which would mean that sprue-induced and H. pylori-induced forms of lymphocytic gastritis exist side by side.","2150":"Chemical or reactive gastritis is commonly induced by endogenous substances such as bile and pancreas secretions, but can it also be caused by exogenous noxious substances, including acetylsalicylic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chemotherapeutics, and alcohol. The histopathological patterns are similar, involving epithelial damage extending up to erosions with consecutive regenerative hyperplasia and damage to capillaries, with edema, hemorrhage, and proliferation of smooth muscles. As cellular infiltrates are minimal or lacking, some authors have proposed the term \"gastropathy\" instead of the term chemical or reactive gastritis as proposed by the updated Sydney classification. This contribution describes the different patterns and grades and discusses their pathogenesis. Mixed forms of chemical\/reactive gastritis and other forms of gastritis are also described, for example, that from Helicobacter.","2151":"A number of seminars have shown considerable differences between Japanese and Western pathologists in the the diagnostic differentiation of regenerative changes, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma in gastroenterological biopsy material. Lesions which most Western pathologists identify as \"dysplasia\" are often considered adenocarcinomas in Japan. A comparison of the biopsy-based diagnoses with those established in resected mucosa, however, reveals appreciable diagnostic inexperience on the part of Western pathologists, with significant discrepancies between their diagnoses based on biopsies and those based on resected material. Against this background, a new classification of epithelial neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract was drafted on the occasion of the World Congress of Gastroenterology in Vienna in 1998. By collapsing the diagnoses \"high-grade adenoma\/dysplasia, noninvasive carcinoma (carcinoma in situ), and suspected invasive carcinoma\" into a single category (\"noninvasive high-grade neoplasia,\" category 4), this scheme should largely eliminate the diagnostic discrepancies between Western and Japanese pathologists. As with every classification, the Vienna classification has its advantages and disadvantages; these are discussed here. The most important advantage of the Vienna classification is that the various categories are associated with different recommendations for further diagnostic and therapeutic measures. This applies particularly to category 4, with the recommendation for only local treatment initially (endoscopic mucosal resection or surgical excision). Since the introduction of the Vienna classification the new WHO classification of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract has recently been published, in which the term dysplasia has been replaced by \"intraepithelial neoplasia.\" This means that the Vienna classification needs to be modified accordingly.","2152":"Gastric carcinoma is one of the commonly diagnosed malignancies and remains an important cause of mortality in the Western hemisphere. Various sequences of genetic alterations may be responsible for the development of gastric cancer, as there exist two histological types: well-differentiated or intestinal-type and poorly differentiated or diffuse-type gastric cancers. While new genetic findings open new perspectives on carcinogenesis and molecular biology of gastric cancer, they have not been widely applied in routine diagnostic procedures, classification systems, disease monitoring, or prognostic assessment. We discuss the mechanisms molecular pathology in relation to their potential clinical relevance.","2153":"Primarily on the basis of epidemiological evidence, Helicobacter pylori was classified as a definite human carcinogen in 1994. Although several pathophysiological consequences of chronic H. pylori gastritis have been identified which may contribute to the development of gastric carcinoma, it is still largely unknown why only a minority of individuals infected with H. pylori (approximately 1\/1000) develop this fatal disease. In recent years many studies have examined potential risk factors of H. pylori gastritis to improve our understanding of the early events in gastric carcinogenesis. The present paper summarizes research data supporting the following hypotheses: (a) Some H. pylori possess virulence factors which may contribute to the pathogenicity of the organism and may increase the risk for subsequent severe gastroduodenal diseases such as gastric cancer. However, the associations between these virulence factors and disease is not specific, and may vary considerably among different geographic regions. (b) Chronic H. pylori gastritis induces several pathophysiological alterations which may promote cancer development. In particular, the corpus-dominant phenotype of H. pylori gastritis is strongly associated with gastric cancer. (c) A family history of gastric cancer per se, but also in combination with H. pylori infection, is associated with histopathological and molecular alterations that are considered relevant in gastric carcinogenesis.","2154":"Recent studies report a significant association between Helicobacter pylori gastritis and autoimmune reaction. Antigastric autoantibodies are detectable in about 30% of H. pylori infected patients. Two major in situ binding sites have been found: first, at the luminal membrane of the foveolar epithelium in antrum and corpus mucosa and, second, at canalicular membranes within parietal cells in the corpus mucosa. The presence of latter type of autoantibodies is correlated with histological and clinical parameters of corpus mucosa atrophy. The gastric H+\/K(+)-ATPase, which is already known as an autoantigen in classic autoimmune gastritis, also represents a major target in atrophic H. pylori gastritis. According to recent data molecular mimicry between H. pylori and the host does not play a pathogenic role in the formation these autoantibodies. In conclusion, antigastric autoimmunity represents a relevant host factor which contributes to the final outcome of H. pylori gastritis.","2155":"Helicobacter pylori infection sometimes leads to an antigastric autoimmunity that ultimately develops into complete atrophy of the glands of the gastric mucosal glands. It has been found that the \"classical\" parietal cell antibody positive and H. pylori induced autoimmune gastritis share common aspects of histomorphology, stages, and pathomechanisms. Healing of H. pylori associated active preatrophic autoimmune gastritis by eradication treatment has been confirmed both in case reports and in prospective and retrospective studies. This leads to a general practice-oriented four-step concept for diagnosis and treatment in daily routine: (a) Histological work-up on the basis of: lymphocytic infiltration of the glands of the corpus and fundic mucosa, focal destruction in individual corpus glands, reactive hypertrophy of the parietal cells, and search for H. pylori. (b) Additional serological work-up if histological evidence of H. pylori is lacking: determination of H. pylori and parietal cell antibodies in the serum. (c) Initiation of an established H. pylori eradication therapy if histology and\/or serology is positive for H. pylori. (d) Histological and serological follow-up for 9-12 months to monitor the results of treatment.","2156":"Helicobacter pylori gastritis, a very common condition, may lead to serious sequelae such as peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Histological grading of the various gastritis parameters can help to identify the risk of these sequelae and thus improve the indication for prophylactic treatment of the H. pylori infection. This applies in particular to two types of \"risk gastritis\": gastritis of the duodenal ulcer phenotype and gastritis of the carcinoma phenotype. In the former the antrum shows pronounced inflammatory changes while only low-grade gastritis is seen in the corpus. In the latter, by contrast, the gastritis in the corpus is at least equally as severe as that in the antrum; in addition, intestinal metaplasia and focal atrophy is also frequently found in this phenotype. By establishing topographic grading of the gastritis in antrum and corpus the pathologist can therefore play the role of a \"litmus test\" for prophylactic H. pylori eradication treatment.","2157":"","2158":"A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea. Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus. Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology. The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day. At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration. Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected. The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.","2159":"Undifferentiated small-cell hepatoblastoma (HB) is a rare malignant tumor of childhood. The cell of origin is supposed to be a pluripotential, probably entodermal, stem-cell. Differential diagnosis of this type of HB is difficult among the group of small round and blue cell malignant tumors of children. The immunohistochemically determined coexpression of cytokeratin 8, 18, and 19 and of vimentin and actin, regularly in the absence of alpha-fetoprotein expression may be diagnostically helpful. We present the case of an undifferentiated small-cell HB of a 15-month-old girl with agenesis of the right kidney. As morphological peculiarity the tumor presented disseminated histiocytic giant cells.","2160":"Clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a rare, low-malignant bone tumor. The lesion most commonly occurs in adults, generally in the 3rd or 4th decade. Clear-cell chondrosarcoma has a predilection for the epiphyses of long tubular bones, particularly the femoral head. Radiologically, it is a sharply defined radiolucent lesion. Histologically, it is characterized by large tumor cells with distinct boundaries and a clear cytoplasm. In addition to areas of conventional chondrosarcoma, there are partially mineralized trabecular osteoid formations. On the basis of 16 cases of clear-cell chondrosarcoma, we present the observations of the Hamburg Bone Tumor Register. The cases were examined according to age distribution, location, and radiological and pathomorphological criteria. The proximal femur was the most frequent location; rare manifestations in the rib, os ilium, and distal phalanx of the hand were also present. In 50% of the cases high-malignant osteosarcoma or conventional chondrosarcoma was considered. In addition to the epiphysis of the proximal femur, clear-cell chondrosarcoma can also involve other, rather unusual sites in the skeleton. Knowledge of the histomorphology of this tumor is therefore of crucial importance for the diagnosis.","2161":"Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults. In recent years a number of \"new\" entities and variants have been described. Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy. Chondroid lipoma, myolipoma, and purely cutaneous spindle-cell\/pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically. Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis. Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma. The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.","2162":"Whether heterozygotes with alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency type PiZ bear an increased risk for chronic liver disease is controversial. On the basis of liver tissue from 1,030 autopsies (autopsy series), 1,847 biopsies (biopsy series) and 317 primary liver carcinomas (tumor series), we analysed the effect of heterozygous state PiZ for the development of liver diseases. The PiZ status was screened immunohistochemically and verified in selected cases by SSCP analysis and by sequencing DNA extracted from paraffin embedded tissue. The PiZ frequency in the biopsy series (3.4%) and tumor series (5.99%) was significantly higher than in the autopsy series (1.8%). Hepatic PiZ deposits in heterozygotes sometimes were as extensive as in homozygotes. The amount of PiZ deposits correlated positively with the inflammatory activity and stage of fibrosis, as well as with the age of patients. Patients with concurrent liver disease such as hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease showed significantly higher scores of inflammatory activity, stage of fibrosis and amount of PiZ deposits than those without additional liver disease. Cholangiocarcinomas and combined hepato-cholangiocarcinomas were seen significantly more frequently in patients with PiZ-associated liver carcinoma than in genetic healthy individuals (p = 0.004). Three out of 19 PiZ-associated liver carcinomas had developed in cirrhotic liver tissue. Heterozygotes of type PiZ have an enhanced risk for chronic liver disease including primary liver carcinoma. PiZ-associated liver diseases will become clinically manifest in middle or old aged adults. Rarely this genetic defect causes liver cirrhosis even without concurrent liver disease. PiZ-associated liver carcinomas are frequently characterized by cholangiocellular differentiation and may develop often in non-cirrhotic liver tissue. Immunohistochemistry is a specific method to detect hepatic PiZ deposits.","2163":null,"2164":"Therapy and prognosis of lung cancer depend crucially on tumor size, tumor stage, and the histomorphological tumor type at the time of primary diagnosis. A tumor weighing only 1 g and barely detectable by clinical examination consists of about 1 x 10(9) tumor cells. The primary histological diagnosis is generally based on small biopsies 1-2 mm in diameter, which allow the assessment of only a few up to some hundred tumor cells in a section of 4 microns. Until 20 years ago light microscopic and histochemical investigations were the basis for sophisticated morphological tumor diagnosis. In recent years electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, cytometry, and molecular biology have extended our knowledge of the complex tumor biology, with the range of phenotypes and genotypes indicating enormous tumor heterogeneity. The value, expressiveness, and prognostic importance of these laborious and expensive techniques must be examined in studies, keeping in mind new aspects of tumor classification. Histological and cytological findings are still the decisive basis for the primary diagnosis of the pathologist in any given case.","2165":"","2166":"","2167":"The occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy. Chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion. The important criteria for differential diagnosis are neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells or their ductular morphology without atypia.","2168":"Prenatal examination of fetuses can now yield excellent findings and, by means of Doppler technology, can also reveal functional changes. Despite progress in fetal diagnostics, quality control of prenatal diagnoses remains necessary since prenatal findings can be the basis for deciding whether to perform preterm abortion. This is possible only by autopsy, and therefore increasing demands for precision are being placed on autoptic procedures. This is particularly the case in malformations, which can be associated with a specific syndrome and then become decisive in the context of family counseling of the parents in question. The pathologist must therefore go beyond the requirements of a standard autopsy in order to obtain thorough findings with respect to the fetus and the placenta. We describe an examination strategy for the stepwise elucidation of special and rare fetal conditions the autopsy of fetuses that is intended to provide support in decision making.","2169":"Ductal carcinoma in situ of the female breast and lobular carcinoma in situ are regarded as precursor lesions of invasive breast cancer. We used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze the genetic relationship between these two types of lesion and invasive breast cancer. The series included 166 patients with ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer. Our results reflect the broad heterogeneity of morphologically different subtypes of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer. The data also provide evidence of multiple genetic pathways of invasive breast cancer associated with different morphological subtypes. In conclusion, we propose a combined model of morphological-genetic progression with various parallel pathways in the pathogenesis of invasive breast cancer.","2170":"Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age. Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain. The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies. Internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made. To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed. The project \"Brain-Net\" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.","2171":"We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two. Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma. The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years. From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC. However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely. These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.","2172":"","2173":"","2174":"","2175":"A case of sudden and unexpected death of a 29-year-old man during a basketball game is reported. Six years before death a transient ischemic attack and a membranous glomerulonephritis were diagnosed. The autopsy revealed as cause of death to be a severe lymphoplasmocytic coronariitis and, in addition, a small single focus of a lymphoplasmocytic aortitis, indicating a systemic disease. A suspected syphilitic vasculitis could not be confirmed. In the literature there are few cases of similar coronary arteriitis are described, such as Takayasu's type of arteriitis in men of young and middle age.","2176":null,"2177":"We describe four cases of acardius (one of hemiacardius, two of holoacardius acephalus, and one of the holacardius amorphus) and present the current range of therapeutic possibilities: control of amniotic fluid by repeated amniocentesis or indomethacin therapy, administration of digoxin to the mother, selective preterm delivery of the acardiac twin by hysterotomy, interruption of the anastomoses by injection of thrombogenic coils, sclerosing agents, umbilical cord ligation, fetoscopic laser coagulation, and thermocoagulation.","2178":"True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding. During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk. We describe the special features of diagnosis, histology, and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries. We recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications.","2179":"Bone marrow biopsy plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Further diagnostic methods need to be established to increase accuracy in the light of advances over recent years in the immunophenotypical characterization of discrete lymphatic bone marrow lesions and the continuing difficulty in classifying them. This study compared the diagnostic value of flow cytometry to that of conventional bone marrow biopsy in 156 patients with 191 marrow biopsy specimens or bone marrow aspirates. The most important findings were that up to one-third of lymphomas could not be diagnosed by flow cytometry, and that the degree of infiltration was estimated as less than two-thirds. However, flow cytometric results were more satisfactory in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In summary, flow cytometry has a complementary role in the staging of lymphoma but cannot fully replace conventional trephine biopsy.","2180":"Pituitary necroses develop from the interruption of circulation in the pituitary stalk, especially due to shock, trauma, etc. We studied the incidence, extent, and outcome of necroses in postmortem series from 1991 to 1998 and compared these with the findings in our own study in the 1970s. Necroses were classified into four degrees based on the proportion of anterior pituitary volume: grade I, up to 5%; grade II, 5-10%; grade III, 10-50%; grade IV, more than 50%. The data show a decreased incidence of necrosis, from 7.7% in the 1970s to 3.1% in the 1990s. Scars, indicating former necroses, decreased in incidence from 11.4% to 3.6%. The changes in the four grades of necrosis were: a decrease in grade I from 60% to 41%, a decrease in grade II from 24% to 22%, an increase in grade III from 9% to 17%, and an increase in IV from 8% to 20%. These figures reveal that pituitary necroses became less frequent but more extensive. Necroses of grade IV are generally caused by more than a single cause. The decreased incidence appears to be the consequence of progress in intensive care over the past 20 years, as patients can now survive severe shock longer. The increased frequency of intensive necroses is probably due to the longer period for greater extent of necrosis to develop during intensive care.","2181":"","2182":"","2183":"","2184":"We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoea. Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung. Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes. These tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed HMB-45 and protein S-100 immunohistochemically. Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis. A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed. Histology revealed an angiomyolipoma. The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases. Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis. The peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express HMB-45. This has not been reported yet.","2185":"One rare case of POEMS syndrome is presented. In a 39-year-old male patient a progressive numbness in hands and feet developed within 5 years. Admission with increasing dyspnoea and lower leg edema. In swollen inguinal lymph nodes a lymphadenopathy with angiofollicular hyperplasia and vascular-plasmacellular proliferation was diagnosed and classified as Castleman-like histologic features. In os ilium an osteosclerotic plasmocytoma with restriction of kappa light chains was found. Potential pathomechanism of POEMS syndrome are discussed.","2186":"We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region. At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction. Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node. To our knowledge, this is the first report of co-existence of these two rare cardiac tumors.","2187":"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases. The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS. This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare. Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed. After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott). It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.","2188":"As a result of the quality of prenatal ultrasound and the expanded experience of prenatal diagnosticians, it is possible to observe congenital heart malformations in increasingly greater detail and at an ever earlier stage of gestation [4]. Since it is on the basis of ultrasound findings that decisions to terminate pregnancies are made, it is of cardinal importance that after termination monitoring and confirmation of the prenatal diagnosis be carried out. This need can only be adequately met by autopsy. There are different methods for carrying out autopsies when there is suspicion of a congenital heart defect: a) the Anderson sequential segmental analysis as modified according to the Berlin method; b) use of a special autoptic method corresponding to the ultrasound findings, based on defining a preferred sectional plane; c) stereomicroscopically; or d) microscopically after embedding and preparation of serial microscopic sections. For the pathologist the consequence is that he has to adapt his autopsy method to the ultrasound findings and the age of the fetus. This enables him to determine an optimal, case-based autopsy strategy for each type of cardiac defect, which is essential for monitoring of the prenatal diagnosis. The present paper discusses the various autoptic methods used in cases of congenital heart malformations and the consequences for the pathologist of the continuing improvements in prenatal diagnostics.","2189":"The ABBI (advanced breast biopsy instrumentation) system has only recently been available for diagnostic excisional biopsy of small, non-palpable lesions of the breast. Between 1.1.1998 and 31.3.1999 this method was utilized in 40 patients with suspicious microcalcifications (n = 25), newly developed densities (n = 11) and a combination of microcalcifications and densities (n = 4). In 12 cases malignancy was diagnosed, in 11 cases a subsequent resection was performed. In every case sufficient tissue for diagnosis was obtained, in not a single case the diagnosis had to be revised in case of subsequent resection. Orientation within the specimen is accurate, the resection margins can be judged unequivocally. Any necessary special examinations can be performed on the resected tissue. In our experience, ABBI is a valuable and elegant tool for diagnosing small suspicious lesions of the breast.","2190":"Sideroelastosis pulmonum was first described by Ceelen (1931) and Gellerstedt (1939), mentioning an idiopathic type, but also vascular alterations in chronic pulmonary congestion. We analysed the question wether secondary sideroelastosis can be demonstrated also in lungs after previous welder dust exposure. Lung samples of 43 patients and deceased with various exposure periods to welder dust were investigated. On each sample, light microscopical, scan electron microscopical and energy dispersive x-ray micro analyses (EDX) were performed. In six samples (14%) vascular alterations in the area of denaturated elastic fibres with siderophilic \"impregnation\" were seen, corresponding to the features described by von Ceelen and Gellerstedt. Giant cell or granulomatous reactions, however, were present only in exceptional cases. This phenomenon was seen mostly in cases of marked local siderin deposits and reactive fibrosis. Using EDX, a number of metals characteristic for welder dust (Al, Ti, Cr, Ni) as well as iron were found in siderophages. No other metal than iron was detected in siderophilic elastic fibres using EDX. Causal pathogenetically, a correlation between increased iron uptake connected with welding particles and sideroelastosis of the vessel walls has to be established. However, in formal pathogenesis, other factors such as local perfusion disturbances due to fibrotic processes after exposure to harmful substances must be taken into consideration.","2191":"PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology. We summarize our experience in this area based on 3500 analyses performed during the past 5 years. The peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of DNA fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation. For this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation. PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.","2192":"Recently the World Health Organization published a new classification of urinary bladder tumors which is intended to take into account better the biology of the various lesions and to better distinguish between clearly benign and malignant lesions. We examine the possible diagnostic and clinical impact of the new classification, including recent immunohistochemical findings. Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary neoplasms of low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas. Flat urothelial lesions include hyperplasia, reactive atypia\/atypia of unknown significance, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. Invasive patterns of papillary carcinomas are discussed, with special emphasis on lamina muscularis mucosae substaging. The most important feature of the new classification is its differentiation of two types of low-grade, noninvasive papillary urothelial lesions: papillary neoplasm of low malignant potential vs. papillary carcinoma. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of this differentiation.","2193":"Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma. The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years. Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogeneous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis. The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis. Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependent on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma. It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts. In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification scheme.","2194":"Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%). They are characterized by an aggressive clinical course. These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma. In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common. The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum. Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group. This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas. There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes. The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell\/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immuno-phenotypical and genetic findings. In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities. A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i.e. plasma-blastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.","2195":"Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MCL) of extranodal, nodal and splenic origin appear to be different lymphoma entities with a similar growth pattern in the marginal zone of the B-follicles. Decisive for the detection of MCL as a distinct lymphoma entity was the \"MALT concept\" for lymphoid infiltrates in the gastric and intestinal mucosa as described by Isaacson et al. in the 1980's. Immunohistological stainings for the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains and molecular pathological studies of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene configuration have subsequently confirmed the neoplastic nature of the extranodal infiltrates and differentiated marginal zone cells from mantle zone cells. In 1994, the MCL of MALT type as well as of nodal and splenic origin were included in the REAL classification and in 1998 in the new WHO classification for lymphomas. Meanwhile extranodal MCL of MALT-type have been observed in almost every organ and site of the body, by far most frequently in the gastric mucosa. Beside the typical growth pattern, lymphoepithelial lesions are a distinct diagnostic feature of extranodal MCL. Clinically, the small cell extranodal MCL show a very good prognosis with regression after treatment. As for nodal and splenic MCL, we need further studies to evaluate the prognostic aspects and to compare them with other B-cell lymphomas. The same is true for primary extranodal large B-cell lymphomas or blastic transformation to a large cell lymphoma; in these tumors the diagnosis of a MALT type lymphoma should only be made if a small cell component with MALT-specific criteria can be proved.","2196":"Similar to the R.E.A.L-System, the small cell B-cell lymphomas of the new WHO classification consist of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia of B cell type, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma\/immunocytoma, hairy cell leukaemia, as well as plasmacytoma. The only major difference between the WHO- and the REAL-classification is the consideration of prolymphocytic leukaemia as a single disease entity in the former system. All the above-mentioned lymphomas arise from B cells of varying stages of differentiation and, therefore, often demonstrate architectural, cytological and immunophenotypic characteristics of their normal physiological counterparts. Consideration of tumour cell growth pattern, -cytology, -immunophenotype and -growth fraction, together with the presence and consistency of the reactive cell infiltrate, usually leads to categorisation of a lymphoma in the majority of cases. The molecular biological characteristics of follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma are the best defined of the small cell B-cell lymphomas. Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and the bcl-2 gene or Cyclin D1 gene, respectively, probably belong to the initial changes in a cell, which, together with several subsequent unidentified genetic alterations, lead to the development of these tumours. Although nodal small cell B-cell lymphomas are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease, the progression of the disease--with the exception of mantle cell lymphomas--is often indolent. As a result, the small cell B-cell lymphomas were previously considered as \"low-grade\" Non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the Kiel classification. However, since the progress of a lymphoma subtype can be heterogeneous and since mantle cell lymphomas cannot really be considered as \"low-grade\" tumours, \"umbrella grading\" of lymphomas has been discarded in the WHO classification, with emphasis being placed on grading within a lymphoma disease entity. In the following pages, the characteristics important for the diagnosis and categorisation of the small cell B-cell lymphomas will be summarised. Further, we present information regarding the molecular biological and clinical characteristics of these lymphomas.","2197":"Malignant lymphomas, originating from peripheral T or NK cells, are rare tumours in Europe and account for less than 10% of all malignant lymphomas. In this review, the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from T or NK cells will be presented. Nasal NK\/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis. The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus. Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating, in the majority of cases, a derivation of these tumors from NK cells. Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis. The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4. Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8. Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified. Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis. Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis. The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dys-regulated immune response). Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified. These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.","2198":"Fifteen years after their first description by one of the authors (HS) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALC-lymphoma, ALCL) now represents a generally accepted group of large cell lymphomas. Essential defining features comprise of a proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 and a characteristic growth pattern. Using molecular and clinical criteria three entities of ALC-lymphoma have been identified: primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALC-lymphoma, primary systemic ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma and primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma. The ALK expression in the primary systemic ALC-lymphoma entity is caused by chromosomal translocations, most commonly t(2;5), and can nowadays be reliably detected by immuno-histology. ALK-positive ALC-lymphoma predominantly affects young male patients and if treated with chemotherapy has a favourable prognosis. They show a broad morphological spectrum, with the \"common type\", the small cell variant and the lymphohistiocytic variant being most commonly observed. The knowledge of the existence of these variants is essential in establishing the correct diagnosis. ALK-negative ALC-lymphomas occur in older patients, equally affecting both genders and have an unfavorable prognosis. The morphology and the immuno-phenotype of primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma shows an overlap with that of lymphomatoid papulosis. Both diseases have an excellent prognosis and secondary systemic dissemination is only rarely observed. The ALC-lymphomas described above derive from T cells and are generally accepted as biological entities. In contrast, large B-cell-lymphomas with anaplastic morphology are now believed not to represent an own entity but a morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Malignant lymphomas with morphological features of both Hodgkin- and ALC-lymphoma have formerly been classified as ALCL Hodgkin-like. Recent immuno-histological analysis of these cases however suggests that ALCL Hodgkin-like does not represent an own lymphoma entity. Most of these cases are likely to be examples of tumor cell rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while a minority of these cases appear to fall either into the category of ALK-positive or ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma.","2199":"In the last few years our understanding of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has enormously progressed. Molecular analysis has revealed that almost all cases of this disease are clonal B cell neoplasms, therefore the term Hodgkin's lymphoma instead of Hodgkin's disease is being proposed in the new WHO classification. Lymphocyte predominance HL (LPHL) differs in respect to morphology, immunophenotype and clinical features from the other forms of HL and represents its own distinct entity. In addition to morphologic features (nodularity, presence of L&amp;H cells) the immuno-phenotype of tumor cells is most important in establishing a diagnosis of LPHL, and particularly in differentiating LPHL from the other forms of HL. The remaining forms of HL (nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte depletion) display a mostly identical antigen profile and similar clinical characteristics, they are therefore grouped together in the REAL classification under the heading of classical HL. Recent immuno-histological analysis have revealed that one third of HL cases, which formerly were classified as LPHL, display the immuno-phenotype of classical HL. These cases are now considered to represent examples of classical HL and termed nodular lymphocyte rich classical HL. According to retrospective clinico-pathological analysis, the biological behaviour of this newly identified form of classical HL also differs from LPHL. Differences between classical HL and LPHL also occur on the molecular level. Thus LPHL often displays ongoing mutations of the immunoglobulin genes, and the tumor cells express immunoglobulin protein and transcripts, while these characteristics are absent in classical HL. Since peripheral B cells that do not express immunoglobulins die from apoptosis, these findings imply that the regulation of apoptosis is defective in Hodgkin and Sternberg Reed cells. Several laboratories are currently working intensely to clarify the defective apoptosis pathway in HL.","2200":null,"2201":"For decades, rival classification systems for malignant lymphoma that were hardly even comparable have existed side by side: the Kiel Classification has so far been used in the German-speaking parts of Europe and the \"Working Formulation\" mainly in the USA. At the beginning of the 1990's it became possible to overcome this unsatisfactory situation, when pathologists in the Old and New Worlds joined forces to elaborate a new classification for lymphoma, the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) Classification, based on current scientific data. One new feature is the absence of a malignancy grading that is applicable to more than one entity. The system centres on the definition of distinct lymphomatous diseases that can be diagnosed with a high degree of reproducibility. Morphological and clinical characteristics are used for diagnosis, but so, consistently, are immuno-phenotypical and molecular genetic ones. An international cooperative study has confirmed the high reproducibility and clinical practicability of this tentative classification system. An international panel of pathologists appointed by the World Health Organization has updated the REAL classification, which is expected to be published in the updated version in 2001 under the title New WHO Classification. The articles that follow are based on the new WHO classification.","2202":"Histological findings as regards localizing a lesion suspected to be a tumor and its relation to the margins of a surgical specimen have to be as precise as possible and beyond all doubt. We report on our experience with two technical tools which are especially helpful in excisions of breast tissue: 1) Radiopaque suture material fixed intraoperatively simplifies the correlation of postoperative mammography, X-ray findings with biopsy specimens. 2) AgNO(3), as a solution or in stick form, is faster than ink or other dyes, in marking the margins in small or large surgical specimens because virtually no drying is required.","2203":"Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease characterized by intravascular growth of lymphoma cells in small vessels. Most frequently, its first manifestations occur in the central nervous system or skin. Based on autoptical findings in a 68-year-old-man with IVL, the pathological morphology in the central nervous system is compared to the course of neurological symptoms. The disease could not be diagnosed during his lifetime. The spectrum of neurological deficits can be explained histopathologically by occlusive intravascular aggregations of lymphomatous cells in small vessels of the spinal leptomeninges and nerve roots causing perfusion deficits and areas of ischemic necrosis of up to 4 mm in diameter in the medulla. Aggregations of lymphoma cells in the vessels of other organs are also found, but did not result in clinical symptoms. In reference to the present case, a survey of other literature reports on IVL with neurological and psychiatric manifestations is given. In patients with this condition, even an invasive biopsy has to be considered in order to make the correct diagnosis at an early clinical stage.","2204":"Granulocytic sarcomas (so-called chloromas) are rare extramedullary tumorlike proliferates of myelogenous precursor cells that may de novo precede acute leukemia or coincide with the first manifestation or relapse of acute myeloid leukemia. Rarely, such tumors represent the initial manifestation of a blast crisis in the course of a chronic myeloproliferative disease, such as chronic myeloid leukemia. If they occur in aleukemic patients incorrect diagnoses may result. Differential diagnostic considerations are being discussed by presenting the case of a 58-year-old man who experienced spinal cord compression by an isolated epidural mass lesion.","2205":"A total of 123 manifestations (97 primary tumours and 26 metastases) of neuroendocrine tumours of the gastrointestinal tract observed in 95 patients was investigated for the prognostic value of clinical, histological and DNA cytophotometric parameters. Metastases almost exclusively occurred among ileal carcinoids, which also were responsible for all 14 cases of lethal outcome observed during the follow-up period of mean 42 months. Aneuploid DNA values could be determined significantly more frequently among ileal than in non-ileal carcinoids and showed - upon analysis of the total group of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours - a significant correlation to lethal course of disease. In addition, among 18 cases with primary and secondary carcinoid manifestations available for DNA cytophotometry, an association between the DNA content of metastatic neuroendocrine tumours and prognosis came to light. When applied to the group of ileal neoplasms, however, the parameter DNA content did not allow a better prognostic assessment.","2206":"The broad spectrum of clinical and hematological as well as histomorphological findings at diagnosis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) is significantly associated with prognosis. However, in this context the impact of bone marrow histology is still being controversially discussed. This feature applies to CML in particular. Therefore, risk classification is mainly based on clinical data. In order to evaluate the predictive value of bone marrow morphology we performed a retrospective study on a total of 1023 patients with CMPDs. Relative survival rates and a disease-specific loss of life expectancy were calculated to adjust the age- and gender-specific mortality in older patients. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) showed an average life expectancy of 5 years, with significantly longer survival times under interferon treatment. In contrast, the ET group did not disclose any relevant reduction in life expectancy. Initial bone marrow fibrosis and a reduction in erythropoiesis were the most important prognostic features in CML. Furthermore, Pseudo-Gaucher cells indicated a favorable outcome in the cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy. On the other hand, peripheral myelo- and erythroblasts were correlated with a worsening in survival. Regarding IMF, a simplified multivariate risk score was constructed, including age, hemoglobin level, platelet and leukocyte counts, and a leuko-erythroblastic blood picture as most important variables. The three risk groups derived showed significantly different survival patterns, but in this calculation bone marrow histology exerted no major influence on survival. On the other hand, initial (prefibrotic) stages of IMF revealed a better prognosis. In conclusion, our results underline the importance of bone marrow morphology in CMPDs, since significant correlations with patients' outcome were calculated. Particularly in CML, myelofibrosis and reduction of erythropoiesis were associated with survival and, thus, must be regarded as important predictive and independent parameters.","2207":"Apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow. Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters. However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism. A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study. Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II alpha expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1. Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2\/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle. Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed. On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity. Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index. In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase. Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation. In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics. In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and\/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.","2208":"An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy. Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61(+) megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density. This finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis. The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis. In a similar way, the frequency of CD68(+) macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f(+) nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts. The (alpha-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens. Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size. These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML. Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out. This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data. Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU. The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices. These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time. Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68(+) macrophages, including activated subpopulations. Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients. This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy. In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.","2209":"Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (&gt; or =500x10(9)\/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD). In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact. Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment. While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q(-) syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance. In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered. A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account. Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular. In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF. In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET). Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.","2210":"Differentiation of an elevated hemoglobin\/hematocrit level warrants not only the determination of relevant laboratory values, including erythropoietin, but also an elaborate evaluation of bone marrow histopathology. Particularly in the initial stages of polycythemia vera (PV), when not all stringent clinical criteria are completely fulfilled, a more refined analysis of morphological features helps to distinguish autonomous (PV) from spurious or secondary erythrocytosis - polyglobuly (PG). PV is characterized by a panmyelosis, i.e., a trilinear proliferation of all cell lineages, whereas in PG erythropoiesis predominates. Megakaryopoiesis exerts a significant impact on differentiation, because in PV there is a conspicuous grouping associated with a strikingly expressed pleomorphous appearance. This peculiar feature implicates assemblies of small- to medium-sized megakaryocytes lying adjacent to giant cells with extensively lobulated, staghorn-like nuclei. A further discriminating parameter is presented by the interstitial lesions frequently occurring in PG. These, according to the usually underlying inflammatory cause (chronic bronchitis-recurrent bronchopneumonias), include iron-laden macrophages, a prominent perivascular plasmacytosis, phagocytosis of cell debris by histiocytic reticular cells and often an in- crease in the number of eosinophils. Comparable findings are not, or only to a minor ex-tent, detectable in PV. In conclusion, by regarding hematopoiesis and the myeloid stroma initial stages of PV may be definitively distinguished from PG.","2211":"Differentiation of focal or extended lymphoid bone marrow infiltrates presents a diagnostic challenge and therefore warrants systematic evaluation of those features which affect this. One of the basic requirements is an appropriate technique of processing the bone marrow specimens. This includes the possibility of enzyme evaluation (naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate esterase) and immunohistochemistry (set of monoclonal antibodies) and comparison with the corresponding lymph node histology. A number of histological parameters have emerged with a distinctive property for distinguishing between reactive focal lymphoid aggregates and malignant lymphomas. Amongst these the pattern of infiltrates, i.e., histotopography (subcortical infiltrates, paratrabcular-endosteal localization, margination, tandem-like extension between adipocytes and cribriform appearance), content of reticulin fibers, cytology (small lymphocytes versus large blast cells) and, finally, immunohistochemistry (monoclonal versus polyclonal expression of cytoplasmic immunoglobulins, uniform versus mixed population of B or T lymphocytes) are most important. In conclusion, synoptic consideration of several parameters, in particular histotopography and immunohistochemistry provides a most promising approach to differentiate neoplastic from reactive lymphoid lesions in the bone marrow.","2212":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of clonal stem cell disorders which generally occur in older adults but may also affect children. Primary MDS should be distinguished from secondary MDS associated with antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy (t-MDS), exposure to toxic compounds, or genetic disorders. The establishment of a neoplastic clone is reflected by dysplastic features and impaired function which may affect all three hematopoietic cell lineages. The ineffective hematopoiesis which causes bone marrow failure is accompanied by peripheral blood cytopenia and is considered to result from increased apoptosis, at least in the less advanced MDS stages. The elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of MDS has provided evidence that chromosomal abnormalities are present in about 50% of patients with primary MDS. They include numerical aberrations such as monosomy 5 or 7, trisomy 8, loss of the Y-chromosome and structural abnormalities such as deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-syndrome), 7, or 8. Based on the percentage of blasts (&lt;5%, 5-20%, 20-30%) and the presence of &gt;15% ringed sideroblasts for marrows with &lt;5% blasts, the French-American-British (FAB) classifies MDS into 4 morphologic categories: refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. The fifth morphologic type is chronic myelomonocytic leukemia characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis (&gt;1x10(9)\/l). However, a modification of this classification will be proposed by the World Health Organization, with the intention of lowering the threshold for the diagnosis of AML from 30% to 20% blast cells. In patients presenting with cytopenias suggesting impaired hematopoiesis, the initial diagnosis depends mainly on the cytological evaluation of bone marrow and blood smears and the histological findings of trephine bone marrow biopsy. In a retrospective analysis we evaluated the occurrence of the distinct FAB-categories as percentage of the total number of MDS cases diagnosed at the Institute of Pathology of the University of Freiburg. A total of 63% fullfilled the criteria of RA\/RARS, 17% of RAEB, 14% of RAEB-t, and 6% of CMML. A fibrotic variant of MDS was observed in 7.67% of all cases, ranging from 2.34% in RA up to 15. 42-15.84% in the categories which did not show significant differences with regard to myelofibrosis. The histologic evaluation of a trephine bone marrow biopsy is of critical importance for the evaluation of fibrotic or hypocellular MDS since these patterns are not reflected by the cytological examination. The combined cytological and histological diagnosis of bone marrow and peripheral blood is a reliable tool for the initial diagnosis of MDS. In addition, cytogenetic and molecular analysis should be performed. Presently, the risk of leukemic transformation is evaluated using the International Prognostic Scoring System for MDS, which is the sum of the scores of bone marrow blasts, karyotypes and cytopenia. In the context of clinical trials therapeutic modalities should be considerd according to the age and the general performance state and the prognostic scores of individual patients.","2213":"","2214":"","2215":"","2216":"","2217":"","2218":"","2219":"","2220":"","2221":"","2222":"","2223":"","2224":"","2225":"","2226":"","2227":"Restrictive dermopathy is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive, congenital skin disease.

Polyhydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia are distinctive manifestations, leading to respiratory insufficiency and premature delivery at about 31 weeks of gestation. We report on a case of a prematurely born infant who presented with the typical morphological features and describe the light- and electron-microscopical findings as described in the literature.","2228":"Primary sarcomas of the liver are rare.

It has been observed most often in the ovaries, uterus, and cervix. An extragenital localization is less frequent and usually an asymptomatic, incidental finding. We report on a 32-year-old woman in her third trimester of pregnancy who developed acute appendicitis caused by ectopic decidua. This case illustrates a rare differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis and discusses the pathogenesis of pregnancy-associated ectopic decidua in such cases.","2230":"We report on a 62-year-old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically. Histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon. No other organs were found affected. In the course of an antibiotic therapy, there was no melena detectable over a period of six months. Malakoplakia, an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract, is rarely found in the colon, with only 35 cases published until now. It is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders, immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse. This spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long-standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease.","2231":"We report on a 12-year old boy suffering from malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver, which is a very rare tumor in childhood. The tumor was detected by ultrasound examination at the age of 10 and appeared at that time as a solitary intrahepatic nodular lesion. During the following 2 years multiple nodular lesions developed in both hepatic lobes. There were neither any suspect anamnestic findings nor abnormal clinical or laboratory data. The tumor showed the typical histomorphological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of this entity, which is usually seen in older patients. We investigated proliferative activity, apoptotic regulation, and expression of VEGF and VEGF-receptor flk-1 by means of immunohistochemical techniques. According to the known slow growth activity of these tumors we found only a few Ki-67 positive tumor cells. We did not detect any apoptotic cells using TUNEL technique. The positive immunoreaction of the tumor cells with antibodies against VEGF and VEGF-receptor flk-1 may indicate the regulation of tumor growth by angiogenetic factors. We present our findings together with a summary of the most important publications of recent years concerning these tumors.","2232":null,"2233":"A meningioma with cartilaginous areas is described. The tumour arose in the region of the right sphenoid wing in a 74-year-old woman. Histologically, it showed large areas of a typical meningothelial meningioma, among which numerous cartilaginous islands and some chondroid regions, obviously of intermediate (meningothelial\/cartilaginous) differentiation, could be seen. Cartilaginous tumour areas showed lower MIB1-labelling indices than typical meningioma regions, where an increased proliferative activity was seen focally. The current WHO classification lists such tumours as metaplastic meningiomas, reflecting the potential of meningioma cells for mesenchymal differentiation. Metaplastic meningiomas may show different metaplasias (xanthomatous, osseous, lipomatous, cartilaginous, etc.). Extensive cartilaginous metaplasias are very uncommon. Identification of typical meningioma areas is the key for the diagnosis of this meningioma variant.","2234":"A series of six cases of chondroid lipoma is reported in this paper. The age of the patients, four women and two men, ranged from 34 to 75 years. Four tumours arose in the lower and two in the upper extremities between 4.5 and 8 cm in size. Whereas two neoplasms were located in the subcutis, four lesions were seen in perifascial or intramuscular tissues. Histologically, all neoplasms were encapsulated and characterized by a somewhat lobular growth pattern. The neoplasms were composed of mature adipocytes, uni - and multivacuolated lipoblasts, and nests and strands of cells reminiscent to hibernoma cells or chondrocytes. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally the lipogenic nature of the latter type of cells was confirmed. Interestingly, focal immunopositivity of tumour cells for cytokeratin was found in two cases. Tumour cells were set in a myxohyaline matrix showing different degrees of degeneration. Chondroid lipoma represents a distinct entity in the spectrum of lipomatous lesions and has to be distinguished from benign and malignant neoplasms (extraskeletal chondroma, hibernoma, lipoblastoma, chondrolipoangioma, myoepithelioma, myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma, and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma). Because they are easily misdiagnosed as malignant tumours, familiarity with the features of chondroid lipoma is of practical importance to avoid an overtreatment.","2235":"DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification. In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated. In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67\/MIB1 labeling index were determined. DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index. Statistical evaluation revealed a highly significant correlation between recurrence-free interval and WHO-grade only. The DNA parameters, however, furnished additional information about increasing genetic instability in the majority of the recurrencies independently of changes in the WHO-grade. They thus seem to be useful as additional parameters for the determination of glioma progression.","2236":"","2237":"","2238":"","2239":"","2240":"Additions and use of an epidiascope are described, which may be used after minor modifications for presenting whole organs and organ slices in lectures on general and systemic pathology, saving the installation of sophisticated video equipment with additional lighting etc.","2241":"","2242":"Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from Black African patients.

Pathologists of Latvia were members of the German Association of Pathology. The stages of political changes in Europe very much influenced the exchanges of ideas. The following presentation will outline the activities and personalities in the sector of pathology in the time period until 1918--time of the Russian Czar Empire--, during the National State of Latvia and the Second World War (1918-1940), then during the Russian occupation of Latvia (1944-1991) and also the new time period after the political changes. Evaluated in this presentation the yearly support of the Baltic\/German Symposiums, assisted by the IAP, which in addition to the activities in pathology also promote and encourage many personal contacts and friendships.","2246":"Immunohistochemical staining techniques, such as the APAAP, ABC, EnVision and Immuf1p4x methods, play a leading role in the search to solve the questions arising in clinical diagnosis. With the increase in number of techniques for diagnostic examination, the sarch for suitable method is becoming more and more important. The goal of this study was to compare these different treatments with regard to sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, an analysis of time and cost was made. The primary antibodies used were CD20, CD30 and IgM, as well as receptor antibodies estrogen and progesterone. The variable costs of each technique were calculated based on selected examples. The APAAP method required the most time and was, at the same time, by far the most expensive treatment. The EnVision method required the least time and showed very good staining results, which were comparable to those of the ABC and ImmunoMax techniques. The staining costs could be reduced by about 95% and the staining intensity improved substantially by using expensive receptor antibodies in combination with the Immuno-Max method. This study illustrates the importance of knowing different examination techniques, as well as the costs arising by their usage.","2247":"Squamous cell carcinoma as a late complication of chronic osteomyelitis is a well known phenomenon in traumatology, often occurring as a consequence of bone fractures. The majority of cases are observed in men between 50 and 60 years of age. The time from onset of inflammatory bone disease to malignant transformation differs but usually takes 30 years. In general, prognosis is thought to be favorable when adequate surgical therapy is carried out. Nowadays, it is important to recall this condition, because it has become rare. The cases reported here illustrate the difficulties that may be encountered in diagnosing malignant transformation, especially in lesions that develop in deep tissue layers and which may be responsible for various biopsies failing to reveal the true pathology.","2248":"","2249":"Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign bone tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all bone tumors. The peak age incidence is the second and third decade of life. Chondromyxoid fibrom occurs in the metaphyseal parts of the major tubular bones, predominantly of the lower extremity. Roentgenograms show, in most cases, a well-demarcated radiolucent lesion. The classic histological feature of a chondromyxoid fibroma is stellate or spindle-shaped cells arranged in lobules in a myxoid or chondroid background. Analysis of 40 chondromyxoid fibromas demonstrates the morphological variation of this tumor. Cases were examined for age distribution, localization, and radiological and histological features. In 85% we found the typical histomorphological pattern. Recurrence rate was 12.5%. In four cases the appearance was uncharacteristic and differentiation from other tumors such as chondroblastoma or chondrosarcoma was quite difficult. By adhering to strict histomorphological criteria, definite diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma can be made in most cases.","2250":"This article describes the historical development of the grading systems for malignant soft tissue tumors. The first attempts to grade these tumors were made in the middle of the nineteen century; a remarkable amount of activity in grading took place in the 1970s which reached a maximum in the 1980s. Reviewing the literature back to the first available publications, five phases in the development of the grading systems for malignant soft tissue tumors could be distinguished. Five commonly used systems were checked for comparing and handling of 339 patients with malignant soft tissue tumors. The use of two multifactorial systems, one simple and one complex, to grade malignant soft tissue tumors should be favored.","2251":"","2252":"The 100-year-history of Pathological Anatomy in Chemnitz is described by edification and fall of its buildings as well as the main dates of its leaders.

The article also refers to the involvement of Staemmler in Nazism and the injury done to Panofsky by it. The importance of the microbiological-hygienical departure during a long period is accented.","2253":"We report on a patient who at 61 years of age presented with two nodular melanomas in the right nasal cavity. These tumors were limited to the mucosal membrane and were accompanied by a large amount of atypical hyperplasia of the melanocytes within the glandular and surface epithelium of various other samples of the mucous membrane, a finding also verified immunohistochemically. These tumors were treated surgically. In the clinical course, after a prolonged tumor-free interval, a malignant melanoma of the contralateral nasal cavity occurred, in addition to recurrences in the area of the primary tumor. It seems likely that the large, diffuse proliferation of atypical melanocytes observed could have been the starting point of both the tumor recurrences and the second primary. Thus, in a histologically proven melanoma in the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory system, a more intense preoperative histological diagnostic procedure, in given cases with the assistance of immunohistochemical methods, could be useful to demonstrate intraepithelial atypical melanocytes. It is possible that by doing this the present poor prognosis for mucosal melanomas of the upper respiratory tract might be improved.","2254":"Multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare. There are only ten cases that have been previously described. Three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas, a so-called oncocytomatosis. This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy. In addition, we found an adrenal adenoma, a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung. In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas. Immunohistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative. These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium. CGH analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes. Coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare. Hitherto, coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described.","2255":"This is a case of a 46-years-old male patient with a long-standing history of lower abdominal complaints. A 6-cm measuring tumor was detected by CT and subsequently surgically removed. Classification of this tumor and prognosis was problematic in frozen section and paraffin-embedded material, including immunohistochemical studies. The immunohistochemical findings were compatible with myofibroblastic differentiation of tumor cells. The histologic pattern resembled a \"hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes\" as recently published. Even if there were certain discrepancies in the immunohistochemical findings in our case, we also recommended treating this tumor as a low-grade sarcoma. The malignancy was also supported by marked proliferative activity demonstrated by MIB 1\/KI 67 expression in numerous tumor cells. Finally, it has not yet been determined whether the hyalinizing spindle cell tumor is a pattern associated with a certain cellular differentiation or a pattern common to several mesenchymal tumor types.","2256":"One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented. In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma. As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed. The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature. The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.","2257":"A total of 70 malignant and 4 benign peritoneal mesotheliomas were diagnosed by the German Mesothelioma Registry between 1992 and 1998. Malignant mesotheliomas developed mainly in men (55\/70); only one man had a benign peritoneal alteration. Age at first diagnosis of malignant mesotheliomas is about 59 years; the women are on average 4 years younger than the men. Mean survival time ranges about 1 year; in 6 of 38 patients longer survival times of up to 7 years are known. The epitheloid subtype predominates, but no effect on survival time is noticed. The percentage of patients with combined asbestos-associated lung fibrosis is higher than that for pleural mesotheliomas; these patients become ill about 6.5 years earlier. The latency period is 36 years on average. For most patients asbestos exposure is related to their occupation mainly in metal industries, asbestos industries, and in the building trade. There is no evidence for an induction of benign peritoneal alterations by asbestos dust.","2258":"Argyrophilic grain disease (AgD) constitutes one cause of late onset dementia and is histologically characterized by the presence of abundant argyrophilic grains and coiled bodies. Both abnormalities are found mainly in limbic structures, among them the sector CA1 of the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and the amygdala. Using appropriate silver staining techniques, they are easily detectable and can easily be distinguished from neurofibrillary lesions of Alzheimer's disease (i.e., tangles and threads). Although the histopathology of AgD is well characterized, the nosological status is still unclear because most cases of AgD are associated with Alzheimer-type changes. For some authors, therefore, AgD is considered a variant of Alzheimer's disease rather than a distinct disease entity. The present review is aimed at presenting argyrophilic grain disease to a larger readership than just neuropathologists who are interested in neurodegenerative disorders. In this review we summarize morphological, immunohistochemical, clinico-pathological and genetic data obtained in more than 90 subjects with AgD. The main conclusions of this review are that AgD represents one of the most frequent, dementing disorders of old age and that it has to be clearly distinguished from Alzheimer's disease.","2259":"The rising numbers of tissue samples for securing a diagnosis has led to a multitude of tissue samples in pathology institutes.

Suspicion of interchanged samples occurs much more often than it actually happens; however, it is important to be aware of the possibility so as to inform the clinician and to eliminate any possible causes of the confusion. The civil and penal consequences of such an interchanging, the subsequent \"incorrect\" diagnosis and the therapeutic measures are secondary compared to the potentially dramatic consequences for the patient. Important causes for an interchanging and possible preventive measures are presented.","2260":"","2261":"","2262":"In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen. No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible. After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma. This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin. Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization. This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma. Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.","2263":"A tumor was removed from the right external auditory canal of a 69-year old female patient.

The advantages of using voice recognition are the creation of new documentation or archives, reduced personnel costs and, last but not least, independence in cases of unforeseen notification of illness or owing to annual leave. For voice recognition systems to be used easily, a considerable amount of time must be invested for the first 3 months. Younger colleagues in particular will be more motivated to dictate more precisely and more detailed because of the introduction of voice recognition. The effects on other sectors of medical training, quality control, histology report preparation, and transmission can only be speculated.","2266":null,"2267":"Until recently, benign cutaneous neural tumours which do not fulfil criteria for either neurofibrom or schwannoma often were lumped into the broad category of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours (PNST). However, during the last years a number of new entities of neural tumours have been described, and advances in immunohistochemistry and electronmicroscopy have helped us to better understand the cytological differentiation in these neoplasms. The knowledge of these distinctive neoplasms is necessary in order to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and misdiagnosis of more aggressive neoplasms. These distinctive lesions include: neurothekeoma, which can divided into classical myxoid and cellular types showing characteristic histological and immunohistochemical features. Typical neurothekeoma (nerve sheath myxoma) is a lobular or nodular dermal neoplasm composed of plump spindled or stellated, S-100 positive tumour cells set in a maxoid stroma. In contrast, cellular neurothekeoma is characterized as an ill-defined dermal neoplasm composed of concentric nests and fascicles of spindle-shaped and epithelioid tumour cells, which are S-100 negative but stain positively for NKIC3. The evidence of intermediate forms of neurothekeoma showing features of ordinary hypocellular neurothekeoma and cellular neurothekeoma, as well as ultrastructural studies, emphasize that both variants represent a spectrum of neurothekeoma; solitary circumscribed neuroma (\"palisaded encapsulated neuroma\") manifests mainly as a skin-colored or pink papule or nodule, and is most often located on the face. Histologically, solitary circumscribed neuroma is a well-circumscribed round or ovoid dermal neoplasm composed of interwoven fascicles of schwann cells, which stain positively for S-100 protein and numerous neurofilament positive axons surrounded partly by fibroblasts and EMA-positive perineural cells; perineurioma is a rare well-circumscribed neoplasm which occurs mainly in subcutaneous tissue and only rarely in the dermis and in deep soft tissues. Perineurioma is composed of elongated bipolar spindle-shaped tumour cells which are arranged in storiform, whorled, linear or lamellated growth patterns, The tumour cells stain positively for vimentin and EMA, and for CD 34 in a number of cases, but lack positivity for S-100 protein, neurofilament and desmoplakin. In addition unusual forms of schwannoma (cellular schwannoma, solitary plexiform schwannoma, melanotic schwannoma) and neurofibroma (\"atypical\" (bizarre) neurofibroma, diffuse neurofibroma, epithelioid neurofibroma) are briefly discussed.","2268":"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most important and a very heterogeneous group of malignant soft tissue tumors of childhood and adolescence. The two major subtypes (embryonal and alveolar) share a common myogenic differentiation, but seem to be histogenetically not related. The so-called 'International Classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma' includes, besides the two major subtypes, the botryoid and leiomyomatous subtypes of embryonal RMS which are associated with a better prognosis and are treated less aggressively according to current protocols. In addition, the solid variant of alveolar RMS is included in the alveolar group of RMS. The identification of the various subtypes is necessary and important because the treatment with the current protocols is also related to histology. Using conventional stains and immunohistochemistry, these subtypes are distinguishable. Genetic analysis can be helpful in the demonstration of t(2;13) or t(1;13) translocations in alveolar RMS. The identification of alveolar RMS with t(1;13) translocation might become important in the future, because this type of translocation seems to be related to a better prognosis as compared to tumors with a t(2;13) translocation.","2269":"","2270":"","2271":"The clinico-pathologic characteristics and the histological\/immunohistological differential diagnosis of villous trophoblastic lesions (complete, partial, and invasive hydatiform moles), gestational choriocarcinoma and trophoblastic tumors and pseudotumors of the placental site (placental-site trophoblastic tumor, exaggerated placental site reaction, placental site nodule) are reviewed in context with aspects of cytogenetics, epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis.","2272":"The carcinoma of the endometrium is the most common malignancy seen in the female pelvic genital organs. Important risk factors are age and unopposed estrogen (both endogenous and exogenous). In comparison, the association of antiestrogens (e.g., tamoxifen) and endometrial cancer is rather small, as yet. Fortunately, survival is high because the majority of patients have in common the presence of a low grade, low stage carcinoma of the endometroid type which gives rise to vaginal bleeding and forces the patients to attend the gynecologist. Special screening studies (e.g. vaginal sonography) to evaluate the endometrium are not indicated in the asymptomatic patient without risk factors. Tumor type, grading, and--most importantly--the depth of myoinvasion and the extent of extrauterine disease are the prognostic indicators that allow differential treatment, and help to identify patients at high risk vs. low risk for recurrent disease. Investigations of growth fraction, ploidy, steroid receptors, K-ras or p53 may be a supplement for dissecting special subgroups, but do not influence the clinical regimen, as yet. Most patients with stage I cancer are cured by surgery alone. Patients successfully treated for endometrial cancer should enjoy the benefits of estrogen replacement therapy, since they do not bear a risk of increased recurrence of their disease. Radiation therapy will be given to patients with incomplete resection of pelvic disease and\/or extensive lymphonodal involvement, especially paraaortal lymph node metastasis. As yet, there is no rationale for an adjuvant hormone-(gestagen-) or chemotherapy. An exception, however, is the (mostly palliative) treatment of recurrent disease.","2273":"As to to their frequency and variety, endometrial meta- and hyperplasias are the most impressive examples of the growth and differentiation potential of the Muellerian system and the inductive power of steroid hormones and related inter- and intracellular factors. Characteristic steroid reactions are the glandular hyperplasias, ciliated and squamous cell metaplasias in the case of hyperestrogenism, and the mucinous and clear cell meta- and hyperplasias in the case of gestagen excess. In 1994, the WHO established a new classification of endometrial hyperplasias. This classification takes into account the profound differences in cancer risk, and accordingly demands a clearcut distinction between simple and complex (steroid sensitive, almost always reversible) hyperplasias without atypia, and simple and complex (partial steroid resistant and potential progressive) hyperplasias with atypia. The conclusion drawn from clinical experience is, that the atypical endometrial hyperplasia--and this alone--is the precancerous lesion of the ordinary endometroid carcinoma. In contrast, it is still not clear which biological significance accounts to all the complex squamous, mucinous, clear cell and ciliated cell meta- and hyperplasias. Yet, it is good pathological and clinical practice, to upgrade any metaplastic lesion with nuclear atypia, and to remove the uterus as it is done in almost all atypical endometrial hyperplasias.","2274":"The ovarian steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone exert their effect by interacting with their intracellular receptors, which, after ligand binding translocate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of target genes. The consequence is a change in the transcription rate of the target genes, followed by a change in production of the corresponding proteins. Target genes of the sexual steroid hormones include cytokines and growth factors, among them CSF-1, TGF-beta and LIF. The rhythm and activity of steroidogenesis, receptor modulation and transcription are reflected by cycle-specific proliferation and differentiation processes in the endometrium. Quantitative and\/or qualitative molecular endocrinology is of increasing interest for better definition of morphological changes, although, as yet, the pathological laboratory test is of much less practical consequence than a suspicious vaginal sonography. In spite of the high standard of ultrasound techniques, however, most cases with slightly increased endometrial thickness show histologically benign changes of the endometrium rather than endometrial precancer or cancer. This is especially true for perimenopausal women with no other clinical findings. Yet, the cancer risk is increased in women under tamoxifen therapy. Hence, as a rule, these cases, when endometrial thickness exceeds 5 mm, need a diagnostic biopsy or abrasio.","2275":"The clinical management of cervical carcinomas is solely based upon the FIGO-staging system. Therefore clinical staging is crucial for primary therapy of cervical carcinomas. Accurate morphologic evaluation of the surgical specimens completes the clinical staging and determines postoperative procedures and the individual prognosis. The most important morphologic prognostic factors include stromal invasion, vascular space involvement, tumor volume and surgical margins (pelvic recurrence, metastasic dissemination, survival). The prognostic and therapeutic importance of tumor biological markers is presently controversial. Radical surgical therapy (Wertheim-Meigs surgery) and primary or adjuvant pelvic radiation are currently the basic therapeutic modalities for invasive cervical carcinomas. The role of chemotherapy still needs to be defined. A less radical therapeutic approach is performed for microinvasive cervical carcinomas depending on the extent of stromal invasion, the presence of vascular space involvement and the surgical margins.","2276":"Diagnosis of cervical dysplasia is based on colposcopy, cytology and histology. In case of suspect cytology, the management (controls only, extended diagnosis by histology or therapy without additional histological control) is dependent on colposcopic findings. Biopsy or endocervical curettings are necessary in cases of suspect ectocervical findings or endocervical lesions, respectively. As a rule, HE staining is sufficient for histological diagnosis. Yet, additional prognostic information is obtained by HPV-analysis and DNA-cytometry. Grading of dysplasia should be done according to the most recent WHO\/ISGYP criteria. The exact diagnosis as to the grading and extension of dysplasia is the prerequisite of an effective individually adjusted therapy. For ablative therapy, gynecologists have to focus their attention on modern organ preserving surgery strategies (loop-excision).","2277":"Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case. The positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13%. Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Papsmears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells. The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%. DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled. The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.","2278":"Cervical carcinomas and their precursors (cervical dysplasia, CIN1-3) are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Epidemiological and in vitro-studies have shown that some of the genital HPV types, the high risk-types 16, 18, 31 etc., code for proteins (E6\/E7) which strongly influence the cell cycle and genome stability. Progression from weak to severe dysplasia and to invasive cancer is associated with increasing expression of these viral oncogenes. Which additional cofactors contribute to progression of some dysplasias to carcinomas is still a matter of investigation. Recent results point to genetic predisposition (p53 polymorphism), cellular immune reaction, and cytokine expression. For HPV detection in cervical swabs and biopsies two highly sensitive and reliable systems (PCR, Hybrid Capture system) are available. Although classical histological methods are sufficient for the diagnosis of high-grade lesions and invasive cancer, HPV testing might give valuable diagnostic and prognostic clues especially in cases of unclear cytology (ASCUS) or weak dysplasia.","2279":"Tumor classification, grading and staging of malignant tumors of the cervix and corpus uteri should be done according to the rules of the WHO fascicle of 1994 and the TNM manual of 1997, respectively. With these lines taking into account, the surgical pathology report will include the most important prognostic factors, which in part are also of therapeutic relevance, i.e. localization of the lesion, depth of invasion and distant tumor manifestation. Yet, gross inspection and preparation are the prerequisites of the quality of the histopathological statement. Accurate documentation of tumor extension, depth of invasion into the cervical stroma and\/or the myometrium and distance to the resection lines at the vaginal cuff and the parametrium needs to be given in centimeters, first by eye, than controlled by histopathology. The tumor extension of cervical carcinomas should be given in three dimensions, including the depth of invasion into the cervical wall. It is also mandatory to document the number and size of lymph nodes with metastatic involvement compared to the total number of nodes which are discovered in parametral, pelvioperitoneal and paraaortal sites. Most of what has been outlined for the surgical pathology report of hysterectomy specimens is also pertinent to conisations, by whatever method these are performed (cold knife, laser or loop). For appropriate documentation of the localization of the lesion, horizontal expansion of the dysplastic lesion and recognition of microinvasion it is sufficient to dissect the conisation specimen clockwise and to cut the various paraffin blocks in serial sections.","2280":"Empirical knowledge, daily diagnostic efforts and scientific spirits are the prerequisites of theoretical and practical progress in gynecopathology. The current standards in this field have their root in the continuous interests of gynecologists educated and skilled in pathology. In Germany, however, there is no more the gynecologist, who is in charge for both the clinical and pathological diagnostic business. Also, it is no more a rule for gynecologists to pass through a fellowship in pathology during their specialization. This development leads to more distance between gynecology and pathology, which per se is a potential source of misunderstandings. One of the tasks of this introduction and subsequent articles is to describe controversial areas and to offer ways out of the conflicts. Yet, the master key for avoiding misunderstandings is the close interdisciplinary co-operation in the perioperative management of the patient.","2281":"","2282":"","2283":"","2284":"A precordial tumor of the pericardium was radiologically diagnosed as the cause of an untypical clinical picture of heart disease in a 41-year-old soldier. As the patient had an increased asbestos exposure due to his profession, he was admitted to operation under the tentative diagnosis of a pericardial mesothelioma and the question of an occupational disease (BK 4105). Microscopic and immunohistochemical findings are compatible with the diagnosis of a synovial sarcoma of the pericardium. The present immunohistochemical marker spectrum allowed a reliable differentiation between synovial sarcoma and pericardial mesothelioma, which is more frequent than synovial sarcoma. The epithelioid component was determined using the following antibodies: MNF 116, CK 19, CK 7, EMA and Ber EP-4 were positive while Factor VIII, Calretinin, S100, Vimentin, CEA, CD 31, bcl-2 and HBA-71 were negative. The sarcomatous component was determined with antibodies to Vimentin, bcl-2 and HBA-71 which were positive, and to MNF 116, CK 19, CK 7, Factor VIII, Calretinin, S100, EMA, CEA, Ber EP-4 and CD 31 which were negative. Synovial sarcomas of the pericardium in the lower anterior mediastinum or the myocardium are exceedingly rare. A causal relationship between tumor formation and an increased asbestos exposure--similar to the epidemiologically based experiences with pericardial mesothelioma--is not likely. Primary extrapericardial synovial sarcoma could be excluded.","2285":"Epithelioid angiomyolipoma is a recently recognized tumor entity, of which 9 tumors are documented in the literature. We report a case that occurred in a 19 years old patient. The tumor consisted of epithelioid cells ranging from medium sized and polygonal to giant cells with prominent nucleoli. Remarkably, there were many multinucleated giant cells. Hemorrhage, necrosis, and clusters of foamy macrophages were also present. Obvious elements of typical angiomyolipoma, especially fatty tissue was not found. Flow cytometry revealed diploid tumor cells with a high S-phase fraction of 9.7%. Melanoma-associated antigen HMB-45 and CD 68 was detected in the epithelioid and spindle cells. The multinucleated giant cells stained for desmin and KP1, and to a lesser extent for HMB-45 and vimentin. There was no expression of cytokeratin or epithelial membrane antigen. Epithelioid angiomyolipoma often pose problems in diagnosis, particularly with regard to distinction from renal cell carcinoma. Previous reports in the literature suggest that epithelioid angiomyolipoma may have malignant potential.","2286":"Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations. We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis. There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years. Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation. The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash. He died of sudden cardiac death. The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development. Special features are emphasized. Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature. During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results. Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.","2287":"Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors. The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason. No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.","2288":"Calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves, a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date. Previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction. The relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (St. Jude Medical, Bioimplant) is assessed by Sudan red III staining to show preexisting lipids. All porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees. Five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks. Distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the Sudan red-stained fatty areas. Comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57-66%. Two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and von Kossa's stain, respectively. By light microscopy, the von Kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits. These preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue. Substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification.","2289":"Dermatofibroma is a common benign fibrohistiocytic lesion which presents with a wide variety of clinicopathologic variants. This may cause great difficulties in delineation from a variety of benign and malignant tumours. According to their peculiarities we differentiate: 1. Dermatofibromas with architectural peculiarities like deep penetrating, atrophic, giant, aneurysmal (\"angiomatoid\"), haemangiopericytoma-like, palisading or ossifying variants. 2. Dermatofibromas with cellular\/stromal peculiarities like clear cell, granular cell, myofibroblastic, sclerotic, monster cell, atypical (\"pseudosarcomatous\"), elusive (\"haemosiderotic\"), cholesterotic, and myxoid variants. 3. Dermatofibromas with architectural and cellular\/stromal peculiarities in homogenous arrangement like epithelioid cell, cellular benign variants, with smooth muscle proliferation, basal cell carcinoma-like, pseudolymphomatous, multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma, cellular neurothekeoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour, plexiform xanthoma and plexiform xanthomatous tumour. 4. Complex or composite dermatofibromas with two or more architectural and cellular\/stromal peculiarities in inhomogenous arrangement, e.g. silhouette of an epithelioid cell histiocytoma with plexiform fascicles of cellular neurothekeoma and granular cell features.","2290":"One hundred and three cases of Spitz nevi were reviewed, 36% of these patients were adults. The lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities. In adults, they affect the legs in women, and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma. Clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as Spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults. Spitz nevi were most commonly mistaken clinically for \"common\" melanocytic nevus, hemangioma, verruca, fibrous histiocytoma, molluscum contagiosum, granuloma pyogenicum, keloid, and melanoma. Histologically, there are various expressions of Spitz nevi, but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle- and\/or epithelioid melanocytes. There are only small histopathological differences between Spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood: one important feature rarely seen in Spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the dermo-epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus. Nevus Reed is considered to possibly be a distinctly pigmented variant of Spitz nevus.","2291":"","2292":"Histologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural results of a rhinoscleroma diagnosed bioptically on a 38 aged man are demonstrated. The characteristic light microscopic sign is a plasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate with dense packed foamy transformed macrophages (Mikulicz cells) ultrastructurally containing diplobacilli (Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, gram negative agent of the lesion). The lesion has to be differentiated as of other inflammatory diseases as of plasmocytoma. A local application of acriflavin solution 2% was of therapeutical benefit.","2293":"The authors describe the histopathology of the resting cartilage and the growth plate in a case of diastrophic dysplasia and review the differential diagnosis with pseudo-diastrophic dysplasia and atelosteogenesis type II.","2294":"Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast. Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas. In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcinoma from a different location. Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear. A pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed, considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages. Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma. Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role. The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years. These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule. Estimating the prognosis and therapeutic management in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the breast should follow the same guidelines as for other squamous cell cancers.","2295":"The possible relation of acquired cystic kidney disease to renal cell carcinoma resulted in an interdisciplinary concern about this disease. Kidneys from 125 autopsies of dialysis patients were studied. Twenty-four of the patients had tumors. Beside four renal adenocarcinomas and two urothelial carcinomas, incidental small tumor nodules were described in 15.1%. Men had more nodules than women. Patients with nodules had a higher average cyst count, often with multi-layered epithelium. There was no difference in age or time of dialysis. This suggests a factor which mediates cyst and tumor proliferation, independent from the time of dialysis. With the improvement in imaging techniques, an increasing number of small renal tumors will be found. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the risk of small kidney cell tumors and their association with acquired cystic kidney disease.","2296":"The concept of a thyroid disease register based on a relational database system with a structured query language (SQL) is reported. More than 5000 examination findings of benign and malignant thyroid disorders have been recorded so far, covering the period from 1986 to 1996. For epidemiological studies these population-based thyroid diseases data can be allocated to a digital data map by means of the five-digit German postal code. When evaluating the data with regard to the function of the thyroid gland as an indicator of preceding nuclear power plant disasters and fallout, we found neither indicators of an increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma as an aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster nor the occurrence of clusters. The data were supplemented by the results of a survey among all Schleswig-Holstein pathologists involved in the diagnosis of thyroid diseases. Data on childhood carcinoma of the thyroid were also provided by the Childhood Tumor Register of the Institute of Pathology, University of Kiel, and by the Childhood Cancer Register of the University of Mainz.","2297":"Airborne infections are well known in clinical medicine (transport of bacteria by aerosols). During autopsies floating, respirable kinds of bone dust are produced, depending on the type of saw. Experiments were carried out with oscillating saws (without\/with exhauster) and manual saws (autopsy of cranial cavity). The intention was to characterize and quantify the sawdust produced by the different saws. Furthermore, we wanted to find out whether bacteria are transported by these aerosols. Bone dust was collected with adhesive microscopic slides. Alizarin red was used for solid histochemistry of bone particles. Quantification was carried out by an eyepiece micrometer. Airborne particles and bacteria were identified macroscopically per unit of time. The oscillating saw without exhauster produced sawdust in large quantities. This dust was respirable and had suspension power for hours. There was a remarkable reduction of sawdust by an integrated exhauster. Spreading of particles carrying bacteria\/saccharomycetes was seen over 6-8 m. There is a very low risk of an airborne infection when utilizing a manual saw (production of particles similar to chippings, absence of suspended sawdust). It is necessary to take every precaution against airborne infections by wearing breathing masks and safety goggles when using an oscillating saw.","2298":"Amyloid is a biophysically defined, biochemically non-uniform protein which is deposited in the tissue, forming a cross-beta configuration. In paraffin sections it is demonstrated using Congo red staining according to Puchtler et al. and a polarizing microscope with a tension-free clean optic system that shows a typical apple-green birefringence. The identification of amyloid has to be followed by immunostaining for AA, ATTR, A lambda, A kappa and A beta 2 microglobulin and possibly further types of amyloids for classification purposes. Considering the localization, expansion and type localized and generalized types probably can be differentiated. The latter should be correlated to a basic disease. The treatment of the basic disease is the only chance for reducing or eliminating the amyloid deposits. In this review, the modern morphological methods for demonstration and both immunohistological and clinical classification of amyloid and amyloidoses are presented. Rare types are mentioned in the tables.","2299":"Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e.g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western Europe. The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established. The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC. EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases. The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in vitro. These may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type. Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ. Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of non-keratinising NPCs. By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV displays a geographical variability. It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.","2300":"","2301":"A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma. Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occurring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults. It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheliod or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin. It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies. Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma. This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications. Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.","2302":"Telepathology, defined as the practice of pathology over a distance by viewing images transmitted from a remote site, was previously analyzed mainly with respect to technical equipment and diagnostic accuracy compared with conventional histological diagnosis. In this paper, telepathology is analyzed with regard to economic points of view, demonstrating the background for the cost-saving analysis of telepathology. The acquisition cost and the operating costs of a telepathology system are compared with potential cost-saving and other benefits from telepathology. This analysis may help to decide whether or not telepathology should be established in a hospital.","2303":"In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology. These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures. With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized. Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner. Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (isPCR). An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared. Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue. Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.","2304":"Myositis proliferans is a reactive, intramuscular soft tissue disease characterized by fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation, showing similarities to the phase-like development seen in the general pathology of wound healing and hypertrophic scars. Immunohistochemically, a combined expression of vimentin and alpha-sm actin is seen in the spindle-shaped cell formations. The decisive histological preparations is supported by immunohistochemical techniques, especially in the differentiation from sarcoma. If a definite diagnosis is made, incomplete excision may suffice.","2305":"Nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon. This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia. We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy. Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction. Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.","2306":"A 53-year-old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus. After laser therapy, left lobectomy with sleeve resection was carried out. Complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma. There was no past history of an excision or a fulguration of a cutaneous, mucous membrane, or ocular lesion. Examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor. We conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed. The patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow-up period of 10 months.","2307":"In acquired cystic kidney disease cysts develop in kidneys with impaired excretory function. Bleeding, cyst infection and a possible relation to kidney cell carcinoma resulted in an interdisciplinary concern about this disease. Kidney tissue slides from 125 autopsies of dialysis patients were studied. Of totally 967 cysts, 52% were lined by a cuboidal epithelium, with either clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm; 34% showed a flat epithelium. Multilayered epithelium was present in 8.3% and bleeding stigmata in 5.3%. Cyst counts rose with duration of dialysis, with a higher average cyst count in men. There was no correlation between cysts and (1) age, at the time of death of at the beginning of dialysis, (2) type of renal disease, (3) blood group, (4) body weight, (5) coronary heart disease, and (6) diabetes mellitus. More studies on the development of cysts, parameters of cyst formation and complications are necessary, as they are the basis for the interpretation of new imaging techniques, as well as, for a clinical risk assessment.","2308":"Juvenile pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland represents an extremely rare tumour entity and is comparable to congenital tumours of the salivary glands concerning its embryonal structure. The clinical detection of the tumour in a 7-year-old girl does not exclude that the tumour had developed either earlier or immediately after the birth. The high cellularity and the evidence of primitive epithelial and myoepithelial cellular structures do not justify its classification as a malignant tumour. However the presence of embryonal tissue structures associated with the end of the third month of embryogenesis is characterized by more solid cell formations in partly verticulate arrangement. The absence of further differentiation into lobular structures and differentiated duct or acinic cell formations may be due to cell arrest. Differential diagnosis of juvenile pleomorphic adenoma must distinguished it from other congenital salivary gland tumours (e.g. congenital basal cell adenoma, hybrid basal cell adenoma-adenoid cystic carcinoma, sialoblastoma, salivary gland anlage tumour.","2309":"The presence of specific keratins can be of diagnostic value for studying normal and neoplastic epithelium of the vulva. The aim of the present study was to investigate normal, preneoplastic and neoplastic epithelium of the vulva. Keratins 5, 6 and 18, identified by a polyspecific anti-human CK antibody (clone LP 34, DAKO), and the keratin subtypes 7, 10, 14, 18, 19 and 20 of normal, dysplastic and malignant vulval epithelium (paraffin-embedded sections) were detected by immunohistochemical APAAP staining. Keratins 5, 6, and 18 (clone LP 34) and keratin subtype 10 are expressed in the upper third of the normal vulval epithelium. In mild and moderate intraepithelial neoplasia only a few cells express these keratins. In patients with severe intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN III) the expression of these keratins seems to be associated with recurrence of the disease. In biopsy specimens of patients without recurrence we find positive results for keratins 5, 6 and 18 (clone LP 34) and keratin 10. If patients have a recurrence of the disease, expression of these keratins is only diffuse or is absent. The expression of these keratin subtypes in vulval carcinomas is mostly seen in differentiated cells. There was no association between recurrence and keratin pattern. We have not found any other expression of the tested keratin subtypes in VIN and in vulval carcinoma.","2310":"During the last few years, the molecular basis of several cancer predisposition syndromes has been discovered which offers new tools for cancer prevention and early detection. This will be demonstrated in one of the most frequent hereditary cancer syndromes, namely the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) which accounts for about 5% to 8% of CRC. Thereby, families with exclusively CRC (Lynch type I syndrome) and those with extracolonic cancers especially of endometrium, stomach, small bowel and upper urinary tract (Lynch type II syndrome) can be discriminated. At the molecular level, HNPCC is caused by germline mutations in one of the mismatch repair genes (hMSH2, hMLH1, hMSH6, hPMS2). Thus, nucleotide mispairings occurring particularly within simple repetitive genomic sequences (microsatellites) during replication are no longer be repaired properly and can be demonstrated by PCR as so-called microsatellite instability (MSI). Since more than 90% of HNPCC associated and only about 15% of sporadic CRC show MSI, this test is a useful tool for HNPCC screening. In case of a negative result HNPCC is highly unlikely. In positive cases (with &gt; or = 2 out of 5 unstable defined microsatellite markers) the definite molecular diagnosis can only be obtained by sequencing the mismatch repair genes from the patient's blood or normal DNA. As immunohistochemistry reveals loss of hMSH2 or hMLH1 expression in most MSI positive CRC, these data provide useful information for the sequencing strategy. Molecular tumor screening by MSI test and immunohistochemistry is recommended in patients i.) with a positive family history (acc. to the Amsterdam criteria), ii.) suffering from multiple HNPCC related carcinomas, iii.) with HNPCC related cancer before 45 ys of age, and iv.) with right-sided CRC exhibiting medullary, signet-ring or mucinous differentiation. Finally, these tests as well as genetic counseling and treatment of the patient need to be done by an interdisciplinary approach. Thereby, the pathologist can substantially contribute to identify HNPCC related carcinomas either by clinical or morphological criteria and to initiate the molecular screening test.","2311":"The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis). This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced). An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters. This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste. Anne-Mayo System, SAMS). Our results indicate that a similar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas. Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only \"low-grade\" and \"high grade\" cases was prognostically relevant. For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the \"high\" malignancy grade.","2312":"","2313":"About 10% of all nephroblastomas (Wilms' tumor) present as part of malformation syndromes. The Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) comprises pseudohermaphroditism, glomerulopathy and, early, often bilateral Wilms' tumors. A nephrectomy was performed in a 4-month-old girl because of a Wilms' tumor. Two months later, low serum albumin levels and proteinuria had developed. A biopsy from the remaining kidney showed a glomerulopathy which could also be seen in the nephrectomy specimen. The morphology was highly characteristic: the innermost layer of the kidney cortex exhibited augmentation of the mesangial matrix only; the intermediate layer showed severe sclerosis of glomeruli with deposition of fibrillary material; and the subcapsular layer revealed very small glomeruli and atrophic tubuli. Fifteen months later, peritoneal dialysis was necessary and due to the high risk of tumor development in the remaining kidney, a nephrectomy was performed. Molecular analysis revealed a point mutation within exon 9 of the WT1 gene (394 ARG--&gt;TRP), which was homozygous in the tumor and heterozygous within renal parenchyma. The DDS is caused by a mutation in the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 which occurs during oogenesis or spermiogenesis. The WT1 gene is highly expressed during the development of the genitalia and the kidney; damage in one allele only causes the malformation syndrome. Loss of the second allele of the WT1 gene constitutes the second step of tumorigenesis. The appearance of Wilms' tumors derived from cells homozygous for the mutation reveals the function of the WT1 gene as a tumor suppressor gene.","2314":"We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures. Histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma. This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults. There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently. The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open. The decision depends on the given case. Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue. The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.","2315":"The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes. In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia. Viral infections and\/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult gaint cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer. In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses. Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection. These both indicate an infectious cause. However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees. Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically. In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient. This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.","2316":"Because of the rising importance of talcum pleurodesis in the therapeutic management of malignant and benign pleural effusions in Germany, pleural samples after talcum pleurodesis were compared to microscopic, immunohistochemical, and scanning electron microscopy findings after Tetracyclin and Novantron pleurodesis in 24 patients up to 18 months after intrapleural therapy. The histomorphological findings after talcum pleurodesis show an early phase of up to 4 weeks, characterized by the presence of talcum-containing granulation tissue with giant-cell foreign-body reaction, and a subsequent late phase with organization of the granulation tissue and connective tissue formation and obliteration of the pleura sheets. The resulting characteristic linear talcum zone in the pleural connective tissue is missing in cases with tumorous infiltration of the pleura. Continuous fibroblast activation, e.g., by macrophage or foreign-body giant-cell-released mediators, seems to be the decisive factor in the fibrosing process. No therapy-related tumor growth alterations could be demonstrated.","2317":null,"2318":"Primary squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the salivary glands are localized predominantly in the major salivary glands and must be distinguished from metastases of extraglandular SCC of the skin, especially the head and neck area. Squamous cell metaplasia in non-tumourous diseases of the salivary gland (e.g. necrotizing sialometaplasia) as well as in benign or malignant salivary gland tumours (e.g. metaplastic Warthin tumour) can simulate SCC. Other differential diagnostic problems are the structural variants of SCC which develop predominantly in the minor salivary glands, but not in the major salivary glands. Special types include the very rare adenoid SCC with pseudoglandular structures as the result of acantholysis, the biphasic adenosquamous carcinoma with differentiation as SCC and adenocarcinoma, the biphasic basaloid squamous carcinoma with a structure as SCC and solid basaloid carcinoma (analogous to the solid type of adenoid-cystic carcinoma) and the poorly differentiated mucoepidermoid carcinoma (grade III) with biphasic structure of undifferentiated epidermoid and intermediate cells as well as inclusion of small groups of mucous-producing goblet cells. The differential diagnostic criteria are analysed concerning prognosis and treatment.","2319":"In a retrospective study of a 12-year period (1981-1992) liver histology was analyzed in 227 autopsied patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Normal histology could only be documented in 29 patients (13%). In the majority of cases (56%) uncharacteristic changes were seen such as steatosis (34%), hemosiderosis (10%) or non-specific reactive hepatitis (7%). The finding of hepatic peliosis obtained in 4 patients was not associated with inflammatory liver changes, especially infections from Rochalimaea. Within a wide range of opportunistic infections recorded in 50 patients (22%), hepatitis caused by Cytomegalovirus (8%), Toxoplasma gondii (5%), Leishmania donovani (1%), Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis carinii (each 0.5%) was diagnosed. Among 16 cases (7%) of mycobacterial liver infections typical mycobacteria were found in two patients and atypical mycobacteria in 14 patients, respectively. In 23 patients (10%) chronic viral hepatitis, caused by HBV (7%) or HCV infections (3%), respectively, was observed. Hepatitis was typed as mild only in each 5 patients with HBV or HCV infection, whereas the remaining cases showed a transition towards cirrhosis. Two patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The remaining 32 malignant liver tumors represented secondary neoplasms, including 13 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.","2320":"When studying inflammation and wound healing, peculiar fibroblasts with ultrastructural similarities to smooth muscle cells were described by a group of pathologists associated with Guido Majno (GM) and Giulio Gabbiani (GG), subsequently called myofibroblasts. Similar cells were also found later in human granulation tissue, palmar fibromatosis and in stromal reactions with invasive cancers. Their identification was facilitated by immunohistochemical methods. Some neoplastic cells, for instance in MFH, also revealed characteristics compatible with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are conceived of as modulated fibroblasts. Cytokines may serve as mediators for activation and contractile modification of fibroblasts. In this context monitoring of a tumor-like overproduction of myofibroblasts or an underproduction with non-union of wounds might also be feasible. Moreover, better understanding of the role of myofibroblasts concerning the transition from in situ carcinomas into invasive growth may have therapeutic perspectives. Myofibroblasts apparently not only show a temporary existence in disease, but also can be found under normal conditions in several regions, such as the skin, periodontal ligaments, or pulmonary septa.","2321":"This review summarizes myofibroblastic tumours that have been characterized in the last years. These lesions include: fibromatoses in adults and infants (infantile digital fibromatosis and infantile myofibromatosis); myofibroma of adults, an almost exclusively solitary lesion in the skin which is characterized morphologically as a biphasic lesion composed of spindle-shaped eosinophilic tumour cells and more primitive mesenchymal tumour cells associated with a haemangiopericytoma-like vasculature; dermatomyofibroma (plaque-like dermal fibromatosis), a band-like myofibroblastic proliferation in young female patients, which is mainly located in the periaxillar region and in which distinction from more aggressive, plaque-like variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is mandatory; myofibroblastoma of the breast, a well-circumscribed lesion composed of spindle shaped, desmin-positive tumour cells, which is seen mainly in elderly male patients and has to be distinguished from other spindle cell lesions of the breast; angiomyofibroblastoma, a well-circumscribed myofibroblastic neoplasm of the vulva and vagina composed of avoid to round myoid tumour cells with scattered multinucleated cells, which forms a continuous morphological spectrum with the clinically more aggressive angiomyxoma in this location; intranodal myofibroblastoma, a distinctive proliferation of myofibroblastic cells associated with so-called amianthoid fibres, which is seen most commonly in inguinal lymph nodes; myofibroblastoma\/myofibroblastic tumour of soft tissues, a variably well-circumscribed myofibroblastic lesion which lacks atypia and is composed of actin and\/or desmin positive tumour cells, and poorly delineated sarcomas with myofibroblastic differentiation (myofibrosarcoma).","2322":"","2323":"The surgical pathology of biopsies or electroresection specimens taken from clinically suspicious or overt tumors in the urinary bladder encompasses the evaluation of a few parameters. This should allow the segregation of bladder tumor patients into subgroups with distinct clinical features and biological behavior, thus providing a rationale for choosing the best available therapy. In essence, the pathologist's role entails a careful morphologic assessment of the primary tumor, including evaluation of the histologic type, the growth pattern, the tumor grade, the tumor stage, and finally the presence and type of primary or tumor-associated flat intraurothelial lesions. Whereas the growth pattern of a lesion can be readily recognized, the correct grading and staging of papillary tumors are often more dependent on the complexity of the individual case and the experience of the pathologist due to the inherent subjectivity of the field and a lack of standardized criteria. These problems of intra- and interobserver variability are intimately coupled with the characteristics of the material, that is, bad orientation and tangential sectioning, thermal injury, crush and fixation artifacts, and limitations of the size of the samples. The correct evaluation and interpretation of flat intrauorothelial lesions suffer from similar difficulties and are further complicated by a confusing categorization and terminology. Although new modalities and molecular approaches have been introduced in recent years in an effort to overcome some of these obstacles, morphology still remains the most effective means to assess the biological behavior and prognosis of urothelial bladder cancer. The present article therefore addresses some of the diagnostically and clinically most relevant controversies and aims to give some useful hints for the evaluation of the above-mentioned morphological parameters. In addition, it adds some remarks on the morphological basis and diagnostic validity of urinary cytology in primary diagnosis and, more importantly, monitoring of bladder cancer patients.","2324":"Spindle cell lesions of the prostate and surrounding tissues include mesenchymal and epithelial tumors and tumorlike lesions, such as postoperative spindle cell nodules (PSN) and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors (PFMT). PSN and PFMT are possibly related fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferations respectively. However, they may be misinterpreted as sarcomas. PSN typically are detected incidentally several weeks or months after urological procedures such as cystoscopy. PFMT only rarely reveals a urological history, however, reaching back for several years; here, more often there is a clinical presentation with dysuria and\/or hematuria. Important for the differential diagnosis of PSN and PFMT or sarcomas is not only a histological examination, including immunohistochemistry, but also a close clinicopathological correlation. Nevertheless, in some cases it may be impossible to reach a final diagnosis.","2325":"Development and progression of tumors is driven by a malfunction of specific genes. Although prostate cancer is one of the most frequent tumors, little is known about the genes involved. Cytogenetic and molecular examinations have shown that chromosomal deletions most frequently involve 7q, 8p, 10q, 13q, 16q, 17p and the Y chromosome. These loci may carry tumor suppressor genes with relevance for prostate cancer. DNA sequence copy number gains were most frequently observed at chromosomes 7, 8q, and 11q. These regions may carry currently unknown oncogenes. There is increasing evidence for a clinical relevance of genetic alterations. Polysomies of several chromosomes were shown to be associated with poor prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Androgen receptor amplification can be found in hormone-refractory carcinomas which may respond to total androgen blockage. For the future it is hoped that the identification of the genes involved in prostate cancer and the determination of their function could allow for significant improvements of treatment strategies for prostate cancer patients.","2326":"Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in males in Western countries. In the United States 317,000 men were newly diagnosed with this disease in 1996. Screening efforts will identify increasing numbers of men who will be scheduled for prostate biopsy. Since the progression of prostate cancer varies widely from rapid tumor growth with early distant metastases to slow growth with good prognosis, it is of utmost importance that prognostic parameters be identified which allow the course of the disease to be predicted. Thus, the correct pathohistological staging, the evaluation of different grading systems, and the biological impact of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy requires collaboration between urologists and pathologists.","2327":"Transrectal fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non-palpable nodules, yielding high sensitivity (ca. 95%) and a low complication rate (&lt; 1%). Its specificity amounts to &gt; 97%. The scarcity of urologists trained in the FNAB method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far. Besides various forms of prostatitis, five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated. While PIN I cannot be cytologically identified, PIN II\/III lesions may lead to false-positive diagnoses. Cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic counterpart. Preoperative, radiologically controlled FNAB of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca.86% and specificity of 100%. It thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven. Diagnostic DNA cytometry is able to identify those prostatic cancer patients who do not reveal significantly increased risk of tumor progression or decreased survival probability, even without therapy (constantly and representatively diploid and tetraploid patterns). Patients with DNA tetraplid histograms may show deteriation of prognosis under hormonal therapy. DNA-aneuploid prostatic cancers should not be subjected to a \"wait and see\" strategy; they do not respond to hormonal therapy.","2328":"The histological classification or typing of prostate carcinoma combined with histological grading according to Gleason or WHO with nucleolar subgrading are the most important prognostic factors in carcinoma of the prostate. Prostatic cancer is the most common malignancy in adult males and is the second-most-common cause of cancer death in the USA. The histological Gleason grade may be reduced if only a small amount of tumor tissue is present in the core needle biopsy, in contrast to the combined histological and cytological grading according to WHO with nucleolar subgrading. When there is sufficient carcinomatous tissue in the core needle biopsy, there is no difference from that in radical prostatectomy tissue, because most cases of prostatic carcinoma are highly malignant. DNA cytometry, immunohistochemical analysis with Ki67\/Mib1 or molecular pathological studies with the tumor suppressor gene p53 or apoptosis suppressing oncoprotein bcl2 and the density of blood capillaries may be helpful as additional prognostic factors, but only together with the results of the primary histological section. For comparison of grading results with the international literature both grading systems should be used according to Gleason and WHO with nucleolar subgrading.","2329":"Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is considered the most likely precursor of clinically significant prostate cancer. Biopsy remains the only definitive method for detecting these premalignant lesions. In this article we review the diagnostic criteria of HGPIN and discuss histological features that allow their distinction from other benign and malignant lesions. PIN is recognised at low power magnification as a thickened, basophilic and hyperchromatic epithelium in pre-existing acinar duct structures. This important histological feature is due to nuclear crowding and stratification. Distinction between HGPIN and low grade PIN (LGPIN), a lesion with little clinical significance, is made mainly on the presence or absence of prominent nucleoli. HGPIN lesions always retain an intact or fragmented basal cell layer. The different growth patterns of HGPIN (tufting, micropapillary, cribriform and flat) have no clinical significance but should be considered in the differential diagnosis together with normal structures, and both benign and malignant lesions. HGPIN has a high predictive value as a marker for prostate cancer but should not influence therapeutic decisions. Its identification in biopsy specimens warrants close surveillance with repeated biopsy.","2330":"The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer relies on a combination of structural and cytological findings. Structural features are assessed at low power magnification. Malignant glands are recognised by their abnormal size, shape and location in relation to the surrounding benign glandular structures. The presence of pathological intraluminal secretions (pink amorphous secretions, crystalloids, blue-tinged mucinous secretions) is always suspicious, but not diagnostic for prostate cancer. Cytological criteria including nuclear and nucleolar enlargement, hyperchromasia and cytoplasmic changes have to be evaluated in comparison with the cytological features of surrounding benign glands. The presence of prominent nucleoli is neither diagnostic for malignancy nor represents an absolute requirement for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The basal cell layer is absent in invasive adenocarcinoma, an important feature that has to be evaluated with care since benign glands may also lack detectable basal cells. The immunohistochemical demonstration of basal cells with high molecular weight cytokeratins excludes invasive cancer. This article reviews the histological criteria for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, including variants of common adenocarcinoma and therapy-induced changes.","2331":"Enlargement of the prostate is an age-related, physiological process that is unique in human tissue. The prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men. Despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality, the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer remains poorly understood. This reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic, cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes. The present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate. There is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the most likely precursor of clinically important cancer of the peripheral zone. Severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium. These premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors, oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability. During the process of stromal invasion the transformed cells lose their basal cell phenotype and produce basement membrane-like matrices. Common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen-responsive even in hormone-independent disease. The frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells. The endocrine phenotype derives from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate (amphicrine) cell types. Neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen-insensitive cell population in prostate cancer.","2332":"The scope of the present review is to define diagnostic criteria of benign prostatic lesions causing diagnostic difficulty in surgical pathology. The prostate harbors a variety of small acinar lesions that may mimic prostate cancer in biopsy specimens. Generally, the most important diagnostic clues are obtained on low-power magnification by assessing architectural features. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is a small acinar proliferation closely related to hyperplastic glands. Diagnostic features of postatrophic hyperplasia include a lobular small acinar proliferation associated with atrophic and dilated acini. Basal cell hyperplasia and sclerosing adenosis show characteristic stromal changes that are uncommon in prostate cancer. Additional cytological features and intraluminal secretions are also important in the diagnostic evaluation of small acinar lesions in biopsy specimens. Negative immunohistochemical results obtained with basal-cell-specific cytokeratins should be evaluated in context with other diagnostic criteria. The unequivocal demonstration of basal cells in small acinar lesions excludes invasive cancer. Other rare small acinar lesions must be recognized when assessing biopsy specimens, including verumontanum-mucosa hyperplasia, Cowper's glands and mesonephroid hyperplasia. The various small acinar lesions discussed in the present review have no clinical significance, except atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), which may be a precursor of small acinar cancer of the transition zone. The biological and clinical significance of AAH, however, remains to be established.","2333":"We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult. A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man. The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital. Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with 013, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30\/32MIC2. Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin. The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue. The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.","2334":"We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient. The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin. HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma. Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.","2335":"Leiomyosarcomas of the spermatic cord are very rare tumours, which, in contrast to the rhabdomyosarcoms of childhood, occur almost exclusively in adults. We report the case of a 51-year-old male patient with a metastasizing, pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma of the spermatic cord. The tumour showed paraneoplastic secretion of beta-chain human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), as was demonstrated by the elevated levels of beta-hCG in serum samples and by immunohistochemistry. Histologically, the tumour was a high-grade leiomyosarcoma which showed an aggressive course with pulmonary metastases appearing 4 months after primary surgery. A concomitant rise in the serum levels of beta-hCG was also noted at this time. A wide spectrum of tumours with a choriocarcinomatous component or paraneoplastic production of beta-hCG has been described, the vast majority being carcinomas. Only two leiomyosarcomas producing beta-hCG have so far been reported. The paraneoplastic production of beta-hCG should prevent confusion with germ-cell tumours, especially teratomas.","2336":"A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome. Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glomerulopathy on light and electron microscopy. Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g. amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded. Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.","2337":"The differential diagnosis of bullous and cystiform lung alterations comprises a relatively calculable number of various diseases, in which the most important are rare cystic tumors and congenial malformations, such as adenomatoid cystic malformation. We report on a rare clinical picture. In this case, the clinical diagnosis of localized unilateral emphysema caused by local displacement and with subsequent complications had led to \"bullectomies\" and pneumonectomy. Macroscopically, spongiform solid areas in association with areas of physaliform transformation were seen, corresponding histomorphologically to villous, placentalike formations. The \"villous stroma\" revealed focally regressive alterations, fatty islets and leiomyomatous areas. So far, the pathogenesis of this lesion, described as \"placentoid malformation\" due to its pathognomonic histological appearance, remains unclear. In contradiction to the much discussed hypothesis that this lesion may develop from pre-existing lung emphysema, our results suggest that this may be an independent lesion, possibly congenital hamartous malformation with self-developing progression. The clinically predominant emphysematic alterations are considered to be caused by a valve mechanism due to unphysiological traction forces, the lymphatic pathways regularly found in the border areas towards the original lung tissue, possibly playing an important etiological part.","2338":"Chronic rejection is a major problem in contemporary kidney transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether renal cells are repopulated by extra-renal cells over time or whether the graft remains permanently allogenic. We studied nine explanted allografted kidneys of sex-mismatched donors by means of non-isotopic in situ hybridization (NISH). We used biotinylated centromer-specific DNA probes of the human chromosomes Y and X. In a further step, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, alpha-actin, factor Vill and UEA were used to analyse the various infiltrating cell types and the cells involved in allograft arteriopathy. In several cases NISH and immunohistochemistry were combined to facilitate the typing of cells. Our study showed that up to several years after transplantation the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained donor origin. The only cells of recipient origin were the inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages and T lymphocytes.","2339":"Chromosomal aberrations are an important cause of spontaneous abortions. In order to detect numerical aberrations, paraffin-embedded tissue from 26 abortions with known conventional cytogenetic findings (CCG; 25 numerical aberrations and one partial trisomy 7p) was analyzed by means of interphase cytogenetics (ICG) using centromer-specific DNA probes for chromosomes #X, #Y, #10, #18, and #13\/#21. Limit-values for the diagnosis of aneusomy in tissue sections were established by classifying the distribution of hybridization signals by CCG data (for gain &gt; or = 15% of nuclei with +1 signal; for deletion &gt; 40% of nuclei with -1 signal). Signal distribution in tissue sections and nuclear suspensions from paraffin blocks analyzed in parallel showed statistically a highly significant correlation (P &lt; 0.0001). ICG and CCG diagnoses corresponded in 18 of 20 cases suitable for evaluation (90%; no false-positive result). No correlation between cytogenetic and histologic findings could be found. ICG proved to be a reliable tool for the detection of numerical chromosomal aberrations in paraffin-embedded tissue of abortions (sections and nuclear suspensions). This, data for genetic counselling of the parents can be provided. The limit values for diagnosis of aneusomy could also be important for the application of ICG in tumor cytogenetics.","2340":"Localized depositions of amyloid in the seminal vesicles may occur in elderly men. Earlier immunohistochemical studies have failed to identify immunoreactivity of known amyloid material. In this autopsy study, all seminal vesicles of males older than 50 years were histologically examined to determine incidence and phenotype of seminal vesicle amyloidosis. Seven out of 50 patients (14%) showed depositions of amyloid in the seminal vesicles. These amyloid depositions as well as one additional case were characterized histochemically, immunohistochemically and electronmicroscopically. All but two of these patients (75%) showed simultaneously amyloid depositions in the heart. Lactoferrin immunoreactivity was found in 6 patients (75%). Lactoferrin is an iron-binding, bacteriostatic glycoprotein, which is produced in the seminal vesicles. Four patients with lactoferrin positive amyloid in seminal vesicle showed different amyloid depositions in the heart (immunoglobulin light chain amyloid AL-lambda). Two cases (25%) showed the same amyloid type in heart and seminal vesicles (prealbumin-transthyretin type amyloid). Our study shows that most amyloidoses of the seminal vesicles are organ-limited depositions of lactoferrin. These forms of localized amyloidosis have to be separated from senile systemic amyloidosis with seminal vesicle involvement.","2341":"The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors. Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed. It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver. The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however. In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia. Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist. Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs. The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.","2342":"The phenotypic variability of epithelial ovarian neoplasms correlates with a diversity of changes on the molecular level. Invasive serous and undifferentiated ovarian carcinomas are characterized by p53 mutations, extensive loss of genetic material of chromosome 17 and complex changes on many other chromosomes. These alterations are seen only in a minority of mucinous and endometrioid carcinomas, mainly in advanced stages. Overexpression of bcl-2 is seen most frequently in endometrioid carcinomas (ca. 90% of cases), which in addition show microsatellite instability in around a third of cases, as has been described in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. KRAS mutations are characteristic for mucinous LMP tumors (borderline tumors) and mucinous carcinomas (40-50% of cases). Furthermore, KRAS mutations have been described in around a third of serous LMP tumors, which in addition show microsatellite instability in up to 40% of cases. Serous LMP tumors never harbour complex chromosomal aberrations.","2343":"The destruction of the epithelial basement membrane is widely regarded as a clear criterion for invasive malignant tumor growth. Since, however, defects in the basement membrane may also occur in non-invasive conditions, such as inflammatory and proliferative lesions, and since it has been shown that particularly in highly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas a continuous basement membrane is mimicked by the presence of isolated components, this criterion seems to be of minor value for the diagnosis of malignancy. Despite these drawbacks, the immunolocalization of basement membrane material may still be of differential diagnostic significance in certain situations. This holds particularly true for invasive (ductal) breast carcinomas, which usually completely lack a basement membrane. Accordingly, sclerosing adenosis can be distinguished from invasive carcinoma, as a distinction can be made between neoplastic (malignant) tubular formations and reactive lesions.","2344":null,"2345":"","2346":"We report on a 69-year old male patient who presented with vague depressive symptoms and loss of weight accompanied by lack of appetite, ageusia and anosmia. The patient died of bronchial pneumonia, and neuropathological examination revealed a so-called limbic encephalitis. The paraneoplastic origin of this case was later confirmed by discovery of a clinically inapparent, indolently growing small cell lung cancer. This case illustrates the difficult clinical diagnosis of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and the need for a close cooperation of pathologists and neuropathologists in the clarification of such cases.","2347":"A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented. The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cat-hepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-anti-chymotrypsin) as well as CD 8. This marker profile suggests that the presented angio-sarcoma originates from sinus cells with histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.","2348":"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), arising in combination with a sacral chordoma in a 70-year-old men, is described. Intermediate spindle-shaped cells demonstrating keratin positivity, showed a gradual transition between the areas of conventional chordoma, and the spindle cell areas, lending credence to the theory of a multipotential neoplasm. We chose the descriptive term \"chordoma with malignant spindle cell component\" in the sense that high malignant sarcomatous components exists in conjunction with chordomas in the primary tumor and the local recurrence. A review of literature is undertaken chronicling the documented associations of chordoma and sarcoma, followed by a discussion of the various causes proposed to explain this phenomenon.","2349":"We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman. There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg. Histologically, primary lesion, local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion (soft tissue metastasis?) showed identical features. Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted. The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.","2350":"When there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged, DNA analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient. The use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded DNA in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples.","2351":"TMLR (Transmyocardial laser revascularization) is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in Europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber. Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels? We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR. Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope. Laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 microns thick. Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks. Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients. These channels communicate with intramural vessels, but in no instance with chamber lumen. Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood. Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium. However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the decreased. If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptom free after TMLR remains open.","2352":"Tumour-like lesions of the salivary glands are diseases which, in accordance with the new WHO classification of salivary gland tumours, can simulate a true tumour by swelling or induration of the salivary gland tissue. An additional rare entity, only recently not described in the new WHO classification, is \"sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy\" (s.p.s.) which, especially in younger patients, results in nodular, incompletely encapsulated, tumour-like masses mainly of the parotid gland. Histologically, it is comparable to fibrocystic mastopathy and is characterized by distinct hyalinized, centrally accentuated sclerosing collageneous tissue with inclusion of cystically ectatic ducts and focal epithelial hyperplasia. In the hyperplastic ducts, trans-luminal bridges and cribriform patterns can develop, sometimes also apocrine secretion and eosinophilic globules. The s.p.s. must be distinguished mainly from cystadenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and also from dysgenetic cystic parotid gland. Based on four of our own observations the differential diagnosis is analysed.","2353":"Malignant transformation of pre-existing Warthin tumours of the parotid gland in carcinomas is very rare compared with the development of carcinomas in pre-existing pleomorphic adenomas. Five cases examined in the Salivary Gland Register of Hamburg 1965-1996 were classified in 2 cases as mucoepidermoid carcinoma and in each of one case as oncocytic carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and acinic cell carcinoma. In the pathogenesis the benign oncocytic epithelial formations at the surface of the cystic spaces are restricted by malignant neoplastic epithelial cells in the course of which transitions of squamous cell metaplasia or goblet cell metaplasia can be observed. In the further course an infiltrating spread of the carcinoma takes place into the lymphoid stromal component of the Warthin tumour, sometimes also an infiltration of the surrounding tissue und rarely to cervical lymph node metastases. The own findings are analysed concerning the classification of the carcinomas and the differential diagnosis under consideration of the until now reported cases of the literature.","2354":"Meningiomas account for the most frequent primary intracranial neoplasms in adults. In 1993, the so-called atypical meningioma has additionally been introduced in the revised edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System and should characterize meningiomas with an increased propensity to recur. Since the given qualitative histological criteria apply both to the \"atypical\" and anaplastic meningioma, mere histological grading appears somewhat critical. Therefore, additional parameters were tested for their contribution to meningioma grading: First of all, we succeeded in defining 3 meningioma \"grades\" by calculating corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the morphometrically assessed Ki-67 indices of 160 meningiomas in total, the validity of which was proved by comparison with the \"recurrence\"-free intervals. Histologically, atypical meningiomas were distinguished by a \"syncytial\", poorly structured growth pattern and macronucleoli. Only occasionally, nuclear pleomorphism, necroses and mitotic figures were found. Cytogenetics revealed, in 50% of the \"atypical\" and anaplastic meningiomas, partial loss of the short arm of one chromosome 1 (1p-). Histochemically, we could demonstrate, that the tissue non-specific type of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), which is coded on chromosome 1p, is a convenient recurrence- and progression-associated marker enzyme for meningiomas with 1p-loss (loss of enzyme activity in 30\/39 of intermediate and 8\/8 anaplastic meningiomas). We favor to address the WHO \"atypical\" meningioma as meningioma of the intermediate type, since the attribute \"atypical\" in the context of histological diagnoses is highly susceptible to misinterpretations.","2355":"","2356":"We report a rare case of psammocarcinoma which presented as a mass in the lower abdomen of an otherwise asymptomatic woman. Ultrasonographically, the tumor showed extensive calcification and was suspected to be a myoma. DNA image cytometry and assessment of proliferative activity were performed and showed an euploid, low proliferating tumor cell population. This underlines the low malignancy of this type of carcinoma, which is comparable to that of serous borderline lesions of the ovary and explains the benign clinical course.","2357":"","2358":"We report on two patients, 74 and 73 years old, each of whom had had biopsy of the bronchial mucosa elsewhere. Histologically, normal mucosa and mild bronchitis was seen, respectively. In both patients a second biopsy specimen from the same site was taken, 4 and 7 days after the first biopsy. Now the diagnosis was carcinoma in situ (not excluding early squamous carcinoma) and squamous carcinoma, respectively. One of the patients came to our lung clinic for operation on the basis of the mentioned diagnosis. A third biopsy was performed for control purposes. It revealed just a perforation of a lymph node in the bronchial wall and some epithelioid granulomas without evidence of acid-fast bacilli. There was no evidence of malignancy in this specimen. Because of the discrepancy, the pathologist at the first institution was asked to send us the previous slides. On review of these slides, the described findings were seen, but they were interpreted as regenerative-atypical. In this way, an unnecessary surgical intervention was avoided. After a follow-up of 3 1\/2 years the patient is healthy. In the other patient, because of the diagnosis of squamous carcinoma a lobectomy was undertaken by a surgeon elsewhere. The pathologist could not find any carcinoma in the surgical specimen. The biopsy material was reviewed in our department, the findings being interpreted as atypical, originating in reparative changes. Like the postoperative pathologist, we did not find any carcinoma in the surgical specimen. In both cases, therefore, regenerative-atypical changes after re-biopsy were first misinterpreted as a malignant process.","2359":"We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man. These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasionally by incontinence. Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation. Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated. Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP. Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature. Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.","2360":"Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery. Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected. Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.","2361":"The case presents a 61 year old woman which came into the hospital with left heart failure. After an unsuccessful trial to treat the heart failure in an habitual method the echocardiographic showed a mass lesion which had filled out mostly of the left atrium. Histological features demonstrated a leiomyosarcoma with an origin from the wall of the left atrium. Immunohistochemical preparations revealed a positivity for actin, desmin and vimentin. Despite an operative resection and an attach of polychemotherapy it developed a local relapse and multiple lymph node metastases. Within the scope of this case report apart from an detailed bibliography it ought to be discussed the origin of the tumor into the atrium and the differential diagnosis from other sarcoma.","2362":"We report on a 36-year old male patient with clinically prolonged intermittent claudication of the right leg. An operative specimen measuring 8.0 cm of the A. poplitea was sent for examination, which was sheathed by an aneurysmal cyst having a maximal diameter of 1.5 cm. Examination under the light microscope showed an incomplete septated ganglion-like cystic formation with flat connective tissue-like cells or even larger histiocytoid cell elements as inner lining. Immunohistochemically, the cells on the inner lining of the cyst showed to be strongly positive to macrophage marker PG-M1, KP1 and Ki-Mp1. The endothelium of the vessels of the wall of the cyst showed a marked expression of cytokeratin 18. Immunohistochemically as well as in conventional histology, there are general parallels between cysts in cystic adventitial degeneration, ganglia and normal synovia as the two last mentioned tissues also show an expression of cytokeratin 18 at the endothelia of smaller vessels as well as an expression of macrophage-associated antigens on cells of the inner lining. Aetiopathologically, the cysts developing in the course of the disease are rather adventitial ganglia.","2363":"In this article we report on a 43-year-old man, who had been treated with two cortisone injections containing soja bean oil for epicondylitis humeri radialis. Four weeks after the second injection necrotized fat which had been extracted surgically was sent to us for histological examination. We could show a calcifying collagen fibre necrosis being cleared by a granulomatous reaction and resorbed by granulation tissue. The calcifying necrosis of collagen fibres might have been induced by soja bean oil which were used as carrier of the drug.","2364":"Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation. Characteristic of this syndrome, there occurred soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis. The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits. These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue. Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved. Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.","2365":null,"2366":"Although estimation of mitotic activity is generally a recognized clinical practice in the diagnosis and grading of tumors, there are several methodologic aspects that merit special consideration. Our results, in relation to those of others, lead to the following conclusions: 1. The values attained by calculating the mitotic activity of tumor cells in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue are lower than those obtained in vivo. The results cannot always be interpreted clinically due to the complexity of some of the factors associated with it which require special attention. That the method still has clinical relevance and value in spite of the associated problems may be due to the fact that tumor tissues generally undergo long periods of hypoxia before being fixed for histomorphological analyses--a condition which by itself is a decisive factor in the reduction of mitotic activity--so that additional changes in some individual factors from case to case do not make much difference to the estimated or calculated value. 2. Mitotic activity should be calculated in areas of tumor sections where there are numerous mitotic tumor cells. Additionally, only cells with nuclei showing lysed nuclear membranes and identifiable single chromosomes at higher magnification ought to be considered in the calculation. Apoptotic and pyknotic elements should not be calculated. 3. The specification of the final magnification (e.g., x 400) is not a sufficient basis for comparison of optical conditions for the mitotic estimation, since the visual fields of standard light microscopes may differ up to 2.6-fold. A temporary streamlining of the standard may be the application of a 0.159 mm2 visual field (x 40 objective, x 10 ocular by visual field value 18). As an intermediate goal, mitosis should be calculated in percentages of the tumor cells or areas of the total tumor tissue. 4. The interspecific reproducibility of the quantified mitosis makes it reliable for clinical application. It compares well with cytometric and morphometric methods in assessment of tumor cells and is of higher clinical relevance than the conventional histomorphological tumor grading systems.","2367":"Heterotopic tissue calcification represents a pathological event which goes along with active extra- and intracellular metabolic processes. The heterotopic calcification is not the manifestation of tissue ageing. Aetiologically, metastatic calcification, dystrophic calcification and genetic-hereditary calcification are distinguished. Two pathogenetic mechanisms play a role during the heterotopic calcification. The intracellular calcification is based upon the function of mitochondria as regulator of the calcium concentration and as \"lime-catcher\". The extracellular calcification is initiated by membraneous organelles--so-called matrix vesicles. The further steps are the production of hydroxylapatite crystals which are eliminated from the matrix vesicles in the extracellular spaces. Special types of heterotopic calcification are hypercalcaemias (tumour-associated hypercalcaemias, primary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, drug-induced hypercalcaemias), tumoral calcinosis, intratumoral calcifications, calcifications of different organs (lung, heart, vessels, joints, ligaments, skin or kidney). Some calcifications of organs show partly overlapping aetiological factors and pathogenetic mechanisms.","2368":"Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan. Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions. In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized. It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes--the telomeres--is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle. The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening. Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells. The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal. This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging. It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.","2369":"Gangliocytomas or gangliogliomas of the sellar region are very rare tumors. In a great proportion of those cases an adenoma of the anterior pituitary develops from the cell type that is hyperstimulated by the releasing hormone produced from the gangliocytoma. Five GHRH secreting gangliocytomas are reported. Four of these were localized adjacent to a GH secreting adenoma. In one case, no adenoma tissue was found beside the ganglicytoma. As only the adenomas can secrete GH, the adenomas and not the gangliocytomas are directly responsible for acromegaly so that such an adenoma has to be present in cases of acromegaly. A CRH secreting gangliocytoma was combined with an ACTH cell adenoma that had induced Cushing's disease. A ganglioglioma of the posterior pituitary had led to an inappropriate secretion of Vasopressin. The morphology of the different tumors is presented.","2370":"A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography. Because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits, tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis. Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed. The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier. Such fuels contain ethylene glycol (glysantin) as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria. The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure. Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure. At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed. Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.","2371":"Neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach are classified into four types mostly on the basis of their pathological associations: 1) carcinoid type I, associated with atrophic corporal gastritis, 2) carcinoid type II, associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, 3) carcinoid type III, sporadic, and 4) neuroendocrine carcinoma. The first two types develop through a histologically recognizable sequence hyperplasia--dysplasia--neoplasia. Their pathogenesis depends on the combined action of promoting agents, mostly hypergastrinemia, and of transforming agents, the role of which is currently under investigation. Their prognosis is generally favourable in sharp contrast with that of the other two types of tumors, which is usually poor. The pathogenesis and the precursor lesions of the latter neoplasms have not been clarified yet.","2372":"Nodules in the thyroid are common. They may represent hyperplastic or adenomatous nodules, true adenomas or malignant neoplasms. The main task of the pathologist consists of the exclusion or demonstration of malignancy. This can be done preoperatively by fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, intraoperatively by frozen section diagnosis, and postoperatively by investigation of paraffin sections. The intention of this paper is to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The evaluation of thyroid nodules still depends on routine cytological or histological specimens since immunohistochemistry, flow-cytometry and molecular biological techniques sofar failed to provide significant aid in the process of distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules.","2373":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN) encompass autosomal dominantly inherited diseases which are characterized by the syn- or metachrone development of neoplastic and hyperplastic neuroendocrine lesions in several glands of an affected patient. In MEN type 1 the parathyroids, endocrine pancreas and duodenum and the pituitary and in MEN type 2 the thyroid C-cells, adrenal medulla and parathyroids are involved. Due to the recent identification of the mu gene and RET protooncogene as MEN-1 and MEN-2, respectively, and the elucidation of the genetic defects in affected patients, direct mutational analysis of germline DNA allows for the unambiguous identification of gene carriers and therefore the discrimination of MEN-associated and sporadically occurring neuroendocrine tumors. This is especially helpful in the context of the fairly high de novo mutation rates in MEN, since the discrimination of familial and sporadic neuroendocrine lesions by conventional and immunohistochemical analyses is rather unreliable. While the development of neuroendocrine lesions in young patients, bilateral or multicentricer tumors and the combination of hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions are indicative for a MEN syndrome, such constellations may also occur coincidentally or in association with other inherited diseases. In this overview, most recent findings concerning pathogenesis, molecular features, clinics and therapeutic concepts of MEN-1 and 2 are summarized and discussed.","2374":"This review aims at describing the influence of established and not yet sufficiently characterized parameters on the prognosis of thyroid follicle cell carcinomas. The analysis of literature data covers a broad spectrum of pathologic and biologic factors from classical prognostic features like age, gender and tumor stage to mutation, activation or, where applicable, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, metastasis-related genes and adhesion molecules.","2375":"","2376":"A report is given of two patients with a history of splenectomy many years previously due to traumatic rupture. No vaccination was given to either patient. From a state of good health, both patients developed fulminant, therapy-resistant sepsis with proof of Streptococcus pneumonlae in the blood culture. Autopsy findings were similar to Waterhouse-Friderichsen-syndrome. In conjunction with the history of splenectomy, the final pathological diagnosis was a so-called OPSI syndrome. This postsplenectomy sepsis is discussed further.","2377":"The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described. Histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia. The patient died in acute cardiac failure, five weeks after initial presentation. Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium. Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal. The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were uncreative with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells. However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis. A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established. The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.","2378":"We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS. A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray. The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on. The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications. In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change. A cytomegalic virus infection was also found. A 30-years-old man presented patchy pulmonary infiltrates on his x-ray. The examination of bronchial secretion and bronchial washing specimens revealed P. carinii. In addition, the organisms were demonstrated in the walls of pulmonary vessels and in the stroma of the bronchial mucosa on the biopsy. In a sample of lung tissue which was taken after death, there were no Pneumocystis carinii anymore, but some proliferations of connective tissue with giant cells and calcification, which could represent residual changes of the Pneumocysts carinii infection. Besides, persisting changes of cytomegaly were found. We conclude that a Pneumocystis carinii infection should be considered in all HIV-positive or AIDS patients with any kind of lung lesions.","2379":"Capillary hemangiomas occur rather ubiquitously, but extremely rare within the wall of blood vessels. For this reason the authors report on a small capillary hemangioma of sinusoidal type. It has been observed fortuitously within the wall of the portal vein at autopsy of a 79-year-old woman. Based on site and structural characteristics the benign neoplasia is supposed to have developed from a local malformation, probably an abortive liver anlage.","2380":"The rupture of the free left ventricular wall is considered a serious complication following mitral valve replacement. We report about 3 cases characterized by similar pathologic-anatomical findings within the region of the left ventricle after mitral valve replacement. Following resection of the original and pathologically altered mitral valve and implantation of a prosthesis, rupture of the left ventricular wall occurred in short time intervals ranging from 1 to 12 h postoperatively. All cases represented a transverse midventricular disruption located between the mitral valve anulus and the resected papillary muscles. The histologic findings included necrotic, damaged myocardial structures with considerable bleeding to the interstitium. Inflammatory infiltration could be detected within the myocardial defects. Abnormal pathologic findings of the coronary arteries or intraoperative lesions could be excluded by thorough autoptic studies. Because of central localization of the ventricular disruption between the mitral valve anulus and the papillary muscles a direct traumatic myocardial injury caused by mitral valve orotheses is to be excluded. When taking into account several reports from literature in combination with our described findings, in autopsy, a loss of contractile integrity of the left ventricle following resection of mitral valve apparatus, especially the chordae tendinaea, should be considered as primary cause for this type of ventricular rupture. This destabilization will lead to a regionally stressec myocardial \"stretching\" which finally results in rupture of the left ventricular free wall. The described pathogenetic concept seemingly represents the decisive mechanism of this transverse midventricular disruption in all 3 cases. To prevent such post-operative complications, only very limited resection of the mitral valve apparatus should be performed to maintain parts of the chordae tendineae.","2381":"Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of approximately 0.6%. They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET]. The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma. Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and prognosis, especially in PNET.","2382":"A total of 334 hyperplastic polyps of the colon of 266 patients were examined under epidemiologically, morphometrically and histochemically. Of these, 62 cases (23%) were associated with adenomas, 18 cases (7%) with carcinomas. Hyperplastic polyps are not entirely homogeneous, pathologically and -anatomically: Carcinoma-associated hyperplastic polyps are larger in diameter, the size and width of their crypts is greater, and they have a higher percentage of goblet cells with a higher amount of sialomucins as shown by HID\/AB stain.","2383":"Atherosclerosis and its complications determine the majority of deaths in the western world, followed by malignant tumors. The present work introduces a classification of stages of atherosclerotic disease based on relevant pathogenic and therapeutic concepts, elaborated by H. Stary. At the present, we are able to relate different lesion types to a time course and partly to interferences between participating cell populations as well as to special pathogenic stimuli. From the therapeutic view, this knowledge is fundamental for preventive as well as interventional strategies like gene therapy. Distinct atherosclerotic plaques reveal a different composition and architecture, which may account for the variable risk for further complications of lesions showing the same size and degree of stenosis. In combination with an advanced clinical and diagnostic characterization of atherosclerotic lesions, the present concept might contribute to a better and differential therapy of atherosclerosis.","2384":"Since the first description of cytomegaly as \"disease with protozoan-like cells\" more than 50 years have past until a definitive explanation of the viral aetiology was reached. In the eighties cytomegaly gained increasing importance in adults. This event was based upon the occurrence of cytomegaly especially in patients with organ transplantation, AIDS infection, chronic dialysis or chemotherapy of malignant tumours. With the development of immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (IHS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) new, more sensitive methods became available to detect CMV infections especially in biopsy specimens or cytological material. With IHC, ISH and PCR CMV verification is possible in seemingly normal cells without inclusion bodies. PCR can be used also on small biopsy particles of paraffin-embedded material and is characterized by high specificity and sensitivity. The parallel performance of IHC and ISH was proved to be useful in routine diagnostic work, whereas PCR should be used especially in diagnostically different cases. The methods of the evidence of CMV infection are analysed in the different organs.","2385":"","2386":"","2387":"","2388":"The history of the German Neuropathology since the beginning of the 20th Century with its roots in psychiatry, neurology, and pathology and with its interconnections in these specialties til today is demonstrated. The changes in methods and in main scientific topics are mentioned just as the shadows fallen after a flower time in the first three decenniums in the international reputation by the expulsion into the emigration and the political persecution of so many colleagues, furthermore by the involvement in the so-called euthanasia. The institutional development since 1945 lead to the foundation of an own scientific society, own congresses, and a regulated training as the basis to win again international acceptance. Risks will be seen in the overspecialization as well as in the uncritical adaptation of molecular genetic methods.","2389":"","2390":null,"2391":"","2392":"","2393":"Progressive dyspnoea developed in a 37-year-old woman over a period of 2 months. A chest x-ray and echocardiography revealed a massive dilatation of the heart with thrombi in both ventricles. The endomyocardial biopsy was classified as myocarditis in two different departments of pathology. The patient developed thromboembolic events and an untreatable heart failure which led to the patient's death. The necropsy revealed a dilated 600-gram-heart and thrombi in both ventricles. On histological and immunohistological examination of the heart, the original diagnosis was corrected to catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.","2394":"Adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations. In some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated. In myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t(12;16) creates a fusion gene between the CHOP gene and the FUS gene and in lipomas the HMGI-C gene becomes rearranged by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region 12q14-15. Based on examples of a lipoma, a well-differentiated liposarcoma, a myxoid liposarcoma, and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors. Furthermore, the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases.","2395":"","2396":"Having observed 2 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung in a 49-year-old female and in a 66-year-old male patient, we present a review on this entity, which was described for the first time in 1987. Essentially this neoplasm has the same histological appearance as a Schmincke-Regaud tumor, but it is possible that a certain morphological variety exists. In the differential diagnosis, a metastasis of a Schmincke-Regaud tumor and a malignant lymphoma should be considered. Including our 2 cases, a total of 30 cases have been reported: 14 male patients aged between 33 and 73 years and 12 female patients between 38 and 70 years; in 4 cases there was no reference to sex or age. Most of the patients were Asians, mainly Chinese. These tumors presented with nearly the same frequency in both lungs. They mostly appeared as peripheral coin lesions in the chest X-ray study. Lymph node metastases were found in approximately 25% of the cases. Hematogenous metastases seldom occurred and were observed almost only in the skeletal system. In most cases a lobectomy was performed. At present, no exact assertion is possible regarding the prognosis. An association with an Epstein-Barr virus infection was observed in the Asian patients, but not in the Caucasian patients.","2397":"Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations. In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes. Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare. Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma). Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed. The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.","2398":"In the scope of a multi-center-study 35 resection specimens from patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation were processed histologically and graded according to the following regression grading system: grade I: no or only slight, in general spontaneous tumor regression, grade IIa: incomplete tumor regression with more than 10% and grade IIb less than 10% vital tumor tissue as well as grade III: complete tumor regression. In 15 patients with grade II a to III tumor regression roughly concentric foci of various size with a sequence of central tumor necrosis, narrow foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation were demonstrated as characteristic feature of response to neoadjuvant therapy. In patients with grade IIb to III tumor regression (\"responders\") median survival time of 27.9 months was significantly longer than in patients with grade I to II a tumor regression (\"non-responders\") with a median survival time of 12.7 months.","2399":null,"2400":"Cell-Cell-and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are important in the process of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

The most important diagnostic procedure was the detection of mycobacterial DNA-sequences in paraffin-embedded tissues using the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR). A combined antituberculous therapy lead to complete remission within 14 months after the diagnosis was established. The incidence of tuberculous mastitis among surgically treated lesions of the breast is less than 0.025 percent. Because of the frequent localisation of this disease in the upper outer quadrant of the breast and suspicious findings in mammography, tuberculous mastitis is one, even if rare, differential diagnosis for breast cancer.","2407":"In a regional quality assurance project for screening mammography (German Mammography Study), 27,335 women were screened in 40 participating, office-based mammography units from 1990-1992. Screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0.33. All biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the Mx physicians. Biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29% of cases within 2 weeks. With the exception of the dignity Mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results. The surgical procedure was known in the doctors' offices in 62% of the cases. Specimen radiographies were not done regularly. A pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases, respectively. With the exception of the histological diagnosis itself, no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely. Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely. Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations. A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.","2408":"The long-term disease free survival in patients treated by breast conserving therapy is similar to that of patients treated by mastectomy. In breast conserving therapy there is a significant risk of local recurrence. Although local recurrence does not appear to effect survival, there is certainly associated morbidity and attendant emotional trauma. Microscopic evaluation of the margins of lumpectomy specimens is the only way to define the extent of the tumour and the adequacy of resection. We intended to check the influence of standardized handling instructions for pathological examination on the results of histological margin assessment. These instructions are part of a practice protocol for all branches involved in BCT. We compared the results of our standardized margin investigation of 100 cases with the analysis of the margin status of 100 Lumpectomy specimens each from two other periods of time with different handling. Before 1989 only margins where tumor tissue was suspected when checked with the naked eye were investigated microscopically. From 1990 till 1991, margins were evaluated more intensively, but the evaluations were not standardized and did not consider the orientation of the ductal system, which was the base of examination after 1992. In 28% of cases, tumour tissue was found upon the investigation under the microscope, in the margins of lumpectomies where the margins looked clear to the naked eye. In the other periods tumour could be found in the margins in only 2% respectively 12%. Our results verify a strong influence of our practice protocol on the results of the examination of LE specimens: At first there is a higher sensitivity for tumor bearing margins compared with random sampling of margin tissue. Moreover, based on the consideration of the ductal orientation our protocol offers a better chance to detect in situ components of tumor in the margins. Finally with our method we are able to design exactly the tumor bearing margin and therefore we could take part in quality assurance of BCT.","2409":"Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men. In our own case series the ratio is 175:1. The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area. We should like to focus on the following observations: At the time of histopathological diagnosis, male patients with breast cancer were on average 67 (34-87) years old and thus 5 years older than women. Below the age of 40, breast cancer is very rare in men. The lag time between first symptoms and surgery was on average 42 weeks, i.e. twice as long as in women. In the vast majority of cases palpation of a retromamillary nodule was the leading diagnostic symptom. Mamillary secretion appeared to be an early symptom with favorable relation to prognosis by tumor size whereas diffuse breast swelling was an unfavorable late symptom. Bilateral carcinoma and double cancer (breast and prostatic cancer) was observed in one case each. Three patients (3\/51 = 6%) had a positive family history (breast cancer in 1st and 2nd degree relatives). The average invasive tumor size was nearly identical with 23 mm (s11.02) in men and 25 mm (s13.48) in women. Men presented more frequently with regional lymph node metastases (53% versus 45%), which tended to develop earlier. pT4 cancers were twice as frequent in men compared to women. In situ cancers were found in 2% (1\/54) in men and 4% in women. Similar to females, male breast cancers are predominantly of ductal histological type (NOS-cancers), classical lobular carcinoma with LCIS-components were not observed; special forms (tubular, papillary, mucinous) are slightly more common in men. When reviewing our series, need for revision of the origin of tumor was not found in any of the cases. Metastases of prostatic cancer were never misinterpreted as primary breast cancer. In case of isolated NSE-reaction, cancers with carinoid differentiation pattern are to be found in nearly every second tumor. However, when multiple markers were used (chromogranin A or synaptophysin) only 10% displayed such pattern, which corresponded to a positive hormone receptor status in each case. Quantitative (enzyme immunoassay) and semiquantitative (immunohistochemistry) analysis of steroid hormone receptor status was positive in 86% of 35 cases in men and in 75% in women. In contrast to female breast cancer, hormone status proved to be independent of age in males. The average levels of estrogen and progesterone were higher in men. Overlapping results were found only when cases were compared with postmenopausal women. The Nottingham prognostic index, a product of primary tumor size, axillary lymph node status and grading allows an approximative estimate of the course of the disease; its predictive value is higher than that of isolated tumor markers.","2410":"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is recognized in its classical form and as variants with tubulo-lobular, solid, pleomorphic, alveolar or signet ring cell differentiation. The most common classical form differs from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) by its slower tumor proliferation and less common axillary metastases. When compared stage by stage, long term prognosis is similar to IDC, however. Prognostic subtyping of ILC can be achieved by the recognition of variant forms and mitotic counting. The combination of these factors may be used for tumor grading (5-year survival 100% with grade 1 vs. 82% with grade 2, and 57% with grade 3, n = 241). The detailed histopathologic diagnosis therefore permits prognostic assessment also in ILC.","2411":"This review emphasizes the pathology of premalignant ductal breast diseases and its practical relevance to the patients management. The histological criteria for recognizing Ductal Hyperplasia (DH) are now well established. These include an intraluminal heterogeneous proliferation of glandular cells positive for keratins 8\/18\/19 and epithelial cells with expression of keratins 5\/6\/14. As a hyperplastic process the epithelial cells disclose an haphazard irregular growth with slit like irregular lumina (fenestrated growth pattern). The florid DH indicates a slight subsequent increased risk for cancer development. Our knowledge of the nature of noninvasive ductal neoplasia continues to evolve. Recent molecular genetic and immunohistochemical efforts have disclosed that atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) constituted a clonal neoplastic proliferation of an epithelial cell. Histological hallmarks of ADH are their cytologic features of uniformity and monotony of proliferation of cells and its micropapillary, cibriform or solid growth pattern. So from histology ADH simulates the highly differentiated DCIS, but can be distinguished from the latter quantitatively by the aggregate cross sectional diameter or the number of ducts that are completely involved by the atypical proliferation. ADH indicates a few fold subsequent increased risk for developing carcinoma. So this lesion requires a close follow up with 3 to 4 examinations per year and annual mammograms. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) consists of cytologically malignant cells in the parenchyma that have not invaded into the stroma. Recent studies have shown that DCIS is a heterogeneous group of tumors. Attempts have been made to classify it into histologic patterns, nuclear grades, tumors with or without comedo-necroses etc. We can draw the conclusion from several studies that the most important histologic feature is the nuclear grade. Holland et al. have suggested a very useful classification scheme that includes nuclear grade and histological features. The modifiers of treatment are as follows: 1. nuclear grade or differentiation of the DCIS 2. extension of the lesion 3. excision with clear margins So efforts to classify DCIS underscore the central role of pathology in determining the grade of the DCIS, its size and the adequacy of the surgical excision in terms of free margins. All three parameters are included in a score system of the Van Nuys Prognostic Index.","2412":"The frequency of biopsies with different types of mastitis among all patients with benign breast diseases in twenty years was 3%. About 2\/3 of the patients were younger than 50 years, the average age was 46.7 years. Comparing the frequency of the different types of mastitis the puerperal mastitis is very rare in contrast to the increasing non-puerperal and granulomatous inflammatory breast lesions. The diagnosis \"granulomatous mastitis\" is one of exclusion. Both non-infectious and infectious causes must be considered. The origin of the granulomatous mastitis often is unknown, but it is supposed to be an autoimmune localized response due to the retained and extravasated fat and protein rich secretions in the ducts in cases of hyperprolactinemia (drug induced or by microprolactinomas) or hormonal imbalances characterized by epitheloid cell granulomas with giant cells microabscesses around lipid drops, but without necroses. An idiopathic type of granulomatous mastitis concerns young women in relationship to parturition with a similar histological pattern predominantly of the lobules. Special types of mastitis are the B-lymphocytic autoimmune mastitis associated with a longstanding insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type I, the sarcoidosis, panniculitis and the rare but very different infectious diseases with breast involvement. Particularly in cases without features of secretory activity a carefully bacterioscopic and microbiologic work-up of fresh material from the surgical specimens is necessary for a final diagnostic report.","2413":"DNA flow cytometry (FCM) has become a routine method in breast cancer diagnosis for evaluation of ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis). Image cytometry is less practicable and provides less information than flow cytometry. An optimized technique with a low coefficient of variation is required for optimal results in flow cytometry. The S-phase fraction and the proliferation index (sum of S-phase fraction and G2M fraction) provide prognostic and therapeutically relevant information. A profound knowledge of the technique and its limitations is indispensable for the interpretation of FCM results. It remains to be established whether immunohistological evaluation of cell proliferation has the same prognostic value. Future developments are to be expected from multiparametric analysis and the improvement of mathematical analysis of FCM measurements.","2414":"","2415":"","2416":"","2417":"Acute leptospirosis in Europe (Weil's disease) is a rare and in more than 90% of the cases undiagnosed febrile, self-limited disease. We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure. Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe. The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm. Cardiac arrest developed, most likely due to hypoxia, with a drop in the blood pressure. Despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later. Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient. The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue. A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.","2418":"","2419":"Tuberous sclerosis (McKusick number: 19110) is well documented as an inheritable autosomal dominant disorder. On the occasion of results of an autopsy of a male fetus (1950 g, 29th gestational week) we report on the very early onset of a giant cell astrocytoma (microcalzified focally) and a cystic kidney disorder which in association with this phacomatosis is described first for this age. Thus, based on sonography there is a new differential diagnosis for the weighty prenatal diagnosis of a \"Potter syndrome\" or of \"cystic kidneys\". Moreover, on a chromosomal level we discuss possible connections between tuberous sclerosis and distinct forms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, ADPKD.","2420":"Benign fibroepithelial polyps of the renal pelvis are rare. Because of suspected malignancy in imaging procedures an ureteronephrectomy was carried out in the reported case. Histology, however, yielded no evidence of malignancy. The diagnosis of benign fibroepithelial polyp was entertained. It remains an open question whether the pathologic changes represent a hamartoma or a reactive postinflammatory process, revealing primitive myxoid stroma within the polypous portion and increasing fibrosis with diffuse submucosal involvement of the ureteral basis.","2421":"At the autopsy of a 68 year old man with plasmacytoma of the lambda light chain type we found polygonal interstitial cells with unusual crystalline inclusions, which were not readily identifiable and slightly resembled Leydig cells in conventional microscopy. In electron microscopy these could be identified as plasmacytoma cells, representing a testicular involvement. Comparable cells could be shown in the bone marrow. In immunochemistry we found a polyclonal reaction for lambda light chains suggesting a similar phenomenon as the so-called Russell bodies. As far as we know the literature, this finding in a testicular metastasis has not been described.","2422":"The intensity of DNA degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time. The aim of this study was the investigation of DNA degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues (muscle, brain, liver, bone) and with different formalin concentration (2%, 4%, 8%; unbuffered). An additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using PCR analysis. The smallest amounts of DNA were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone. The amount of DNA that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration, while at the same time DNA degradation increased. With the PCR-VNTR system HUMTH01, all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration.","2423":"Differentiation of a cutaneous lymphoma from a reactive lymphoid infiltrate is a demanding challenge for the pathologist. In this retrospective study we examined 24 paraffin-embedded tissue samples from lesions diagnosed as lymphomas and 7 control samples of skin affected by benign changes and with pronounced lymphoid infiltrates for clonal rearrangement of the gamma T-cell-receptor. Using PCR technology we demonstrated clonality in 22 cases of lymphoma (92%). Thus, the primer combination used in this study covering the four main groups (I-IV) of the variable region of the gamma T-cell receptor gene allows high sensitivity. No clonality was demonstrable in any of the 7 control cases. This study demonstrates the growing importance of PCR technology for the diagnosis of lymphoma.","2424":"Tumor of the follicular infundibulum is a rare proliferation of cells and its histogenesis or differentiation at the morphological level has been the subject of some controversy. In recent years cytokeratins have been recognized as important markers of epithelial differentiation, and of late new retrieval methods have meant it is possible to detect them in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. Four patients were studied, the ages ranging between the 2nd and 7th decade. The tumors were all located in the head and neck and in one case the lesion developed in a pre-existing sebaceous nevus. The morphological investigation revealed a flat, proliferation of polygonal, pale eosinophilic cells connected to epidermis or follicular infundibulum and with a centrally located nucleus. In addition, a few ductal structures resembling sebaceous ducts were seen and in one case a hair germ papilla and a follicular papilla was noted. Immunohistochemical investigations with antibodies against cytokeratins revealed differentiation comparable to that in the fetal follicular isthmus and, in one case, also differentiation in keeping with the fetal follicular infundibulum.","2425":"We looked for micrometastases in the axillary lymph nodes of 163 women with breast carcinoma, using monoclonal anticytokeratin antibodies. We found 26 micrometastases (2.1%) in node-negative patients (n = 17). Life-table analysis after 3 years detected the conformity of this group with the N1 group with regard to overall survival and distant-metastasis-free survival.","2426":"Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid. The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types #1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic (#5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK (#13) and against basic (#7 and #8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK (#19 and #20). With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19. CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas. Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation. Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied. CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers. In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas. These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies. New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression. This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.","2427":"With the introduction of the terms atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), the spectrum of prostatic diseases has been distinctly enlarged. With more sophisticated diagnostics, however, diagnostic and differential diagnostic problems grow more important. At the institute of pathology in Singen, this issue is reflected by the increasing use of the uropathologic consultation service since 1989. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate typical diagnostic and differential diagnostic problems in the pathology of the prostate on the basis of this consultation service. 573 submitted prostatic cases were evaluated and the final diagnoses were compared to the preliminary diagnoses by the primary pathologist. Frequent differences could be detected in the 3 following groups: 1. Differentiation of sclerosing adenosis versus well differentiated adenocarcinoma 2. Differentiation of AAH versus well differentiated adenocarcinoma 3. Differentiation of high grade PIN versus poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma 4. Differentiation of glandular G II a versus G II b carcinomas. Possible decision guidelines are presented.","2428":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the synthesis of antinuclear antibodies. Nucleosomes- the disc-like structural units of chromatin, composed of histones and DNA-are the primary antigenic structure that induces the formation of complement-activating antigen-antibody complexes in basement membranes. The autoreactivity in SLE has been elucidated in drug-induced SLE: hypomethylation of DNA leads to overexpression of integrin CD11a\/ CD18, increased binding of T-cells to macrophages and B-cells, a higher rate of apoptosis of macrophages, and elevated B-cell activity with consecutive production of autoantibodies. Disturbances of apoptosis (e.g. mutation of Fas gene) are relevant also in non-drug-induced SLE. The morphologic diagnosis-by light microscopy, immunohistology and electron microscopy-of skin and renal biopsies can confirm the diagnosis and help in prognostic assessment as well as therapeutic decisions in SLE. The value of the morphologic diagnosis in SLE is enhanced by reporting semiquantitative scores of disease activity and chronicity. The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, recurrent fetal loss and antiphospholipid antibodies. APS associated with SLE or other systemic autoimmune diseases has been termed secondary APS. Antibodies in APS are directed against phospholipids and phospholipid-protein complexes. One of these proteins is beta 2-glycoprotein 1. An important mechanism of the increased rate of thrombosis in APS is probably the inhibition of the protein C-catalyzed inactivation of clotting factors V and VIII. Venous thrombosis with recurrent pulmonary emboli and arterial thrombi in brain, heart and kidney (thrombotic microangiopathy) can lead to divergent clinical manifestations in APS.","2429":"","2430":"","2431":"We report two cases of patients (one 65 and one 43 years of age, respectively) who died of Streptococcus-viridans induced endocarditis of the aortic valve with perforation into the right atrium. Whereas perforation in Staphylococcus-induced endocarditis is a common complication, it occurs rarely in Streptococcus-induced endocarditis. Because of its uncharacteristic symptoms, the endocarditis was clinically unknown in both cases and was recognized to be the cause of death only at autopsy. To reduce the large number of complications in patients suffering from endocarditis, it is necessary to confirm the diagnosis as soon as possible if endocarditis might be suspected.","2432":"In the rare event of cancer-to-cancer metastasis, one malignant neoplasm spreads to a second carcinoma. To date, 42 such cases have been published in the English- and German-language literature. We report two additional patients, each with metastatic bronchial cancer present in a renal carcinoma. In addition to immunohistochemical examinations, we performed in situ DNA image cytometry of histologic preparations as a novel analytical technique to differentiate metastatic tissue from the host tumor. In both cases DNA histograms of metastatic tumor resembled those of the primary malignancy but were clearly dissimilar to the host tumor. In 70% of previously reported cases renal carcinoma was the host tumor while in 50%, cancer of the lung was the most frequent donor tumor.","2433":"Occupational formaldehyde exposure in pathology depends on the efficiency of the ventilation system in use and may reach concentrations considerably above the current threshold limit values. The reduction of formaldehyde exposure by stepwise improvement of the ventilation system at a pathologist's workplace is presented as an example in this paper. Assessment of formaldehyde concentration by personal air sampling at a workplace originally equipped with a hood ventilation system resulted in values of up to 4 ml\/m3 in the pathologist's breathing zone. Lowering the ventilation inlet to the working level by connecting the hood to a suction unit via a flexible hose resulted in an effective reduction of formaldehyde exposure to values of about 0.5 ml\/m3. This simple and low-cost technical improvement had some uncomfortable side effects, such as current noise and wind chill, which could only be overcome by installing ventilated work tables according to modern technical standards.","2434":"10 chondrosarcomas and 10 osteosarcomas were examined using cytogenetics and DNA-image-cytometry. Cytogenetically 6 of 10 chondrosarcomas and 4 of 10 osteosarcomas showed hyperdiploid tumorcells. By DNA-cytometry in 8 of 10 chondrosarcomas and 9 of 10 osteosarcomas hyperdiploid tumorcells resp. hyperdiploid stemlines were detected. This discrepancy reflects an in-vitro-selection depending on the different entities. In 7 aneuploid clones of chondrosarcomas the chromosomal ploidy was calculated using the relative length of the chromosomes and compared with the DNA-ploidy of the native tumor. There was a close relation between both parameters of nuclear DNA-content. The interpretation of cytogenetic results is improved using a combination of karyotypic and DNA-cytometric examination. This is particularly important for the search for relations between numeric chromosomal aberrations and morphological parameters (grading).","2435":"Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial solid tumor of early childhood. Histologically and genetically, neuroblastoma represents a heterogeneous group of tumors with significant differences in clinical behavior. In the past, several different characteristic chromosomal aberrations of neuroblastoma have been described, of which a deletion on chromosome 1p and N-myc amplification have been shown to be of major prognostic significance. However, the role of various other nonrandom DNA imbalances in tumor development and progression needs to be clarified. Taking advantage of the recently established comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we show that this method is able to accurately detect chromosomal imbalances of known prognostic impact. As CGH gives a comprehensive picture of genetic imbalances in just one experiment, it additionally sheds light on other abnormalities of possible prognostic relevance. We therefore recommend further use of this method not only in the field of research but also for the purpose of genetic routine diagnostics in neuroblastoma.","2436":"The maintenance of a normal skeletal shape and bone mass closely depends on a normal osteoclastic activity, as do bone growth and repair. Thus, the improvement of our means of therapeutic intervention will depend on our better understanding of the molecular basis of bone resorption and of the cellbiology of the osteoclast. This review-article presents our current opinion of the molecular mechanisms of bone resorption by the osteoclast. After describing the morphological features of the osteoclast, aspects as cell mobility, attachment, enzymesynthesis, transmembrane transport, osteoclast differentiation and function, as well as the protooncogenes c-src and c-cbl and their role for bone resorption are presented in detail.","2437":"Data in the literature communicated in 63 publications were evaluated in which scintigraphically warm or hot nodules were described as identical to a follicular or papillary carcinoma diagnosed based on histology of the resection specimen, thus suggesting autonomous hyperfunction of a malignant thyroid neoplasia. In the majority of cases, this assumption could not be accepted, or only within strict limits. In these patients, it appeared more likely that the carcinoma was located adjacent to or within a benign hyperfunctioning thyroid area or that large masses of a thyroid carcinoma had only simulated the picture of a hyperfunctioning nodule by suppression of endogenous TSH and thus of the residual parenchyma's function. In other cases, the diagnosis of a hyperfunctioning thyroid carcinoma had to be doubted or rejected owing to the lack of plausibility of the documented morphological findings. At the end of the literature survey, only 10 case descriptions unequivocally verified that, though very rarely, a papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma may manifest itself as a solitary warm or hot thyroid nodule. Such a scintigraphical finding thus cannot be regarded as proof of benignancy of a given thyroid tumour.","2438":"Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method for the detection of chromosomal imbalances between a tumor and a normal genome. In order to produce quantitative and reproducible results, we developed an image analysis program that allows the detection and mapping of the genetic alterations. The result is represented as a CGH sum karyogram in which the genetic changes are documented as color coded-chromosomes. The aim of our investigation is to correlate the genotype with the phenotype on the basis of CGH sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization that will supplement the morphological tumor description.","2439":"Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method of screening a tumor for genetic changes. The alterations are classified as DNA gains and losses and reveal a characteristic pattern that includes mutations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels. Although DNA from fresh-frozen tissue is recommended as the starting material, archival specimens can also be analyzed. Various examples are presented that illustrate the changes that occur in different tumor entities, and preneoplastic lesions, the differentiation of primary tumors from metastases, and the investigation of tumor cell lines that are resistant to cytostatic drugs. These examples emphasize that CGH can extend the possibilities for genetic diagnosis in tumor pathology.","2440":"","2441":"","2442":"In addition to metastasis, the differential diagnosis of multiple pulmonary nodules also includes tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and silicosis. Rarer diseases such as amyloid tumors, rheumatic nodules and plasma-cell granulomas can be the cause of this finding. This depends on the clinical manifestation. Based on clinical findings of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the problems in diagnostics using bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy and thoracoscopy are outlined. Etiology, morphology and differential diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis versus necrotizing inflammatory or neoplastic lesions are discussed. Treatment and prognosis are described.","2443":"We report a case of an intrathoracic, extrapleural, infantile rhabdomyofibrosarcoma in a 4-year-old boy. Histologically, the primary lesion showed extensive hyalinization and stroma sclerosis and was composed of relatively uniform spindle-shaped, at least focally rather polygonal tumour cells with scattered intracytoplasmatic globoid inclusions. Although chemo- and radiotherapy was given postoperatively, local recurrences and metastases in the lung and thymus have developed; the patient died of tumour disease 3 years later. Recurrences and metastases showed features of tumour progression with higher cellularity and increased mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells stained strongly positive for vimentin, desmin, and muscle-specific actin, and at least focally for MyoD1; the tumour did not stain for alpha-smooth muscle actin, neural and epithelial markers, or CD34 and CD31. The differential diagnosis of these aggressive tumours in the spectrum of spindle-cell lesions in early childhood is discussed.","2444":null,"2445":"The aetiopathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease is still a matter for discussion. Morphologically, these illnesses are associated with a broad spectrum of overlapping changes. Thus, pathology cannot serve as the logical basis for a new classification. Therefore this overview makes use of the conventional nomenclature of clinically established entities and includes recently defined lesions. Besides histological characteristics, details of differential diagnostic value are presented in the context of clinical and laboratory data relevant for pathological classification.","2446":"Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes. The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9. Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes. The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence (\"juvenile diabetes\"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed. Morphologically, a subtotal (&gt; 80%) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs. Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes. This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors. An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3\/DR4\/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e.g., viruses). Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and\/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestation. The course of the disease is dependent on age. Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.","2447":"The analysis and reassembly of the single steps in the pathogenesis of Heymann nephritis is reasonable well advanced, but still far from being comprehensive. It is established that antibodies against certain epitopes of the megalin\/gp330 molecule or RAP are responsible for the formation of glomerular immune deposits. Apparently a second antibody antigen system targeting lipid antigens causes the activation of C5b-9, which triggers the biosynthesis of oxygen-radical-producing enzymes within glomerular epithelial cells. The oxygen radicals cause lipid peroxidation which, by virtue of its toxic products, causes cross-linking of type IV collagen via its NC1 domains. It is possible that this is associated with a distortion and increase of permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, thus causing proteinuria.","2448":"Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules as well as extracellular matrix components are target structures of antibody-mediated autoimmunity that have recently been well characterized at the molecular biological level. Pathogenic autoantibodies against these molecules are causally related to disturbances of cell and tissue adhesion that become apparent as various (muco-)cutaneous blistering diseases. Desmosomal cadherins (desmogleins and desmocollins) mediate epidermal intercellular adhesion. Among these, desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3 are the autoantigens of pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, respectively, exhibiting intraepidermal blistering. The pathogenic relevance of autoantibodies against desmocollins. (IgA pemphigus) and desmoplakins (paraneoplastic pemphigus) still remains unclear. Hemidesmosomes contain the plaque protein BPAG1 and the partly collagen-like transmembrane protein BPAG2, representing the autoantigens of bullous pemphigoid and pemphigoid gestationis with subepidermal blistering. A certain subtype of cicatricial (benign mucous membrane) pemphigoid is characterized by autoantibodies against laminin 5 present in the subhemidesmosomal anchoring filaments, while epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and bullous SLE exhibit autoantibodies against collagen type VII constituting the anchoring fibrils. In addition, autoantibodies against a particular collagen type IV chain of the glomerular basement membrane are responsible for the manifestation of Goodpasture's syndrome. These recent molecular biological findings might be the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","2449":"","2450":"A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia. Additional retrosternal masses were proved. Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen. No germs could be identified. Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings. His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of \"wandering pneumonia\" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism. Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland. General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow. The unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction. The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms. Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.","2451":"The incidence of the prostatic carcinoma as well as the cases treatable by radical prostatovesiculectomy with curative intention is increasing. The exact pathological examination of the specimens defines the stage of disease and subsequently the prognosis and therapeutic consequences. The compatibility of different scientific studies is made difficult by the lack of a standard in the pathological examination of the specimens. Our exactly defined rational method helps eliminate these troubles and ameliorate the interdisciplinary dialogue.","2452":"The case is presented of a 51-year-old woman with increased of nightly dyspnea.

Most of these appear 3 to 4 years after the treatment of the primary tumor. Metastases have been diagnosed up to 11 years after the first diagnosis. The following is a case report of a 58-year-old man who developed lung metastases 27 years after the treatment of an aggressive local recurrence.","2454":"We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance. At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance. The boy also had curly hair. Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes. Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers. Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and beta-tubulin. Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.","2455":"Twelve cases of mucus secreting metaplasias, nine mucus secreting urothelial carcinomas and three cases of urachus remnants were studied using D-PAS-, m-PAS,- AB pH 2,5\/PAS-, HID\/AB pH 2,5- and PB\/KOH\/PAS-technique. Neutral mucins, sialomucins, sulfomucins, O-acylated and unsubstituted or C4- and C7-substituted mucins were detected in different quantities, often intracellular mucus mixtures could be seen. Many differences in the mucus quality of the metaplasias, in comparison to that of the tumors, were not noticeable. Metaplasia associated with carcinoma and mucus secreting carcinomas showed a loss of O-acylated sialomucins and besides diffus positive reaction in m-PAS-technique. Further investigations should confirm if this is really a prognostic factor. O-acylated sialomucins were not only found in metaplastic lesions and urothelial carcinomas but also in metaplasias of the urachus. Therefore it is not possible to distinguish between adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder and adenocarcinomas derived from the Urachus using PB\/KOH\/PAS method.","2456":"The influence of oral contraceptives (OC) on histomorphological and molecular biological prognostic factors was studied in 471 breast cancer patients. Differences in histological tumor type, histological grade, tumor size, lymph node status, hormonal receptor status, PCNA expression and c-erbB-2 protein overexpression were investigated in relation to the duration of OC use (&lt; 5 years\/ &gt; or = 5 years) and the time since last use. A total of 297 (63%) patients had used oral contraceptives at some time in their life; 186 patients (39.5%) had used OC's for 5 years or more. There were no significant differences in the tumor characteristics investigated with respect to OC use in general. Neither long-term use at some time in their life nor long-term use until breast cancer diagnosis had an effect on histomorphological and molecular biological factors. Thus, steroid hormones contained in OC's had no direct effect on prognostic factors in breast cancer.","2457":"CD34 is a myeloid progenitor cel antigen and present in endothelial cells and almost all vascular lesions. Additionally, CD34 has been described in numerous fibroblast-like cells and different mesenchymal tumours. The immunohistochemical evidence of CD34, however, may be of importance in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant soft tissue lesions, if clinicopathological features and other immunohistochemical markers are regarded properly. We studied the CD34 immunopositivity of solitary fibrous tumour at different sites (11 out of 11 tumours tested stained positive), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (15 out of 18 stained positive), and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (15 out of 15 stained positive), and discuss the significance of these results in differential diagnosis to morphologically comparable soft tissue lesions.","2458":"Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) is a new cytogenetic method, which is based on a combination of fluorescence microscopy and digital image analysis. The molecular genetic basis is the hybridization of a mixture of fluorescein labeled test-DNA and reference-DNA on normal metaphase chromosomes. Comparative analysis allows the identification of all unbalanced chromosomal aberrations of the test-DNA in a single experimental step. The resulting DNA gains or DNA losses on the chromosomal or subchromosomal level mirror possible amplifications of oncogenes or losses of suppress orgenes. As CGH can be performed with genomic DNA of formalin-fixed and fresh-frozen tissue or cells, this new method is a very effective tool for pathologists and cytologists in the extended genomic screening of tumors and genetically altered tissues. Despite CGH analysis at present is restricted to research applications; its widespread dissemination as a routine method in diagnostic pathology can be expected in the near future.","2459":"Mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations in human cancer, found in approximately 50% of all tumors. The importance of p53 in human cancer attracts attention in molecular studies dealing with the pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis in tumor pathology. This review summarizes the current understanding of p53 both on the genetic and protein level. Frequency and spectrum of somatic p53 mutations in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin and malignant melanoma are discussed including our own investigations and studies published in the literature.","2460":"","2461":"Despite many sensational and intimidating reports in the mass media, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) are not contagious in the usual sense. Successful transmission requires both specific material (an affected individual's tissue, from or adjacent to CNS) and specific modes (mainly penetrating contact with the recipient). Nevertheless, specific safety precautions are mandatory to avoid accidental transmission and to decontaminate any infectivity. The autopsy is essential for definite diagnosis of these disorders. Recommendations are given here for safe performance of the autopsy, for neuropathology service and appropriate decontamination; they are based on the current literature and on precautions taken in most laboratories experienced in handling tissue from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In essence, special care must be taken to avoid penetrating wounds, possible contamination should be kept to a minimum, and potentially infectious material must be adequately decontaminated by specific means. The full English text of this Consensus Report was published in Brain Pathology 5: 319-322 (1995).","2462":"Bronchiolo-alveolar tumorlets--mostly clinically asymptomatic--generally are noticed as \"contingent findings\" in the diagnoses of interstitial fibrosing lung diseases. The growth fraction of these epithelial proliferates in the WHO classification summarized in the group of tumor like lesions was explored by immunohistochemical stainings with the PCNA and Ki67 (MIB1) antibodies and correlated with (pre-) neoplastic lesions of the lung. The proliferation indices varied between 0.029 to 0.67 (MIB1) and 0.057 to 0.81 (PCNA). Depending on the main disease the observation of cuboid metaplasias, areas of bronchiolization via tumorlets in inactive interstitial lung fibrosis up to bronchiolo alveolar tumorlets following interstitial lung disease after cytostatic treatment showed increasing proliferation indices. Accordingly to prencoplastic changes of the bronchial epithelium the findings suggest that interpretation of bronchiolo alveolar tumorlets as basic cells of malignant peripheral lung tumors seems to be possible. The value of these findings in relationship to the associated interstitial lung disease is discussed in the context of reflections related to the formal pathogenesis of so called scar cancer.","2463":"Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago. As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate. An incidence of 2.8% was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands. As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods. Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and\/or smooth muscle actin. These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods. Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate. So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.","2464":"A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis). Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection. Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages. It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.","2465":"The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architecture is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells. The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer. From their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type II pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells. We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunohistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant. Both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar-like spaces were stained. The septal connection tissue cells did not react. These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituents and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.","2466":"We report on a female preterm infant of 29 weeks' gestation with severe hydrops fetalis who died 3 days post natum as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Autopsy findings included anasarca, bilateral pleural effusions, ascites and hepatosplenomegaly as well as multiple, up to pinhead sized, white granulomas on the surface of liver, spleen and lungs. Microscopy revealed storage macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, especially in liver, spleen and bone marrow, the lymphatic organs, the salivary glands, the thyroid gland and the suprarenal medulla. Cerebrum, heart, kidneys, intestines and placenta were not afflicted. Atrophy of the lymphatic compartments in the spleen, lymph nodes and thymus, as well as disorder of the liver texture, are presumably a secondary result. The diagnosis of Farber's disease was established biochemically by the demonstration of ceramide depositions in the spleen, and in fibroblast cultures in situ by the accumulation of ceramide released from loaded radioactive glucosylceramide. Ultrastructurally, corresponding storage lysosomes were found in macrophages. To our knowledge this is the first account of Farber's disease in a preterm infant with hydrops fetalis.","2467":"A giant Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) arising in the pericardium is described. A 53 year old woman was suspected to have a lung tumor and thoracotomy was performed. Intraoperatively the child-head sized mass was found to be localized in the pericardial sac. The histopathological interpretation of a small wedge-biopsy was 'endothelioma of uncertain malignancy' and heart-transplantation was performed two months later. The patient died of postoperative infection. Post mortem examination could exclude tumor rest or metastasis. The explanted heart revealed a large bulk of 2800 grams arising from the epicardium of the left chamber and enveloping the heart without invading the underlying myocardium. The histopathological pattern varied between cell-rich and -poor fibromatous areas and well capillarized endothelioma-like zones. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive reactions with monoclonal antibodies against Vimentin and CD 34 and no reactions against Cytokeratins and Faktor VIII. This pattern was confirmed in 7 SFT's of the pleura from our archives. A second control group of 7 mesotheliomas was positive for cytokeratins and vimentin but not for CD 34 and Faktor VIII. Diagnosis of SFT might be difficult because of its variability in histopathology, sometimes mimicking a hemangiopericytoma or endothelioma. Recent reports of tumor localizations devoiding serosal surfaces illustrate the diagnostic and histogenetic dilemma of this tumor. The differentiation of SFT from mesothelioma and endothelioma can be achieved by immunophenotyping including CD 34.","2468":"This report presents the cases of two female patients aged 54 and 57 years, both with colon involvement of type 1 neurofibromatosis. The first woman had a polypoid neuronal hyperplasia containing small Wagner-Meissner corpuscles, which had allowed identification of the neuronal nature of the lesion in a small mucosal biopsy specimen taken previously. The second patient had an idiopathic megacolon of the sigmoid, which had to be extirpated because of acute obstruction and ileus. Morphological examination revealed a typical plexiform neurofibroma of the bowel wall and neuronal hyperplasia of the colonic mucosa and submucosa, which had obviously caused disordered gut mobility leading to functional stenosis and extreme dilatation of prestenotic bowel parts. Gastrointestinal neurofibromatosis is rare and is characterized morphologically by neuronal hyperplasia of the mucosa and submucosa, sometimes containing small aggregates of ganglion cells by which it can easily be identified. However, in the majority of cases the increase of proliferating mucosal nerve fibres can only be confirmed by S-100 protein immunostaining. Furthermore, solitary, multiple and plexiform neurofibromas are found, but only the last, which arises from mesenteric or subserosal nerves, is virtually pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis. Gastrointestinal neurofibromas are usually late manifestations of the disease, but in exceptional cases they can be the initial sign of neurofibromatosis in patients who have no external stigmata that arouse suspicion. The occurrence of gastrointestinal neurofibromas should therefore lead to a careful search for other features of NF-1 in the affected patients and in their families.","2469":"\"NoToX Histological Fixative\" is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation. Intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested. NoToX was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step, otherwise the same manufacturer-specified protocols were used for all reagents. Conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used. In all tests, results with NoToX-fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis. NoToX is a useful substitute for formaldehyde.","2470":"In the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and a number of other tumors of the skin, the recurrence rate is tenfold lower if they are treated with micrographic surgery in comparison with tumors, assessed by parallel histological sections. We demonstrated this in our investigations including over 5900 cases. The rate of local recurrences in under 1%. The difference can be explained by the typical growth pattern of skin tumors. In the following article two simple methods of tissue processing are described, which can be used for formalin-fixed tissues and for fresh tissues.","2471":"Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only. Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6% of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas. Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated. Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers. In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels. All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour. Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed. The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months. Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer. The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account preoperative staging. Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification. Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour--including frozen section of necessary--in particular is of the utmost importance.","2472":"Low-grade myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (FMS) are two distinct entities in the spectrum of myxoid mesenchymal sarcomas with fibroblastic differentiation. Low-grade MFS is seen often in the extremities of elderly patients, subcutaneously more frequent than in deep soft tissues, whereas the majority of cases of low-grade FMS occur in young to middle-aged adults, commonly in deep soft tissues of the shoulder region, the extremities and the trunk. Histologically, low-grade MFS shows a multinodular growth pattern and is composed of round or polygonal tumour cells mixed with elongated, curvilinear, thin-walled blood vessels in a myxoid matrix. The tumour cell nuclei in low-grade MFS display at least moderate nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia. Low-grade FMS, however, is composed of bland fusiform tumour cells arranged in a whorled or swirling pattern, or occasionally more linear, and set characteristically in an alternating fibrous and myxoid stroma. Low-grade MFS recurs frequently but has a very low metastatic potential, whereas low-grade FMS is characterised by an indolent but ultimately malignant clinical course with metastases in more than half of the cases, which underlines the importance of distinguishing between the two entities.","2473":"","2474":"Many cell types of the salivary glands have clear cytoplasm. Causes of clear cytoplasmic quality in light microscopy are loss of organelles, storage of substances or fixation artefacts. Differential diagnosis of the different clear cell types requires special staining techniques, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. A new and distinct salivary gland neoplasm is hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma, which was not included in the second edition of the WHO Classification of Salivary Gland Tumors. Analysis of the collected cases of the Salivary Gland Register Hamburg and recent reports in the literature reveal that this carcinoma shows low-grade malignancy with localization usually in the minor salivary glands. Most cases occur in women. The pathohistology is characterized by solid or trabecular formations of polygonal clear cells which are surrounded by a broad hyalinized desmoplastic connective tissue stroma. The clear cells are mucin negative and express cytokeratin and EMA, in some cases also CEA, but not S-100 protein, actin or other markers of myoepithelial cells. Ultrastructural findings are undifferentiated duct cells with only few organelles and inclusion of glycogen granules. The differential diagnosis includes other clear cell tumours, especially epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma and the clear cell variants of myoepithelial carcinoma and acinic cell or mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2475":"","2476":"","2477":"","2478":"Periosteal osteosarcoma is a distinct bone tumor entity with characteristic morphological features within the group of juxtacortical osteosarcoma. Periosteal osteosarcoma is predominantly located in the long tubular bones, especially in the tibia and femur and is situated on the outer circumference of the tumor-bearing bone (saucerization phenomenon). In contrast to parosteal osteosarcoma, periosteal osteosarcoma is less differentiated and is believed to have a worse prognosis. In this work the histological features are described with predominantly chondroblastic differentiation of 14 cases with periosteal osteosarcoma. A horizontal preparation technique of periosteal osteosarcoma specimens allows comparison with computed tomography and is the optimal method to detect an invasion of the medullary cavity. Further studies are necessary to clarify if neoadjuvant chemotherapy could improve the prognosis of certain patients.","2479":"In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported. All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion. Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment. This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds. Now 76,000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.","2480":"Even today the name of F.D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today. He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases. He also described the phenomenon of \"bone remodeling\" which has become relevant today again. Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas. This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F.D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.","2481":"Osteoporosis is the most frequent generalized bone disease. The clinical expression of postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by spontaneous fractures of the vertebral bodies which affect mainly the trabecular bone structure. Thus the morphological bone transformation in osteoporosis is of clinical relevance. The object of this study was to analyze quantitatively and qualitatively the distribution of three-dimensional structure of cancellous bone in the human spine in osteoporosis. Therefore the complete anterior column of the spine and bone biopsies of the iliac crest of 11 autopsy cases with proven osteoporosis and 26 autopsy cases without primary or secondary bone disease were removed. A 1-mm-thick prepared sagittal section through the center of all vertebral bodies was embedded undecalcified in plastic and stained on the surface using a modification of the von Kossa method. This technique allowed combined two- and three-dimensional measurements simultaneously; these included evaluation of trabecular bone volume, trabecular interconnection, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number. The quantitative spine deformity index and qualitative analysis of the trabecular bone structure completed the investigation. The bone loss in osteoporosis is a loss of structure and the loss of whole trabeculae caused by perforations. The age-related decrease of trabecular bone mass is due to the transformation from plates to rods. Patient with osteoporosis show pathologically diminished trabecular bone volume and apparently reduced trabecular interconnection, while trabecular thickness and trabecular number show age-dependent change. The polyostotic heterogeneity in osteoporosis is immense. Neighboring vertebral bodies show differences of up to 100% in bone volume and bone structure. Due to this fact it is impossible to define a threshold for osteoporotic fractures. At the moment the transformation and loss of trabecular bone structure in osteoporosis is assumed to be irreversible; therefore, early prophylaxis is necessary to prevent clinical manifestations of these changes of bone.","2482":"Analysis of 402 solitary bone cysts demonstrates the wide morphological variation of this cystic lesion with regard to histology and radiology. Aside from metaphyseal location in femur (33%) and humerus (23%), solitary bone cysts are also often located in calcaneus (11%), tibia (11%) and pelvis (10%). Most patients are in the second decade of life. Differentiation between this benign lesion and malignant bone tumors is very important in daily clinical routine. The diagnosis cannot be based solely on radiological findings because of the variation of solitary bone cysts and the special forms, such as calcifying solitary bone cyst. Therefore, exact histological diagnosis is of particular importance.","2483":"Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy. Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis. Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22. In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses. There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation. Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods. In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems. Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma. The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically. In contrast to the cytogenetic evidence, it is not necessary to establish cell cultures.","2484":"Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity. In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis. The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation. In this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors (30 high-grade central osteosarcomas, 6 low-grade osteosarcomas, 8 giant cell tumors, 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts, 5 osteoidosteomas\/osteoblastomas, 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans) were analysed. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody. MIB-1 recognizes the proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells. Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30%) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors. This approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high-grade and low-grade osteosarcomas as well as bone-forming intraosseous tumors. However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.","2485":"One of the mechanisms by which multidrug resistance is mediated, is the mdr1 gene product, P-glycooprotein. Immunohistochemistry was performed for 63 osteosarcomas of 54 patients to investigate P-glycoprotein expression using the monoclonal antibody JSB-1. Most of the patients were children or adolescents who had received treatment under the framework of the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group. In addition P-glycoprotein expression was assayed in five growth plates. Of all cases 68.5% stained positive for P-glycoprotein. Cases that had received chemotherapy showed a higher incidence (80.9%) of positive P-glycoprotein immunostaining than cases that had not received chemotherapy (66.6%). No relation could be established between P-glycoprotein expression and the response to chemotherapy, since the majority of P-glycoprotein positive biopsies showed a good response in the surgical specimen after chemotherapy. Furthermore, 42.9% of P-glycoprotein negative biopsies were classified as non-responders in the later surgical specimen. In addition to P-glycoprotein expression in osteosarcomas positive immunostaining was also detected in osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts as well as in some chondroblasts. The results indicate that P-glycoprotein expression in osteosarcomas also exists prior to chemotherapy and resembles the phenotype of normal bone tissue. However, the determination of P-glycoprotein by using immunohistochemistry in biopsies of osteosarcomas cannot predict the response to chemotherapy.","2486":"DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis. The detection of a DNA-aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm, even in small biopsies. Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations. Low-grade central osteosarcomas may show single-cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a DNA-diploid stemline. Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.","2487":"207 osteosarcomas were examined morphologically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the COSS-86 protocol using representative slides of one whole tumor plane. The rate of responders 63%. In relapse-free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow-up period of 5 years. Within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas, metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in chondroblastic osteosarcomas. Therefore, in addition to degree of regression, histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas.","2488":"Representing only about 1% of all primary bone tumors, chondroblastoma constitutes a very rare bone tumor entity. 56 cases of chondroblastoma, that had been collected by the Hamburg Bone Tumor Registry from 1972 to 1995, were examined histologically together with the radiological and clinical findings. In addition immunohistochemistry with antibodies against S 100, PGM1, LCA and the proliferationmarker MIB 1 was performed. The mean age was 20.4 years and male patients being the majority with a gender ratio of 2.7:1. Predominant localisation was the epiphyses of the long bones, although almost 40% of the tumors were located at untypical sites. Usually a well-circumscribed lysis could be seen on plain X-Ray examination, however partial cortical destruction could be observed in one third of the cases. Histologically characteristic was a polygonal cell component with a weblike chonroid matrix, sometimes with a plane-like appearance. 5 cases showed a distinct nuclear polymorphism making a distinction from osteosarcoma difficult. Using immunohistochemistry all tumors except for one showed positive reaction for S 100 protein. Although the histogenesis of chondroblastoma is not completely understood, morphological findings as well as the observed reactivity with the S 100 protein indicate the chondroid origin. No reactivity for PGM 1 (CD 68) or LCA could be detected. All chondroblastoma showed a low rate of proliferation, thereby being distinguishable from high malignant bone tumors. In general chondroblastoma show a benign biological behavior. Different behavior was observed in 2 cases. One relapse located in the pelvis revealed local aggressive growth while in another case in the humerus a malignant transformation had taken place.","2489":"Chondrosarcomas are frequent malignant bone tumors. Aside from different subtypes, such as dedifferentiated, mesenchymal and clear-cell chondrosarcoma, chondrosarcomas (classical chondrosarcoma) show different grades of differentiation. The borderline between chondroma and classical chondrosarcoma is not clearly defined. The same chondrosarcoma can be graded differently at different institutes. Standardized therapy concepts are currently in preparation. As the Hamburg Bone Tumor Registry is often consulted for chondrogenic tumors, the histological criteria are based on a series of 74 chondrosarcomas recorded there. The emphasis has been laid on a classification which can be used in daily routine and which is reproducible and in agreement with the classifications of other international groups. Grade I chondrosarcomas (50%) can be distinguished only by growth criteria. The nuclei are small and show high chromatin density. Grade II chondrosarcomas (42%) have medium-sized, regular nuclei with loose chromatin structure. The chondrocytes of grade III cases (8%) show polymorphic nuclei. Binucleas forms, the number of mitoses and cellularity all show considerable overlap for all three grades. So far there are no immunohistological and molecular biological methods for reliable differentiation. The therapeutic consequences of the classification into grades are thorough curettage, in the case of grade I tumors, or complete resection, for grade II and III cases. The long-term results, however, need to be confirmed by a larger number of cases. From 1991 to 1995 the method was applied and proved to be easily practicable in daily diagnostic routine. Some 104 cases of classical chondrosarcomas (grade I 53%, grade II 39%, grade III 8%) were analyzed. Two pathologists both assigned the same grade in 90% of cases.","2490":"","2491":"","2492":"Problems in diagnosis of bone tumors in routine laboratories concern very rare tumors, differentiation between chondroma and low grade chondrosarcoma, the recognition of lesions containing multinucleated giant cells, lesions with secondary cysts simulating iuvenile or aneurysmal bone cyst and sometimes the discrimination of callus from osteosarcoma. Real misdiagnoses are done in ossifying pseudotumors interpreted as osteosarcoma, metaphyseal fibrous defect confound with giant cell tumor and chondroblastoma misdiagnosed as giant cell tumor or osteosarcoma. All these mistakes are avoidable if the clinical and radiological features, especially age and exact site in bone studied on the x-rays, are taken into consideration.","2493":"The speech recognition system DragonDictate-30 K is the first commercially available product for personal computers (PC) that includes a thesaurus of 30,000 words which can replace the computer keyboard completely for report writing.

On frozen section malignancy could be ruled out. There were nonspecific inflammatory changes. In the presence of a prominent eosinophilic reaction the possibility of a drug reaction had been suggested. Because of decreasing renal function, dialysis was started 1 day after lymph node extirpation. A renal biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis-again with eosinophils. At this point parasitosis was discussed. There was a slightly elevated titer for filariasis. Shortly thereafter, also eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides were found in the feces. A pulmonary infiltrate made its appearance, with eosinophils in the pleural fluid. About 20 days later, after dialysis and anti-Ascaris therapy, the patient was discharged with no further complaints. Repeated controls revealed no further complaints, especially no more Ascaris lumbricoides. This case had two special aspects: (1) initial presentation with painful cervical lymph node swelling, and (2) subsequent acute renal failure. The literature revealed only four patients with Ascaris lumbricoides infection and acute interstitial nephritis, all described by one author (Zollinger). Perhaps a special hyperergic situation in this patient was responsible for the renal involvement; however, this complication should be watched for in all cases Ascaris lumbricoides infections.","2495":"Oncocytomas are rare epithelial tumors of the major and minor salivary glands. Reported is an oncocytoma of the lateral wall of the left nasal cavity in a 60-year-old man. Because of its locally invasive character, with rupture into the left nasal cavity and partial dedifferentiation with loss of typically oncocytic features, we classified the tumor as oncocytoma of low malignant potential.","2496":"A 25-year-old patient with a rapidly growing sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder is reported. The diagnosis was made on the basis of extended atypical proliferations of spindle or pleomorphic cells in the area of pelvic floor and the radix of the penis. The tumor showed invasion of the blood and a high Ki-67 growth fraction up to 40%. Immunohistochemically, the reactions with antibodies against cytokeratin, EMA, and vimentin were positive, while negative results were obtained in reactions with antibodies against desmin, actin, PSA, S 100, human epithelial antigen (Ber-EP4), and cytokeratin 13. The differential diagnosis against myosarcomas, pseudosarcomatous lesions, and inflammatory pseudotumours is discussed. After radical surgery a pelvic recurrence and pulmonary metastases developed, which led to the patient's death 3 months later. This case shows that sarcomatoid carcinomas of the urinary bladder can be found even in young people.","2497":"Uterine tumors resembling sex-cord ovarian structures are exceptionally rare. Clement and Scully divided them into two groups. The first group includes cases with less than 50% and the second with more than 50% sex-cord elements. Group one tumors show a higher incidence of recurrences. We report a case of a 54-year-old women with a partly retroperitoneal, cystic tumor 7.6.6 cm. Histologically, sex-cord differentiation of more than 50% was seen with positive immunostaining against vimentin, desmin and focally against myoglobin and cytokeratines. The reaction against EMA, CEA and S 100 was negative. The patient was treated by abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oovorectomy. She shows no evidence of disease 2.3 years after the initial surgery. Based on the light microscopic features and immunohistochemical pattern, the tumor was interpreted as arising from the endometrial stromal cells or multipotential uterine mesenchyme that showed diverse differentiation toward ovarian sex-cord stroma and uterine smooth muscle with interspersed stromal cell clusters.","2498":"Inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are extremely rare. Worldwide only 50 cases have been described so far. In lung tissue, their incidence is higher, with 119 cases being published. Etiological factors are still a matter of debate; reactive inflammatory processes have recently been proved by immunohistological and cytophotometric studies. This seems to be true for both liver and lung locations of inflammatory pseudotumors. Considerable morphological heterogeneities, conspicuously varying from one case to another, reflect the numerous synonyms that have been created for this condition, i.e., plasma cell granuloma, xanthoma, fibroxanthoma, histiocytoma, plasmacytoma, solitary \"mast cell tumor\" and pseudoneoplastic pneumonia, just to number a few of them. This multicolored morphology explains the difficulties in histologic diagnosis, especially if needle biopsies or frozen sections are submitted to pathology. Differential diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver needs to include fibrohistiocytic neoplasia if spindle-cell-shaped areas are included or, on the other hand, parenchymal infiltrates of the nodular sclerosing type of Hodgkin's granuloma. Immunohistological investigations do not allow final decisions since spindle-shaped cells within pseudotumours can express vimentin and\/or desmin as well. Such histological cases should always include the excision of a piece of liver tissue of sufficient size to comfortably allow for the recognition of the multicellular composition and morphological heterogeneity of this process.","2499":"Resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89-year-old male patient led to the diagnosis, unusual at this age, of an inflammatory pseudotumor (synonym: plasma cell granuloma) of the retroperitoneum and mesentery, which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node. Histology and immunohistochemistry (demonstrating a myofibroblastic phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and polyclonality of abundantly present plasma cells) of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations. The etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled. The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.","2500":"Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastro-intestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus. We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa. It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.","2501":"There is ample evidence that the protease urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) plays a role in invasion and spread of tumours. Several publications suggest its biochemical measurement in tumour cytosols to be of prognostic significance in breast carcinomas. Our study set out to determine whether the immunohistochemical detection of uPA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancer tissues is of prognostic relevance. We tested 269 surgical specimens of primary ductal infiltrating carcinoma immunohistochemically using a modified avidin-biotin method. Some 57% of carcinoma specimens yielded specific positive staining in tumour cells. Detection of uPA correlated to tumour grade (P = 0.04), and to the detected level of the proliferation marker PCNA (P = 0.002), but not to patients' age or menopausal status, tumour size, nodal or steroid receptor status (P &gt; 0.05). At median 68 months' follow-up, 34% of patients had experienced tumour relapse and 28% had died from cancer. Clinical course was correlated significantly to tumour size, tumour grade, nodal and steroid hormone receptor status (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical detection of uPA, however, could not be demonstrated to be of any prognostic significance with regard to relapse-free or overall survival (P &gt; 0.05) in the total study group or in the N0 (n = 120) and N + (n = 144) subgroups, regardless of whether univariate or multivariate analysis was applied.","2502":"The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented. It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT). Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system. The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer. By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DOSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.","2503":"Primary thrombosis and phlebitis with secondary thrombosis of superficial veins are frequent. A biopsy may be performed if the clinician suspects an underlying systemic disease. The pathologist must be aware of the different types and their etiology because the further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures depend on his evaluation. The different types of primary thrombotic and primary phlebitic disorders are described and their possible etiology is discussed.","2504":"","2505":"We report a case of a 60 year old male who presented with a therapy resistant endophthalmitis which led to an evisceratio bulbi. Histologically, a granulomatous inflammation was present, in which acid-fast bacilli could not be detected. Molecular genetic examination by means of polymerase-chain-reaction technique (PCR) of the routinely processed tissue material revealed the diagnosis of an atypical mycobacterial infection, because DNA specific for atypical mycobacteria was detected. This example shows that PCR technique provides a useful tool in the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections as an adjunct to surgical pathology.","2506":"We report the case of an ectopic hamartomatous thymoma in a 56-year-old male patient. The lesion arose subcutaneously in the supraclavicular region. Histologically, the well-circumscribed but unencapsulated tumour was composed of uniform fusiform tumour cells. In addition, mature fatty tissue, scattered T-lymphocytes, and an epithelial and a myoepithelial tumour cell component were found. The epithelial differentiation of the spindle cell tumour component was confirmed immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy. Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma has to be distinguished from ectopic cervical thymoma, thymolipoma, ectopic salivary tissue, teratoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumours, malignant epithelial tumours with thymus-like differentiation, biphasic synovial sarcoma, and skin adnexal tumours.","2507":"A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism. A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor. Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas. Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor. Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated. A tumor in the liver was identified. Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology. Due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor. After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism. Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma. Only six similar cases have been reported in the literature. Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.","2508":"A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported. Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease. After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed. Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT. Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease. At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts. Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous. Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis. Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess. The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed. The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.","2509":"The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture. Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections. Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 microns. Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.","2510":"Recanalisation of the carotid sinus is one of the most frequently performed vascular interventions; endarterectomy of the coronary arteries is an auxiliary measure accompanying aortocoronary bypass. Enucleation of the sclerotic plaque is followed by reconstruction of the intima and by rapid smoothing over of the \"steps\" along the side of the recanalised segment by proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the remaining media. The thinner the residual media, the thicker grows the neointima. Occasionally elastic lamellae reminiscent of a lamina elastica interna are formed close to the lumen. Moreover, in some cases renewed formation of the characteristic intimal spur (fibrotic ridge) is seen at the carotid sinus inlet, a sign of continued irregularity of blood flow postoperatively. In contrast, no focal lesions are generally observed in recanalised segments in the coronary arteries. New sclerotic pads that occur in the late phase bear a morphological resemblance to those in operated restenoses. The distribution of these pads is largely congruent with that of the sclerotic plaques in non-operated cervical arteries. Thus, even when recanalisation of the carotid sinus is uncomplicated, reparative processes are followed by the reformation of sclerotic pads, largely determined by haemodynamic factors. In the coronary arteries, concentric rather than focal sclerotic lesions predominate.","2511":"The malignant B-cell lymphoma of the MALT-type shows significant differences from nodal lymphomas with respect to its biological, molecular genetic, and clinical properties. According to the proposal from the International Lymphoma Study Group for a Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms, MALT-B-cell lymphomas have been defined as an extranodal subgroup of marginal zone B-cell lymphomas and may have lower and higher grade types. We have applied this classification to 24 cases of primary B-cell lymphomas of the lung. These tumors showed histopathologic features of low (n = 20) and\/or high grade neoplasms (n = 4) recapitulating the structure of the acquired bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). According to our experience, the diagnosis of BALT-type B-cell lymphoma, is both practically feasible and reproducible not only for surgical material but even for biopsy specimens.","2512":"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant heritable disease that often occurs in association with various benign and malignant tumours. Clinically the disease is classified as VHL 1 (without phaeochromocytoma) and VHL 2 (with phaeochromocytoma). Genetically, VHL is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene. More than 100 germline mutations and rearrangements have been identified, but the biological function of a hypothetical VHL protein is not yet known. Genotype-phenotype correlations should aid in the understanding of this biological role. All VHL manifestations subsequently develop to VHL mutations, but some mutations may act in a tissue-specific manner. Whereas missense mutations cause tumour suppression to fail in adrenal cells, more severe structural mutations are usually necessary for tumour development in renal cells. As predicted by the tumour suppressor theory, the VHL gene also plays a critical part in the pathogenesis of sporadic non-VHL-associated tumours. In a large number of sporadic renal clear cell carcinomas, mutations and hypermethylation cause inactivation of the VHL gene. Together with allelic 3p loss, these constitute rate-limiting events in renal tumourigenesis. Insights into the molecular basis of phenotypic variability in VHL disease and the confirmation of the tumour-suppressor criteria in VHL and non-VHL sporadic tumours indicate an important role of the VHL gene in the development of these tumours.","2513":"A placental-site trophoblastic tumor is a rare neoplasia that is derived from the cells of the intermediate trophoblast. Morphological, biochemical, and Doppler ultrasound findings are presented regarding differential diagnosis using material from three recent cases. Essentially, placental-site trophoblastic tumors can be diagnosed if infiltration of the myometrium is seen by a monomorphic trophoblastic proliferation that is not interrupted by decidual cells. Necrosis and hemorrhages are not features of placental-site trophoblastic tumors. However, there is a peculiar behavior towards the uterine vasculature as spiral arteries are dilated and transformed the same way as occurs at the site of physiological implantation of pregnancy. It appears that as a result of this phenomenon there is a characteristic finding in ultrasound. Examination of this type of tumor demonstrates cystic spaces that can be defined as blood vessels by their Doppler signal. In two of the three cases a hysterectomy was performed, and criteria for the assumption of malignant placental-site tumors are therefore presented. However, only the mitosis rate seems to possess some predictive value.","2514":"The aim of morphological tumour diagnosis is to answer clinical questions on type, biological potential, prognosis and aetiology of individual neoplasms. The limitations and perspectives of different methods used in the diagnosis of adrenal tumours, ranging from histology to molecular genetic DNA analyses, are described. When surgical specimens from adrenal neoplasms cannot be typed on the basis of histology and\/or with clinica data (e.g., endocrine symptoms and history) as adrenocortical tumours, phaeochromocytomas or metastases to the adrenal, immunohistological investigations with a panel of different antibodies are necessary. After identification of the tissue derivation of an individual adrenal tumour, its biological potential must be assessed. Among adrenocortical neoplasms, adenomas and carcinomas can be distinguished by evaluation of various histological parameters (including structural features and signs of invasion) according to defined algorithms. In addition, conventional histology (by estimation of mitotic activity) allows the discrimination of tumours with especially high malignant potential from other adrenocortical carcinomas. In contrast, among adrenomedullary tumours even the combined use of histological, immunohistological and DNA cytophotometric techniques only allows the definition of risk groups (benign versus suggestive of malignancy), while reliable recognition of an individual malignant phaeochromocytoma is so far impossible. The question as to whether a particular phaeochromocytoma represents a sporadic tumour or a neoplasm inherited as one feature of a defined syndrome cannot be answered with the above methods, but only by the application of molecular genetic techniques.","2515":"In contrast to the panarteriitis nodosa macroform, the lung is frequently involved in p-ANCA-positive microvasculitis. Alveolar capillaritis, which may improve under immunosuppressive therapy, is a characteristic feature of this microvasculitis. We report on an 82-year-old patient who was admitted to the hospital because of severe hemoptysis due to microvasculitis. He died 3 weeks later despite therapy with steroids and cyclophosphamide. At autopsy alveolocapillary microaneurysms were found that may be residues of alveolar capillaritis.","2516":"Lung cysts were observed by chance in the chest radiographs from two women aged 20 and 41. In the surgical specimens the lesions proved to be congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation type 1. The cysts were partially lined by mucous cells. Also near the cysts there were circumscribed tubuloacinar proliferations of mucous cells. In both cases a transition into a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma was seen. Histochemically no sulphomucins could be demonstrated by means of an alcian blue pH 1 reaction in the tumor cells, but was demonstrated in the non-neoplastic cells of the malformation. In both cases CEA was demonstrated in the tumor cells. Some cells in the tubuloacinar proliferations were weakly CEA positive. In one patient the diagnosis of carcinoma was made by intraoperative frozen section and a lobectomy was performed. The other patient had first only a resection of her cystic lesions and had to be reoperated because of the results of the pathological examination. Both patients had no recurrence in the 8 years following the operation. In the literature we found 5 cases of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in adults. In 2 cases there was also an associated bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Several reports exist on the association of different kinds of cystic lung lesions and malignant tumors and their possible pathogenetic relationship. In this paper we draw attention to the development of malignant neoplasia in congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in adults and its diagnostic problems.","2517":"Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina. Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence. Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female. After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months. The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.","2518":"Dipterous fly maggots of different species live worldwide as parasites in hooved mammals. In the host the larval development causes typical boils, i.e., abscesses including the larvae. As a result of increasing tourist traffic, travelers can also bring back to Germany tropical types of myiasis.","2519":"The synthesis of pS2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS2 gene. The presence of the pS2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy. Furthermore, pS2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer. In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. Staining was evaluated semi-quantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS). The concentrations of pS2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay. Positive staining for pS2 (IRS &gt; or = 2) was seen in 27% of the tumors. Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26% of tumors had pS2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng\/mg cell protein) revealed an 81% concordance rate (r = 0.76; P &lt; 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status. However, the immunohistochemical pS2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P &lt; 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P &lt; 0.0001). pS2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66% of cases and PR-positive in 73%; 89% of pS2-positive tumors were positive for ER and\/or PR. The incidence of immunohistochemical pS2 detection was 41% in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and\/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7% in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).","2520":"Primary and secondary meniscal chondrocalcinoses lead to typical changes in X-ray pictures of isolated menisci. Combined X-ray, light and electron microscopic examination of the four menisci in 70 autopsy cases showed calcifications in 13 cases (18.6%). Three types of calcification could be discriminated with the help of topographical and morphological criteria: Type 1 A: disseminated calcification. All four menisci were affected equally. Crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) were found on light and electron microscopy. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) showed the crystal deposits to consist of 46.5% calcium and 53.5% phosphorus. Type 1 B: Calcification occurring in limited areas. A calcification was found which did affected neither a whole meniscus nor all four menisci of any \"quartet\" observed. Crystals were found next to areas of stronger meniscal degeneration. EDX showed the same results described for type 1 A. Type 2: Confluent calcification. A cloud-like diffuse calcification was discerned on the X-ray pictures. Light and electron microscopically pseudocystic structures appeared which contained a fine granular amorphous material. No crystals were found. The structures appeared in the neighbourhood of necrotic fibres. EDX showed 44% calcium, 51.2% phosphorus, 2.8% sulphur, 0.74% magnesium and 0.6% potassium. The findings lead to the conclusion that calcification type 1 A represents primary chondrocalcinosis, whereas type 1 B corresponds to secondary chondrocalcinosis. Type 2 was identified as postnecrotic, dystrophic calcification. Careful analysis of X-ray pictures of isolated menisci can yield useful information concerning pathogenetic factors of meniscal calcification.","2521":"Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies. We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia. However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piece-meal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis. DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC. These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.","2522":"For evaluation of the hormone receptor status in breast cancer tissues two methods are mainly used: immunohistochemical detection by monoclonal antibodies on frozen sections (ER-ICA, PgR-ICA) and the biochemical radioligand-binding assay (DCC) of fresh tissue. Using new antibodies makes it possible to evaluate the estrogen and progesterone receptor status in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. In the present retrospective study, tissues from 223 primary breast carcinomas or breast carcinoma recurrences were re-evaluated with the three methods mentioned above and the results were compared. We used antibody 1D5.26 reacting with the estrogen receptor and mPR1 specific for the progesterone receptor in paraffin-embedded tissue. The agreement of positive and negative cases between these two immunohistochemical procedures was 97.8% for the estrogen receptor and 85.7% for the progesterone receptor. Comparison of immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue and biochemical evaluation showed an agreement of 74.7% for the estrogen receptor and 68.7% for the progesterone receptor. These results are comparable to the correspondence between ER-ICA and PgR-ICA and the DCC method. This study proves that the prognostically and therapeutically important hormone receptors can be reliably determined in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. These results are not only important for the evaluation of hormone receptors of a small breast carcinoma that is not found in the frozen section, but for the considerable difference in costs among the different methods.","2523":"In recent years there has been considerable progress in brain tumor neuropathology. Several new diagnostic entities have been recognized, subclassification schemes have been modified, and new concepts on the histogenesis and cell biology of brain tumors have emerged. In 1993, a revised WHO classification of brain tumors was published by an international committee. This article summarizes the pertinent new aspects. As novel tumor entities, the central neurocytoma, the dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (DIG) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) have been included. Several histopathological variants of meningiomas have been added of which only the papillary meningioma and the atypical meningioma are characterized by an increased rate of recurrence. Meningeal hemangiopericytomas and hemangioblastomas are classified as tumors of non-meningothelial origin. The glioblastoma multiforme, which had previously been listed as an embryonal tumor, is now recognized as an astrocytic glioma. Immunohistochemistry has greatly advanced the practical diagnosis and classification of brain tumors. There are specific markers for all normal and neoplastic cell types except for oligodendroglioma cells. The prognosis of and therapeutic approaches to brain tumors greatly depend on histopathological grading. The WHO proposes four tumor grades, i.e., I, II, III, and IV. As a rule, grades I and II tumors are viewed as benign or semi-benign neoplasms and grades III and IV tumors as malignant. There are attempts to use new biological parameters for the grading of brain tumors. Antibodies to proliferation-associated proteins reflect tumor growth. Molecular genetic approaches to tumor-associated genes and gene loci are particularly promising new tools for the future.","2524":"","2525":"The case is presented of a 26-year-old woman with myxoid liposarcoma of the right breast who developed a relapse with anaplastic spindle-cell mesenchymal tumor 7 months after primary therapy. Additionally, 13 months later a bilateral adeno-carcinoma of differing histological grade occurred in the breasts. To the best of our knowledge, no comparable sarcoma-carcinoma sequence in the mammary gland has been reported. For this reason this case is discussed, with special emphasis on possible causative factors and the relationship to the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.","2526":"This case report refers to two patients with the rare entity of an extraneural metastasizing central nervous system tumor. The first patient presented with ipsilateral cervical lymph node metastases 4 years after a diagnostic biopsy and 2 years after removal of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma, respectively. The origin of the metastases was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The second case described was found in a 26-year-old female who had suffered from a spinal cord pilocytic astrocytoma in infancy and been treated by surgery and radiotherapy. On postmortem examination, transformation to a primitive neuroectodermal tumor was found. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of the metastases were exactly identical with those of the primary tumors in both cases. The pathomechanisms of metastasizing CNS tumors are discussed with reference to the reasons why such cases are so rarely observed. The incidence of remote metastases and differences depending on tumor type are estimated. No relation to malignancy grade can be detected.","2527":"Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue. In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen. This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy. The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.","2528":"Previous studies have concentrated on the proliferative behaviour of the neoplastic cell compartment in Hodgkin's disease (HD). The aim of the current investigation was to analyse the frequency of programmed cell deaths in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in the different subtypes of HD and to correlate this phenomenon with the expression of the bcl-2 oncogene. For this purpose, we investigated paraffin-embedded material from 63 cases of HD. Oncogene expression was determined by immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody bcl-2-124. The detection of apoptotic cells was facilitated by application of the in situ end-labelling (ISEL) technique. Our results confirmed that bcl-2 expression is low in the lymphocyte-predominant subtype of HD. Apoptotic cells were found in all subtypes to a variable extent and were not significantly associated with any particular subtype. Interestingly, there was no correlation of bcl-2 expression and the presence or absence of apoptotic HRS cells. Hence, other factors must be operative in the regulation of programmed cell death in HD. Such mechanisms have been described for lymphocytes under various conditions, such as negative selection in germinal centres and within the thymus, DNA damage due to irradiation, and cellular cytotoxicity.","2529":"Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) has been recently isolated from CD4-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes of a healthy person. The present study was performed to find the antibody prevalence of this virus in the healthy Mexican population. Two hundred blood samples from candidates for blood donation at the General Hospital of Mexico were studied with the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFA) in HHV-7 infected SupT1 cells. 83.5% were male persons and 16.5% female, the mean age for the male group was 28.8 years and for the female group 31.5. The donors came from 12 different states in Mexico, predominantly from the city (60.8%), and had different occupations. Almost all samples (98.5%) were positive to HHV-7. Other studies done revealed 1% positive to brucella, 1% positive to Hepatitis B, 2% positive to syphilis, hepatitis C and HIV test were negative in the whole group studied. There was a high incidence of HHV-7 in the group studied: more than 50% of the subject had high titers. This results should be further studied determine titers indicative of an active infection and to search for any association with illnesses.","2530":"An immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies against Ki-67 (MIB 1), PCNA (PC10), p53 and Lewis X antigen was performed on 47 squamous carcinomas of the larynx after partial laser resection. Ki-67 index and expression of Lewis X antigen correlated significantly with both tumor recurrence rate and tumor-free interval. A much weaker relationship was found for the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and no correlation existed with p53 expression. In conclusion, examination of Ki-67 and Lewis X antigen is thought to provide useful prognostic information concerning laser-resectable squamous carcinomas of the larynx.","2531":"To elucidate conflicting evidence concerning the role of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in the evolution of gastric carcinoma, a retrospective analysis was performed on the corpus mucosa of gastric surgical specimens removed from patients with gastric carcinoma (n = 53) and pancreatic carcinoma (n = 45). Prevalence, activity and degree of chronic active gastritis (CAG) were investigated. Furthermore, proliferative activity was determined by the expression of the Ki67 antigen in epithelial cells of the neck region and the foveolae using immunohistochemistry. CAG and intestinal metaplasia were significantly more prevalent in patients with gastric than with pancreatic neoplasms. Degree and activity of CAG were higher in the group of patients with gastric carcinomas. Numbers of Ki67-positive nuclei were significantly higher in pronounced than in mild CAG. Our data are in keeping with the assumption that HP-associated CAG contributes to the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. As possible pathomechanism, it may be assumed that a conspicuously expressed inflammatory reaction triggers epithelial proliferation, with resulting higher vulnerability to mutagenic effects.","2532":"In hematopoiesis, regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the microenvironment are involved. In addition to direct cell-to-cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix, soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication. Cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells. A common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity. By this mechanism specificity is reduced, on the one hand; however, on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced. A flood of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines. According to the results of our studies elements of the erythro- and megakaryopoiesis are the source of cytokines like IL-1 alpha, IL-3, IL-6, and GM-CSF.","2533":"The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection. Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary. The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood. Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery. Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia. Full-thickness samples of the ventricular walls, taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas, enable identification of early myocardial damage.","2534":"Renal tubular dysgenesis is a rarely recognized condition characterized by oligohydramnios, Potter's sequence and congenital anuria leading to stillbirth or neonatal death from respiratory failure. It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology, revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation. Two additional cases of affected sibs in a family with parental consanguinity are reported. Lectin and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule. Further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis. The clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed.","2535":"We report a rare case of colloid carcinoma apparently of urachal derivation. In a patient presenting with nycturia cytological analysis of urine led to a tentative diagnosis of colloid carcinoma of urachal origin. Endoscopic and radiological investigations confirmed this provisional diagnosis. For this reason, the surgical procedure could be properly planned and restricted to the removal of the apex of the bladder and urachus.","2536":"Computer-based three-dimensional reconstruction of serially cut light microscopic sections is being increasingly used in medical and biological research. Compared with conventional two-dimensional evaluation of histological sections, complex histotopographical relationships and structural details are easy to assess and could be imposingly visualized on the graphics screen. Because of the rapid progress in modern computer hardware, uncomplicated and fast reconstruction systems are available on standard personal computers. Therefore, 3D reconstruction is applicable for a wide range of investigations that warrant 3D exploration. Own results are presented and the principles of 3D reconstruction, as well as the problems and difficulties in this new technique, are discussed. The complex ameboid morphology of megakaryocytes in bone marrow of primary (idiopathic) osteomyelofibrosis is examined with this new method in combination with selective immunohistochemical staining procedures. 3D reconstruction can visualize the complexity of cytoplasmic and nuclear formation impressively. Moreover, the models generated permit exact quantitative measurements of cell morphology. The technique presented is a powerful tool for anatomical-morphological investigations and can furthermore increase our comprehension of complex histomorphological objects.","2537":"HHV-6 infected immature T (HSB2) and Hodgkin (HDLM2) cells and biopsy tissues from lymph nodes of patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and Kikuchi lymphadenitis (KL) were studied immunohistologically for virus antigen expression and for the oncogene\/anti-oncogene products ras, bcl-2 and p53. Cell proliferation and cell death were tentatively monitored in tissue culture by PCNA staining, by viability testing and in situ end labeling of fragmented DNA. PCNA was also used in biopsy samples. KL is characterized by high incidences of focal cell death (i.e. histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis), while HD is apparently more a proliferative disease. The techniques used revealed no significant differences in the cellular expression of viral DNA or antigens among cell lines, HD or KL. The HDLM2 cell line with the superior survival after HHV-6 infection showed a significantly lower expression of p53 and PCNA than HSB2 cells. Biopsy samples from patients with KL did not express p53, and ras and PCNA were observed in fewer cells than in HD. Bcl-2, however, was significantly more frequently seen than in HD. The interpretation of the data is difficult; they suggest that there are additional regulatory influences in control of cell proliferation and cell death, such as cytokines and growth factors, which are altered after viral infection. Also, virus-induced cell death probably includes other mechanisms besides apoptosis, such as cell damage caused by oxygen radicals.","2538":"The purpose of this study was to provide criteria for the differentiation of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) and focal involvement of the bone marrow by malignant lymphoma (ML). Using trephine bone-marrow biopsy specimens embedded in paraffin wax and unequivocally established samples with ML for comparison, all patients with questionable lymphoid or lymphohistiocytic marrow aggregates were re-examined, together with obviously reactive lesions. Following this procedure, a number of characteristics were found that differed in validity with regard to diagnosis. In addition to cytology, which is preferably assessed in Giemsa-stained specimens and evaluated by the Kiel classification, histotopography, fiber content, and immunohistochemical reactions are the most valuable tools for differential diagnosis. RLH is consistent with a central-perivascular localization, a distinctive border and the presence of germinal centers, no or only minimal reticulin fibrosis and a polyclonal reaction pattern with a mixed population of B- and T-lymphocytes, following staining with appropriate antibodies. In uncertain cases (i.e., extensive lymphoproliferations in HIV-myelopathy) the results of immunohistochemical staining are of definite importance for the diagnostic evaluation of these lesions.","2539":"Mucins are heavily glycosylated glycoproteins which exhibit a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and\/or peptide sequences. The application of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry resulted in a considerable extension of knowledge regarding their topography during histogenesis. Additionally, typical alterations of antigenic profiles during neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues were described. A number of new results are in keeping with the assumption that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumor biology, for example metastasis, and as markers of prognosis. The purpose of the present paper is to give a review, including the authors' own results, of knowledge on the gastro-intestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology.","2540":"Hodgkin's disease, especially its biology and pathogenesis, has been under discussion for more than 160 years. Numerous investigations have focused on the nature and clonality of Hodgkin cells, but so far no definitive answer have been yielded by immunohistochemistry, Southern blotting and PCR. However, the use of single-cell PCR has now made it possible to answer the question of the derivation of Hodgkin cells. Using a micromanipulator, Hodgkin cells can be picked out of histological sections and B-cell specific gene rearrangements (VDJ) can be amplified. With this technique it has proved possible to demonstrate the B-cell derivation of Hodgkin cells and their clonality. Mutated immunoglobulin genes in lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease indicate a germinal center cell origin of Hodgkin cells of this type. These findings, however, do not exclude cases of Hodgkin's disease with Hodgkin cells with a T-cell genotype.","2541":"Clinical and morphological findings recorded in an 81-year-old woman patient with a 45-year history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with long-term chloroquine therapy are reported. The cause of death was low cardiac output syndrome, which upon autopsy and postmortem toxicological analyses was classified as vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy. The pathogenesis and the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic effects of chloroquine are reviewed.","2542":"In this study we present morphological, cytological, immunophenotypical, and molecular genetic features of ten cases of AIDS-related primary brain lymphomas obtained as sterotactic biopsies, autopsy specimens, or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Histologically, a very characteristic perivascular and diffuse lymphomatous spread in the brain parenchyma was observed. By applying a highly sensitive in situ hybridization technique (ISH) using digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes, abundant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small nuclear RNAs (EBER) transcripts could be demonstrated in each case studied. A combination of ISH with immunohistochemical staining for latent membrane protein (LMP-1) and EBV nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA-2) showed different patterns of EBV latency with a predominance of the broad spectrum (EBER+\/EBNA-2+\/LMP-1+). Clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes were demonstrated in four cases using a sensitive polymerase chain reaction. In one patient the rearrangement pattern suggested biclonal lymphoproliferation. Our observations confirm the implication of the EBV in the etiology of AIDS-related primary malignant lymphomas of the brain. The demonstration of EBV gene products and clonal IgH rearrangements even in small biopsy samples is a useful tool for distinguishing between reactive and neoplastic lymphocytic infiltrates, which are frequently observed in brain and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from AIDS patients.","2543":"Histopathology of the bone marrow of diagnostic biopsies prior to any therapy is described in a total of 412 Ph1-positive patients. Special attention is paid to the distribution of megakaryocytes, increase of fibres and blasts, and occurrence of storing histiocytes of pseudo-Gaucher type. Megakaryocytes were significantly increased in 31.6% of diagnostic biopsies, myelofibrosis was found in 15.8%, significant increase of blasts in 2.4%. Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detected in 57.8% of a total of 412 biopsies. These histiological features are considered as an indication of the progress of the disease. A semiquantitative specification of CML by this criteria is described which can be performed rather reliably and defines the stage of CML at diagnosis prior to substantial treatment.","2544":"The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given. These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry. These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2%, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3%, essential thrombocythemia 22.1%, and polycythemia vera 20.4%; 12.0% of cases were unclassifiable. Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts. These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively. A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced. Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biopsies.","2545":"The histopathology of bone marrow in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is described, with reference to the FAB classification. Variants such as hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic MDS are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the FAB classification. The clinical significance of hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients. Histopathological classification according to the FAB system corresponds with cytological classification, as proven by the distribution of the subtypes, blood values, leukemic transformation rates and survival times. Finally it is even possible to elaborate a prognostic score for survival based on histological features of diagnostic biopsies, which emphasizes the importance of histopathological examination of bone marrow in MDS patients.","2546":"A total of 41,553 bone marrow biopsies were collected for the Bone Marrow Registry from January 1989 to June 1994 included 6,366 taken from 5,011 patients referred because of unexplained anemia. An increasing percentage of biopsies submitted for examination are designated anemic: this rose from 7.2% in 1989 to 18.9% within the first 6 months of 1994, reflecting an increased need to find the reasons for anemic conditions. Histologically, seven main groups have been found: (1) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) accounting for 32% of all anemia patients seen, (2) infectious anemia (23.5%), (3) iron deficiency anemia ((22.7%), (4) hemolytic anemias (7.2%), (5) aplastic anemia (6.8%), (6) megaloblastic\/pernicious anemia (5.0%), and (7) anemia due to bleeding (3.0%). These seven groups of anemia can be diagnosed in core biopsies on the basis of their particular histopathology, so that films of bone marrow smears are not always needed.","2547":"The histopathological classification of chronic myeloproliferative disorders can be supported by applying cytogenetics and molecular genetics to the analysis of bone marrow or blood cells, as demonstrated in 253 cases evaluated. The Philadelphia translocation (9;22) is the most important genetic parameter, being specific for chronic myeloid leukemia. Conventional methods for the detection of the t(9;22) are karyotyping and Southern blot analysis of the bcr gene. The newly established technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allows visualization of bcr-abl fusion even in non dividing cells. Molecular cytogenetics for t(9;22) yield results that are rapid and reliable as well as easily quantifiable.","2548":"Morphometric analysis of sections of biopsy specimens from patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) can complement the individual histological diagnosis and help to distinguish the four groups of CMPD. A total of 130 diagnostic biopsies from 29 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML.CT), 26 cases of (CML.MI), 28 of essential thrombocythemia (PTH), 26 cases of chronic megakaryocytic granulocytic myelosis (CMGM), and 21 of polycythemia vera (P. vera), and 30 from healthy control persons were evaluated morphometrically in sections of undecalcified plastic-embedded core biopsies. Clear distinctions were revealed in size of megakaryocytes, nuclear lobulation, clustering, and the nuclear size and shape of megakaryocytes. Nuclear size and cellular size were significantly less in CML (range of means of cellular size: 220-360 microns2) than in the other three Ph1-negative groups (range of means: 480-750 microns2). Nuclear lobulation was more distinct in PTH than in P. vera, and especially in CMGM. Clustering of megakaryocytes was more than twice as frequent in CMGM (8.0-10.5%) as in any of the other three groups (0.1-7.0%). Naked nuclei were more numerous in all groups of CMPD. The main topic of the study is the different size of megakaryocytes in the four main groups of CMPE, allowing a distinction between small-megakaryocytic Ph1-positive CML and large-megakaryocytic Ph1-negative forms of CMPD.","2549":"A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure. Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat. After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate. The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis. Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification. The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semithin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.","2550":"A survey is given of methods involving decalcification and paraffin embedding of iliac crest biopsy for osteological and haematological diagnostic procedures. In order to avoid shrinkage, loss of antigens, and fading of ferritin iron and enzymes, a fixative has been designed that is composed of an aqueous solution of calcium acetate (10(-1) M), glutaraldehyde (0.5%), and formaldehyde (1%; CGF). CGF-fixated specimens are decalcified in an aqueous solution of 10% di-sodium ethylene-diaminotetraacetate (EDTA) neutralized by tris[hydroxy]methylaminomethane and embedded in paraffin. Tissue prepared in this manner allows histochemical detection of naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase in the neutrophilic cell line and in tissue mast cells, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in hairy cells and certain other low malignant B-cell lymphomas, in Gaucher cells, and in osteoclasts, and a specific platelet esterase in megakaryocytes and leukaemic megakaryoblasts. A broad panel of antigens is well preserved. Beside haemosiderin, cytosolic ferritin can be detected by Perls' reaction in acute phase-stimulated macrophages. Emphasis is placed on the diagnostic impact of plasma cell siderosis and lysosomal sideroblastocytosis in haemochromatosis and in alcoholism respectively. A technique is presented to discriminate mineralized and non-mineralized bone even after decalcification.","2551":"Pluripotential haematopoietic stem cells and their progeny, the so-called committed precursor cells, i.e., progenitor cells which are already lineage-restricted, may be identified by the membrane-bound expression of CD34. In accordance with this peculiar property it became possible to enrich and characterize primitive precursor cells by using different methods of cell separation techniques, which involved fluorescence staining or ferro-magnetic particles bound to CD34 antibodies. Recently conducted studies demonstrate that CD34-positive (CD34+) stem cells of the peripheral blood represent a relatively uniform cell population with almost round nuclei, a finely dispersed chromatin pattern and a small portion of weakly basophilic cytoplasm. From the cytological viewpoint they resemble so-called large stimulated lymphocytes (virocytes). Ultrastructural studies are compatible with a paucity of organelles and a lymphoid character of these progenitors. In comparison, the stem cell population, derived from the bone marrow consists of more heterogeneous elements. These are generally larger and reveal an admixture of fairly immature as well as more differentiated cells, sharing bean-shaped or indented nuclei with prominent nucleoli and a more extended cytoplasm. CD34+ progenitors from the peripheral blood and those from the bone marrow display a co-expression of CD43 (MT1) and CD45 (LCA). Furthermore, different subpopulations exhibit--dependent on their origin (blood\/bone marrow) and to a various extent--lineage-restricted markers like CD33, CD38, CD61, CD20, CD11a\/c, glycophorin C und CD15 (LeuM1). The recently developed immuno- and ferromagnetic enrichment methods for CD34+ progenitor cells are considered innovative tools for modern oncology. These techniques play an important role in the treatment of haematological malignancies and advanced tumours in the context of autologous and, although so far rarely applied, heterologous stem cell transplantation procedures.","2552":"Autopsy findings are reported of a 51-year-old female patient with a 40-year history of mutilating psoriatic arthritis. As a result of this disease the patient developed reactive amyloidosis (AA-type) with generalized vascular involvement, amyloid kidneys and unusual amyloid goitre. The cause of death was ischaemic left ventricular failure due to massive amyloid deposits in the coronary arteries and left ventricular hypertrophy, the latter resulting from renal hypertension. Thus, amyloidosis and ischaemic heart disease were late complications of the underlying inflammatory disease.","2553":"An example of lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the thyroid is reported, which was first described 10 years ago and has not as yet been documented in the German literature. This tumour is morphologically identical to the lymphoepithelioma of the nasopharynx. In contrast to neoplasms of such morphology occurring in a variety of other organs, the acronym CASTLE--for carcinoma showing thymus-like differentiation--has been proposed by Chan and Rosai for lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas of the thyroid gland. In this paper, the aforenamed authors' concept of the histogenesis of thyroid tumours with thymic differentiation is presented.","2554":"To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a primary extracranial meningioma located in the palatine tonsil. Immunohistochemical investigation of the tumour showed coexpression of vimentin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). No staining was found with antibodies against cytokeratins KL1, 13\/10, 8 and 18, epithelial membrane antigen EMA and melanoma protein (HMB-45). It seems justifiable to classify this tumour as an atypical meningioma because of the local increased mitotic activity.","2555":"Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis was diagnosed in a 26-year-old woman with recurrent pneumothorax by histological evaluation of a lung biopsy obtained during video-thoracoscopy. A tumour of the right kidney had been removed 2 years previously; the histological picture was that of an angiomyolipoma. Immunohistochemical staining for anti-smooth muscle actin gave a strongly positive reaction in the tissue of the renal angiomyolipoma and in the pathologic lung tissue. Additional investigations showed an asymptomatic intracerebral tumour 5 cm in diameter in the left frontal lobe (brain scan). This multilocal renal, pulmonary and cerebral manifestation of benign mesenchymal proliferating tumours supports the classification of this case in the tuberous sclerosis complex.","2556":"We describe a 59-year-old woman with amelanotic polypoid balloon cell melanoma. Physical examination showed exophytic erythematous tumour simulating a basal cell carcinoma or an adnexal tumour. Histopathology revealed a polypoid tumour that was composed mainly of balloon cells in sheets and nests. Examination 37 months after excision of the tumour with 3 cm safety margins disclosed no evidence of enlarged lymph nodes or cutaneous metastases. Metastases to internal organs could not be assessed because the patient repeatedly refused further examination for staging. To our knowledge our patient is the first case of amelanotic polypoid balloon cell melanoma to be reported in the German literature.","2557":"Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material. Both routine diagnostic (e.g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e.g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application. We autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections. The technique has the potential to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.","2558":"The relationship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogene Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors. A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis. The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown. The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarcoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma. Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients. Sixteen cases (46%) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35%) were moderately positive for bcl-2. Seven cases (19%) were negative for bcl-2. The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics. Additionally the cellular proliferation rate was determined with the monoclonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitope. The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferation rate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification. To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.","2559":"The realization that malignant tumors may grow not only due to proliferation but also because cells don't die when they should provides absolute new directions in basic and clinical tumor research. Thus, apoptosis, the programmed cell death is very hot now in the scientific community. In the center of interest are the regulation mechanisms of apoptosis and its significance in different tumor entities. Recently, numerous studies on apoptosis during embryogenesis, different stages of tissue development and in epithelial and hormone dependent tumors have been published. The data suggested an important role of bcl-2 in regulation of apoptosis. In this view the demonstration of bcl-2 oncogene expression in osteosarcoma, a mesenchymal tumor, is of potential great interest.","2560":"The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors. Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer. In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation. Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA. As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise. The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.","2561":"The mitochondrial respiratory chain, which consists of five enzyme complexes, plays a central part in cellular energy metabolism. Thirteen of the protein sub-units are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, a circular DNA molecule of about 16,500 base pairs. Knowledge of the mitochondrial genome and alterations to it is essential to reveal functional defects of the respiratory chain. Point mutations, deletions and duplications of this DNA are associated with a growing number of diseases, whose clinical presentations vary quite widely.","2562":"","2563":"In a 69-year-old female patient a moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumour measuring 5 cm in diameter was initially misinterpreted as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. During clinical investigations to elucidate the cause of severe anaemia, 17 months later an ulcerated duodenal leiomyosarcoma was detected and removed by duodenopancreatectomy. Reevaluation of the thyroid nodule led to revision of the initial diagnosis to metastatic leiomyosarcoma. Six months later the patient died from cerebral stroke. Autopsy findings confirmed the diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of the duodenum with initial manifestation as thyroid metastasis.","2564":"Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques. Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae. Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and three-dimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus. Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age. They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males. The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters. In about 33% of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation. In non-invasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus. Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism. It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue. Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae. Osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus.","2565":"Autoimmune-mediated cell destruction in peripheral blood has been considered the most frequent cause of cytopenias seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. On the other hand, several bone marrow abnormalities have been documented by case reports as well as retrospective studies. In the present prospective analysis we addressed the question of the frequency and features of bone marrow abnormalities in SLE patients presenting peripheral blood cytopenias. In 12 of the 21 patients examined, we found foci of an exudative necrotic reaction characterized by edema, necrotic cells (nucleophagocytosis) and an infiltrate by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Reticulin fibers were increased in these foci in 8 cases. Surprisingly, hemopoiesis was hyperplastic in only 6 patients, but was grossly diminished in 12 cases. In 14 patients atypical elements of one or more cell lines could be observed. Most commonly (11 cases), an increase in megakaryocytes with atypical elements showing small pleomorphic nuclei could be seen, together with normal nuclei. Cell atypia in the erythroid line was found in 8 cases, and abnormal granulocytic precursors were seen in 3 cases. No ring sideroblasts could be observed in any case. All these features provide persuasive evidence that the bone marrow is a common target organ affected by autoaggression in SLE. Central and peripheral mechanisms acting to produce peripheral cytopenias must be assumed in most cases.","2566":"The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38\/69 cases (55%). The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis. Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients. Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses. Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.","2567":"The histopathology, ultrastructure, pathological status and clinical course are described in a total of 29 cases of inverted papilloma of the urinary bladder (IP). The IP was isolated in 16 cases and occurred in combination with a papillary urothelial carcinoma in 13 cases. Histologically, a trabecular, a glandular and a mixed type can be differentiated. The trabecular form predominates in a ratio of 4:1. The glandular form is further subdivided into a cystic form and an adenomatous form containing cylindrical cells. Contrary to earlier assumptions, dysplasia and malignant transformation also occur in IP. Amongst the 16 isolated IP observed, four showed slight and four showed moderate dysplasia. One isolated IP was malignant and invasive. In IP in combination with papillary urothelial carcinomas, malignant transformation is somewhat more frequent. Four malignant IP and up to 85% dysplasias were found among the 13 cases. The ultrastructure of IP reveals two cell types: a light cell form which corresponds to a slightly dysplastic urothelium and a darker cell form with or without microvilli which is observed in the glandular type. A frequent characteristic is a thickening of the basement membrane besides abundant \"tight junctions\". The immunohistochemistry is relatively uncharacteristic. This also applies to the blood group isoantigens, which showed irregular and relative uninformative results in the SCRA test. IP is observed in all age groups and the sex ratio (M\/F) is 3:1. The average age of manifestation is 56 years, about 10 years earlier than bladder carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2568":"Since the introduction of microscopic examination of tumours, many researchers have dealt with the relationship between cancer cells and connective tissue. Rudolf Virchow's opinion that carcinomas derive from connective tissue was soon disproved by the studies of Cornil, Thiersch, and Waldeyer, but no clue was provided to the reason for the invasion of the epithelium. Julius Cohnheim and particularly Hugo Ribbert were of the opinion that invasion of the epithelium was only possible in the case of a primarily altered connective tissue. Ultimately the stroma determines malignant growth. From 1902, Max Borst finally formulated the views on tumour-stroma-relationship that are still valid today and postulated interrelations which can only be proved and confirmed by modern molecular biological methods.","2569":"This review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years. Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls. These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a \"cannon-ball\" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; \"hobnail haemangioma\" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.","2570":"","2571":"","2572":"","2573":"","2574":"A 56 year old mentally disabled woman of short stature was admitted to our hospital because of severe chest pain and dyspnoea. An extended myocardial infarction in the anterior wall was clinically found and confirmed by autopsy. On admission cretinism with massive myxedema was diagnosed, which was confirmed by subsequent laboratory findings. Only at the base of the tongue thyroid tissue 3 mm in diameter was found. In the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland areas with nodular hyperplasia and microadenomas of TSH-producing cells were detected. Thyrotroph adenomas in long standing hypothyroidism are rare. There are only few reports on congenital hypothyroidism as primary underlying disease.","2575":"A pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition. Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography. We report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole. The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy. The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus. No malignancy occurred post partum. The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.","2576":"Visualization of proteins associated with nucleolar organizer regions proteins (AgNORs) on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded archival tissues is substantially improved after application of wet autoclave pretreatment. Silver staining results are comparable to those obtained on tissues processed in alcohol based fixatives, illustrating AgNORs as substructures of the nucleoli without any staining artefacts. A highly reproducible staining quality was achieved irrespective of tissue origin or duration of formalin fixation. As a result of this novel and simple method, the grounds have been prepared for standardized AgNOR quantification on archival material.","2577":"Heterotopic Ossification (HO) occurs as a consequence of several diseases and of various forms of trauma. HO is particularly frequent in paraplegic patients with spinal cord lesions. It is obvious that extraskeletal cells are able to differentiate into an osteogenic direction. However, the mechanisms of the induction process of HO and the stimulating agents are not precisely known. A novel tool for studying the ossification process at the level of transcription is the technique of non-radioactive in situ hybridisation. Using digoxigenin labeled cDNA probes we investigated the distribution patterns of types I, II and III collagen mRNAs and the mRNA of Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in heterotopic ossification of pressure sores of paraplegic patients. The three collagen mRNAs as well as the TGF-beta 1 mRNA exhibited substantially divergent distribution patterns. Type I (alpha 1) collagen mRNA was predominantly detectable in preosteoblasts, chondroblasts and chondrocytes of the ossification zone. Type II (alpha 1) collagen mRNA was nearly exclusively found in cells of the chondrogenic lineage. Type III (alpha 1) collagen mRNA was detectable at low levels in soft tissue, but was strongly expressed by chondroblasts and chondrocytes of heterotopic cartilage. In contrast expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA was found in a spatial different distribution pattern in areas of proliferation of mesenchymal tissue and in different stages of ectopic bone formation. As in the case of collagen Type I (alpha 1) and III (alpha 1) mRNAs the maximum of localization of TGF-beta 1 was detected in chondroblastic areas of heterotopic ossification. Taken together our in situ hybridization experiments provide evidence that chondrogenic cells play a central role in the process of HO with a phenotypic alteration in collagen type expression and a strong expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA. These findings support individual in vivo function for TGF-beta 1 in local cellular regulation of ectopic bone formation.","2578":"The incidence of primary CNS tumours in children and adolescents (0-20 years of age) was investigated for the time period 1970-1989 using the records of the East German National Cancer Registry. 2906 such tumors were registered. 93.2% of them were histopathologically confirmed. The incidence was 31.0\/1,000,000 for the male and 25.9 for the female population. 2719 (93.6% of all tumours) were intracranially and only 187 (6.4%) intraspinally situated. The incidence of the CNS tumours increased during the time period of the investigation. This increase was more pronounced in the male and less in the female population. The most common tumour types were gliomas (38.7% of all registered CNS tumours), medulloblastomas (14.0%) and ependymomas (10.9%). 130 primary CNS tumours occurred in infants (less than 1 year of age). Among these tumours were 21 ependymomas and 21 choroid plexus tumours.","2579":"The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs. The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 10(4) molecules\/micrograms cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 10(2) molecules\/micrograms cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine. Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values. It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 10(6) molecules\/micrograms cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 10(5) molecules\/micrograms cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 10(4) molecules\/micrograms cellular RNA). These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches. Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.","2580":"Local recurrence is a well-recognised problem in soft tissue sarcomas, especially at difficult anatomical locations or after inadequate surgery. It is logical to assume that such recurrence will have an adverse effect on prognosis. In most cases the histological appearance of the recurrence is very similar to that of the primary neoplasm, in view of the fact that recurrence is most common in high-grade (poorly differentiated) sarcomas. However, in some cases, the appearance may change in one of three ways: (1) Gradual progression in grade. This phenomenon is seen most often in leiomyosarcoma or myxofibrosarcoma, in which the tumour shows progressive loss of differentiation and there is increasing risk of metastasis; (2) Abrupt change to a higher grade. This phenomenon, known as dedifferentiation, is commonest (among soft tissue lesions) in liposarcoma and is characterised usually by the emergence of an \"MFH-like\" pattern and an increased risk of metastasis; (3) Acquisition of differentiation. Some round cell sarcomas in children become better differentiated after chemotherapy, and some dedifferentiated adult sarcomas may revert to their well-differentiated form; occasionally the appearance of greater differentiation reflects sampling error in the primary tumour. Pathologists should be aware that significant morphological changes may occur in recurrent soft tissue sarcomas and, in analysing and diagnosing such lesions, they should always review material from the primary tumour.","2581":"","2582":"Immunohistology was performed on 84 paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of malignant melanomas (MM) from a total of 74 patients. The series consisted of 62 cutaneous primary tumors and 22 (partly selected) secondary manifestations (9 cutaneous recurrences and 13 metastases). In 4 patients with lymph node MM infiltrates, clinical investigations failed to identify a cutaneous primary tumor. In the primary and secondary manifestations respectively, the following proportions of immunohistologically positive cases were recorded: vimentin 100% each, S100-protein 95% each, NSE 87%\/77%, HMB45 97%\/64%, NKI\/C3 97%\/95%, cytokeratins (CK) (antibodies KL1, CAM5.2 and 35 beta H11) 0%\/23%. Four of the 5 CK-positive lesions belonged to 3 patients in whom MM had occurred at first or exclusively as a lymph node infiltration. These findings confirm the results of other authors who report that positive staining results for CK can be expected in paraffin sections of secondary manifestations of MM in up to 10% of cases in large, nonselected series. This phenomenon appears, however, to be rare in primary cutaneous MM.","2583":"","2584":"An example of a benign haemorrhagic spindle cell tumour of the lymph node (synonym: intranodal myofibroblastoma) is presented, which was first described 5 years ago and has not as yet been documented in the German literature. This rare benign mesenchymal neoplasm of the lymph node occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region. Diagnostic criteria include its composition of myofibroblastic cells (with immunoreactivity for vimentin and actin), which may show nuclear palisading, the presence of peripheral haemorrhage zones and the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures, which have the ultrastructural appearance of dense meshworks of collagen fibers. Knowledge of this tumour entity is important for differential diagnosis of primary and secondary malignant mesenchymal neoplasias of the lymph node.","2585":"With rapid air travel, so-called parasitic infections are becoming more important in northern hemisphere and temperate climates. Parasitic disease is usually taken to imply infections caused by protozoa and helminths. The most important helminthic infections in man and with world-wide incidence are schistosomiasis, hookworm, and filariasis. We report the clinico-pathological findings of two patients with filarial infection of soft tissue and lymphatic nodes.","2586":"Based on more than 8000 autopsies of male and female patients without brain diseases the normal brain weight of adult males and females in relation to sex, age, body-weight, and body-height as well as Body Mass Index were calculated. The average brain weight of the adult male was 1336 gr; for the adult female 1198 gr. With increasing age, brain weight decreases by 2.7 gr in males, and by 2.2 gr in females per year. Per centimeter body height brain weight increases independent of sex by an average of about 3.7 gr. Body Mass Index is of minor importance and only relevant in males. Based on these data the independent variables, age and height, were for the first time combined in a nomogram for the calculation of brain weight. The mathematical functions were integrated in a computer program which facilitates the calculation of normal brain weights in individual cases.","2587":"In a retrolective and follow-up study the ipsilateral cumulative risk of breast carcinoma after histological benign diseases in women under 66 years of age (n = 1397) is investigated. The subtypes are mastopathy I (= changes without proliferative lesions), mastopathy II (= proliferative lesions without atypia), and mastopathy III (id sunt atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasias). The cumulative risk with mastopathy I and II over a 15 year time period corresponds with the ordinary age related risk, the cumulative risk with mastopathy III is four times higher (p = 0.001). There is no difference between atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia (p = 0.7). Women in reproductive age have a higher risk (p = 0.03), which exists even after a carcinoma-free survival of more than 10 years. The mastopathy is more a stigma for a higher breast cancer risk than a direct precancerous lesion.","2588":"This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseases. Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained. Different models of in vitro culture--monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures--are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpretation of in vivo tissue. Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.","2589":"The syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumour disease of the neuroendocrine system with manifestations in the parathyroids, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland and rarely also in the stomach and thymus. Recently, the MEN 1 gene locus has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11. This gene most likely belongs to the tumour suppressor genes, the allelic loss of which causes tumour development. The pancreatic and duodenal tumours may metastasize, but usually have a low malignant potential. Clinically, most MEN 1 patients present between the age of 20 and 35 with hyperparathyroidism and\/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.","2590":"Cytological, biopsy and autopsy findings in a patients suffering from massively metastasizing adrenal angiosarcoma are reported. Histogenetic typing of the tumour initially manifestating itself by osseous and liver metastases was problematic with regard to its partially epithelioid structure and its positivity upon cytokeratin immunostaining. Of relevance for the correct typing was the finding that the tumour cells in addition exhibited positivity for vascular markers. This case confirms literature data according to which cytokeratin expression not infrequently may be encountered in endothelial neoplasms and which by no means should lead to exclude such a tentative diagnosis.","2591":"The diagnosis of lymph node lesions frequently requires the employment of additional studies. Lineage and clonality can be regarded as the most crucial diagnostic parameters. In some cases the diagnosis remains ambiguous even after immunohistochemistry and molecular biologic techniques have to be applied. These molecular biologic techniques are based on specific rearrangements of the immune genes that occur during T- and B-cell development. Whereas Southern blotting has become a standardized and reliable means for the detection of lineage and clonality, the limited availability of fresh frozen material frequently restricts its clinical applicability. The polymerase chain reaction has facilitated the investigation of immune gene rearrangements in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. This communication reviews the recent developments in this field.","2592":"Although flow cytometry was initially used just to count cells, it has developed into a method of measuring the physical and chemical properties of individual cells when they are detected in a fluid stream by electronic sensors. With the application of fluorescence molecules, especially fluorescence-conjugated antibodies that are excited by focused laser light, the spectrum of application has expanded and has for years exceeded the traditional field of hematology. The article presents applications for pathology with the main focus on oncological problems such as DNA multiparameter analysis and proliferation assessment. In addition, the basic aspects of the different types of user-friendly flow cytometers are explained here.","2593":"","2594":"Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure. Malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion. Computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases, and recurrent blood in the stools was evident. The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission. Autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum (grade II) with metastases to the liver. High-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed, located within the mediastinal soft tissues and infiltrating the peri- and myocardium. Mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma. The lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels, leading to the signs of cardiac failure. The development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination. Malignent lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times.","2595":"We report a case of a primary renal primitive neuroectodermal tumour in a 24-year-old man associated with multiple pulmonary metastases. Histologically, the bulk of the kidney was replaced by a small round-cell tumour with numerous true Homer-Wright rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes; wide-spread vascular invasion was noted. There was no evidence at autopsy of a primary tumour elsewhere. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells stained strongly positive for O-13, a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a recently described cell membrane glycoprotein (p30\/32MIC2), more weakly for NSE and at least focally for PGP 9.5; the tumour did not stain for other neural markers, cytokeratin, leucocyte common antigen, or desmin. The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location and the relation of primitive neuroectodermal tumours and Ewing's sarcoma are discussed.","2596":"In male patients with congenital adrenogenital syndrome (AGS), in addition to the well known adrenal changes, tumor-like testicular proliferations may be observed. They have been known from literature since decades, but have become rare due to modern therapy. Especially in the mild and inapparent cases of AGS, the \"tumors\" cause clinical and morphological problems. The case of a 34 year old male AGS patient is presented, who underwent resection of a large adrenal cortical adenoma at age 28. Six years later, orchiectomy followed because of a testicular tumor. In frozen sections, the \"Leydig cell-like\" tumor caused diagnostic difficulties. After usual embedding and examination, the diagnosis of testicular \"tumor\" in AGS was confirmed. By review of the literature, pathomorphogenesis and morphology of these testicular tumors as well as possible histogenesis of their cells are discussed. Because of the close similarity to Leydig cell tumors, this most important differential diagnosis is especially considered. As a rule, testicular tumors in AGS are no indication for orchiectomy.","2597":"Variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) are highly polymorphic DNA sequences which can be used as genetic markers in different fields of medicine. In this report, we describe the methodology of VNTR in diagnostic molecular pathology, using a rapid, DNA-based approach involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and electrophoresis of highly polymorphic DNA satellite sequences. As concrete examples of the application of this approach, we present two case reports: 1. A B-cell lymphoma of the porta hepatis developed in a 54-year-old man 4.5 months after orthotopic liver transplantation for liver failure due to chronic hepatitis C infection. Using DNA polymorphisms as genetic markers, we showed that the tumor was of donor origin. This finding may be important for the patient's subsequent management. 2. An immature teratoma of the left ovary was found during delivery by cesarean section in a 27-year-old woman. The female newborn survived for 9 weeks and then died from central dysregulation because of an intracranial immature teratoma. Because the synchronous tumors were of similar histology, clonal origin in maternal tissues and metastatic spread were initially suspected. Analysis of highly polymorphic DNA markers clearly indicated that the teratoma carried by the child was of independent genetic origin from the mother's tumor.","2598":"Ewing's sarcomas and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (MPNTs) show very little evidence of differentiation and lack characteristic morphological features at the light-microscopic level. These malignancies have always presented a significant differential diagnostic challenge to the pathologist. Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining for neural antigens such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Leu 7, synaptophysin and, more recently, the detection of Mic-2 gene expression have been included in the routine histopathological diagnostic procedure. However, the expression of these antigens is not restricted to this entity. Thus, further modalities are required to prove diagnostic reliability. One consistent feature of the Ewing's sarcoma family is the presence of the reciprocal chromosomal t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation. Recent cloning of the t(11;22) break point has led to the identification of the genes involved in this translocation. This provides the possibility of molecular genetic detection of the t(11;22) translocation in Ewing's sarcomas and MPNTs. We have established a method using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of the specific gene fusion transcript caused by the 11;22 translocation. The validity of our approach was proved by analyzing Ewing's tumor cell lines and tissue material obtained from primary biopsies and tumor resections. Molecular genetic detection of the 11;22 translocation by RT-PCR analysis should perhaps be included in the diagnostic work-up of suspected Ewing's sarcoma and MPNT.","2599":"In situ hybridisation is a sensitive and reliable technique for the demonstration of DNA- or mRNA-sequences on histological tissue preparations. This review deals with the theoretical background as well as the benefits and limitations of the method; additionally the value of in situ hybridisation as a tool in routine diagnostic pathology is briefly described.","2600":"","2601":"","2602":"","2603":"A 48-year-old male experienced sudden pain in the right flank and macrohematuria with subsequent repeated episodes of painless macrohematuria. In the radiological work-up, CT was interpreted as inflammatory enlargement of the right kidney and MRI diagnosed renal vein thrombosis. There was some suspicion that there might be a malignancy. Five months later the patient had to be admitted to the hospital, because of increasing flank pain, desiccation and general signs of inflammatory disease. Radiological changes compatible with pulmonary metastases were found. Biopsy of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes revealed undifferentiated carcinoma. Because of the expression of Cytokeratin primary urothelial carcinoma was suspected. The patient then deteriorated rapidly. No further specific therapy could be carried out. Death was chiefly caused by respiratory insufficiency 5 months after the first episode of pain and 1 month after admission. Autopsy revealed a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma of the right renal pelvis, with extensive carcinomatous angiomatosis and metastases to the left kidney, lungs, and regional and mediastinal lymph nodes. Independently of the carcinoma, both kidneys also showed interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis and capillarosclerosis, compatible with analgesic-user kidney (\"phenacetin kidney\") in the absence of a corresponding history.","2604":"Primary sarcomas of the liver are rare, and hepatic rhabdomyosarcomas are usually confined to early childhood. They are mostly related to large bile ducts of the liver hilus. We report a case of primary hepatic pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma in a 69-year-old man.","2605":null,"2606":"An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature. The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells. The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.","2607":"Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch. Seven cases have been reported to date. We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man. Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain. These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple sclerosis. The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation. The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock. The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.","2608":"Two cases of granulomatous endocarditis are reported. The patients developed aortal endocarditis refractory to antibiotics. Therefore, aortal valve replacement was performed. In both cases, Streptococcus viridans was demonstrated in culture and bacterioscopically to be the cause of infection. Histological examination of the valves showed characteristic endocarditis with fibrinoid necrosis and histiocytic granulomas. Streptococci were found in the cytoplasm of macrophages. The possible causes of this special form of infectious endocarditis are discussed.","2609":"Morphological examination methods which are appropriate for detection of embryonic developmental defects are presented. The main emphasis is put on autopsy of small embryos using a dissection microscope and on documentation of the embryonic skeleton by means of skeleton staining. Through presentation of the embryopathological findings in 15 first-trimester abortion specimens we demonstrate that these examination techniques frequently allow diagnosis of isolated malformations as well as malformation syndromes, even in the fragmented or macerated embryo. Careful embryopathological examination and evaluation is a precondition for genetic counselling, as well as for goal-directed prenatal diagnostic measures in future pregnancies.","2610":"Histological examination of 1660 biopsies (2-5 mm) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection; in 70% of all cases non-specific changes were revealed and in 30% specific changes. The findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer, uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum synoviale and fibrosis of the stroma, vascular proliferation and pseudopolypoid thickening of the synovial membrane. The histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained, e.g., detritus synovialitis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic changes, if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings.","2611":"Characteristic skeletal changes occur in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The aim of this study was comprehensively to record bone volume changes in the spine, from C2 to L5, after a long history of hemodialysis. The spinal columns of nine autopsy cases who had undergone 4 to 15 years of dialysis were thoroughly examined. The age-related control group consisted of 26 autopsy cases with intact skeletons. A iliac crest biopsy facilitated a direct comparison of the diagnostic biopsy location and the spinal column. A newly developed preparation technique enables a combined two- and three-dimensional analysis to be made, so that in addition to the histologic image, the directly underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed. The spine deformity index (SDI), the bone volume (BV\/TV), and the trabecular interconnection (TBPf) was quantitatively evaluated. The SDI shows vertebral fractures in renal osteodystrophy (ROD) types I and II in spite of a trabecular bone volume within normal limits. The trabecular bone volume shows a distribution throughout the spinal column familiar from the skeletally intact control group. The plateau-like curve line, decreasing from the cervical spine to the lumbar spine is, however, 5% lower in ROD. BV\/TV values of 51.2% and 74.1% in the 2nd lumbar vertebra are clearly lower than in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy. Cases with a longer history of hemodialysis show higher BV\/TV values irrespective of age and sex. Normal BV\/TV does not mean physiological linking. Three-dimensional analysis in ROD shows, in comparison to the controls, a much stronger restructuring of the architecture than can be assumed from the two-dimensional histological sections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2612":"With spontaneous abortion the conceptus is often expelled and lost right at the beginning, and uterine curettings then contain only endometrial fragments and clotted blood. Even complete embedding of all available material for histologic examination will not reveal any chorionic villi, and ectopic pregnancy can thus not be excluded. In such cases, the intermediate trophoblast can sometimes still be demonstrated within the endometrial tissue. This highly invasive trophoblast is difficult to identify using conventional staining, but cytokeratin antibodies are reliable markers of this cell type. Using immunohistochemistry, these fetal components could be demonstrated in 27 of 95 specimens (28.5%), proving the intrauterine nature of the aborted pregnancy. In some cases the fetal derivation of intermediate trophoblast was demonstrated by using in situ hybridisation to mark repetitive sequences on the Y-chromosome in the interphase nucleus.","2613":"","2614":"","2615":"A rare case of teratoma of the umbilical cord is reported. It is differentiated from acardius amorphus and compared with the nine cases reported in the literature since the first description in 1878. The clinical consequences for pregnancy of the tumour's influence on the circulation are discussed. For the first time, non-radioactive in situ hybridization of the interphase nucleus was performed in a teratoma of the umbilical cord.

Als for the autopsy of suspected TSE patients, safety measures have to be taken. The brain preparation, in particular, represents a considerable risk which must be minimized by appropriate safety measures. Conventional formaldehyde fixation does not decontaminate tissues! Embedding, cutting, deparaffinization and processing or staining have to be done with cautions; members of staff must be aware of the danger. After the handling of suspect materials, the hands should be washed without brushing the skin. In the case of percutaneous inoculation the injury must be decontaminated immediately using iodine- or phenol-containing preparations, 0.5 M NaOH or 1:3000 potassium permanganate.","2626":"Eighty male and female doctors of various ages working in a general hospital were questioned on their feelings on being confronted with human corpses and the possible effects of the experience. Their responses were analysed and compared with those of 100 male and female medical students. The potential short-term effects and lasting consequences are many and varied. Forty-four per cent of the doctors reported that repeated dealings with the bodies of patients known to them did not lead to habituation. A high proportion of the students and doctors stated that exposure to corpses had a positive effect on their dealings with living patients. The reluctance of some doctors to attend autopsies of their patients is connected with their difficulties in coping with the experience. Further, more detailed studies are called for.","2627":"","2628":"","2629":"Cathepsin D expression was immunohistochemically tested in 126 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from primary breast cancers. Specific staining was noted in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 43% of tumors. In 44% of cases cathepsin D was detected in tumor stroma. A total of 63% of the tissue samples stained positive for cathepsin D (tumor and\/or stromal staining). In all cases the cathepsin D level was measured in tumor cytosol by radioimmunoassay. Cytosols were considered positive when cathepsin D concentrations of over 40 pmol\/mg cell protein were found. Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection of cathepsin D revealed a 76% concordance rate. Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation of cathepsin D expression with axillary node involvement; no correlation was found with tumor size, tumor grade, steroid receptor status or age of patients.

A sialo-odontogenic (glandular-odontogenic) cyst is likely to show aggressive growth, so that complete resection is essential.

We examined the correlation of the incidence in different cases and the topographical correspondence. CEA was detected by immunohistochemistry and HPV infection was diagnosed by in situ hybridization (including typing of 6\/11, 16\/18, 31\/33) and well-established histologic criteria. Samples from 32 women were examined. In 29 cases (91%) CEA was expressed, mainly in the superficial layer of the epithelium. Twenty-three tissue samples (72%) showed HPV infection. There was topographical correspondence of the two markers (mainly in superficial cell layers) but no correlation concerning the incidence of HPV infection or particular HPV subtypes. The highest prevalence of HPV was found in dysplasias of the large-cell reserve cell type.","2645":"","2646":"","2647":"Solid, hard microparticles, such as starch granules, pollen, cellulose particles, fibres and crystals, whose diameters are well into the micrometre range, are incorporated regularly and in considerable numbers from the digestive tract. Motor factors play an important part in the paracellular penetration of the epithelial cell layer. From the subepithelial region the microparticles are transported away via lymph and blood vessels. They can be detected in body fluids using simple methods: only a few minutes after oral administration they can be found in the peripheral blood-stream. We observed their passage into urine, bile, cerebrospinal fluid, the alveolar lumen, the peritoneal cavity, breast milk, and transplacentally into the fetal blood-stream. Since persorbed microparticles can embolise small vessels, this touches on microangiological problems, especially in the region of the CNS. The long-term deposit of embolising microparticles which consist of potential allergens or contaminants, or which are carriers of contaminants, is of immunological and environmental-technical importance. Numerous ready-made foodstuffs contain large quantities of microparticles capable of persorption.","2648":"","2649":"A 60-year-old woman had undergone surgery for ductal breast carcinoma. Six years after operation there was no local recurrence, but metastases were found in the liver, lungs and in a meningioma.","2650":"","2651":"","2652":"","2653":"","2654":"","2655":"","2656":"","2657":"Based on the light microscopical and immunocytochemical findings in two cases of pneumatosis intestinalis, a new theory is advanced on the morphogenesis of the cysts that can be observed in this disease. The cavities identifiable in both cases in the submucosa of the small intestine and of the colon, respectively, were partially lined by histiocytes and foreign-body giant cells. Most of the lumina found in the subserosa of the stomach, small intestine and colon had an identical aspect. In addition, there were numerous true cysts here with a narrow, single-layered cells seam, showing the immunocytochemical characteristics of the mesothelium, but not the capillary endothelia. Thus, contrary to previous assumptions, pneumatosis interstinalis apparently does not develop from cystic dilatation of gas-filled lymph vessels that shrink and disappear in the process of an inflammatory foreign body reaction. Rather, the disease initially seems to manifest itself through gas-filled pseudocysts partially bordered by histiocytes and foreign-body giant cells, which become secondarily mesothelialized in the subserosa. Lymph vessels would thus not have significance for the morphogenesis of this disease.","2658":"","2659":"The numbers of autopsies performed at the Institute of Pathology in Chemnitz before and after German unification (1990) were compared (1987-1992). In 1991 and 1992 a decrease of up to 40% was observed. In the former GDR an autopsy was possible without agreement of the relatives, whereas since unification the relatives have the power to forbid an autopsy. This was the principal reason for the dramatic decline in the past 2 years. Another relevant factor is the difficult economic situation of most hospitals in the region, preventing the arrangement of more autopsies. Analysis also shows the important role of physicians in clinics regarding the autopsy rates.","2660":"","2661":"","2662":"","2663":"Samples of a juxtaoral organ were examined immunohistochemically with antibodies against light-chain cytokeratin (KL-1), cytokeratin 19, desmin, chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein. The epithelial cells were found to be immunoreactive only with the two cytokeratin antibodies. Transmission electron microscopy was also performed. The results are best compatible with a mechanoreceptor function of the organ.","2664":"","2665":"Connatal heterotopies are rare accidental findings fore-most without clinical symptoms. The present case report describes an asymptomatic multilocular bronchial cyst of a 72 years old woman which occurred in the left ventricular endocard of the anterior papillary muscle and which was covered with ciliated and occasionally multilayered epithelium. Today the knowledge about these rare cardial heterotopies is important, because they are not only accidental postmortal findings but also the clinical importance is rising as consequence of the improved diagnostic imaging procedures with a high resolution. The histogenesis and the classification of cardial heterotopies is discussed.","2666":"","2667":"","2668":"","2669":"","2670":"","2671":"A sporadic case of idiopathic asymmetric heart hypertrophy in a newborn infant is reported. Despite drug therapy the baby died in progressive heart failure at 23 days of age. At necropsy there was cardiac hypertrophy with features similar to those of the usual asymmetric from observed in adults. On gross examination the myocardium of the ventricular septum and the free wall of the left ventricle showed a disorganized structure. Microscopically, the changes consisted of an abnormal arrangement of muscle cells and muscle bundles with areas of hypertrophied myofibers. In agreement with other authors myocardial disorganization (\"disarray\") is interpreted as a form of dysplasia, hypertrophy being a secondary phenomenon. The hypothesis that these abnormalities represent the persistence of the embryonic myocardial structure is discussed. The pathogenetic significance of focal myocardial dysplasias is apparently related to the amount of myocardium involved.","2672":"","2673":"","2674":"","2675":"","2676":"","2677":"The problems associated with lethal gas gangrene infections that arise in connection with medical treatment are described and discussed, based on our own observations and on cases reported in the literature. Special emphasis is placed on questions relating to causality and responsibility. The difficulties encountered in the evaluation of such \"iatrogenic\" gas gangrene infections are due to the fact that clostridia occur ubiquitously, i.e. that they also reside in the human organism, for instance on the skin. For this reason a positive bacteriological diagnosis of gas gangrene does not necessarily mean that a clinically relevant infection and\/or disease state is present at the same time. The implications for morphological practice arising from this situation are discussed, especially with regard to the significance of the intravital, agonal or postmortem bacteriological diagnosis of gas gangrene. Questions concerning the obligation to report such cases when encountered during forensic autopsies are also addressed.","2678":"","2679":"","2680":"","2681":"","2682":"","2683":"","2684":"","2685":"","2686":"","2687":"","2688":"","2689":"","2690":"","2691":"","2692":"","2693":"","2694":"","2695":"","2696":"","2697":"","2698":"","2699":"Myiasis is a rare disease in Europe and the USA; it is defined by the development of parasitic, mostly tropical maggots in the human body.

Normal, sexually mature breast showed an average lobular surface of 0.23 sq mm with an average acinar number of 29.6 (25-34).  Juvenile breast showed a smaller average lobular surface and less acini per lobule.  Lobular hyperplasia showed an increase in lobular surface mostly resulting from an increased number of acini, while in lobular secretion the increased lobular surface resulted from enlarged acinar surface caused by transformation of acini to alveoli.  The larger lobular surface in carcinoma in situ was likewise due to an increase in lobular surface due to enhanced epithelial proliferation causing an increase in acinar surface.  Morphological variants (apocrine and clear cell metaplasia; fibrous and lipomatous atrophy) without size or form modifications are also mentioned.
