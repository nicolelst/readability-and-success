Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health problem worldwide. Nonetheless, in rural areas and low-income countries, the problem may be more difficult to eradicate because there are stereotypes that reinforce negative attitudes toward women, which increase the severity of the problem. Goal: This article presents the development of \"Tsiunas,\" a videogame designed to increase GBV awareness. By implementing game situations that represent attitudes and beliefs that justify unequal and violent relationships between men and women, this videogame attempts to transform attitudes and thoughts entrenched in a patriarchal society model. Results: Tsiunas was evaluated in two phases to: (1) validate the usability and stability of the game and (2) validate the potential change in students' perception regarding GBV situations and recognition of co-responsible masculinities. Both evaluations were carried out through surveys. The results showed that students had a high level of acceptance and appropriation of the content and message of the videogame. Conclusions: The findings allowed to conclude that the game situations presented in Tsiunas influenced changes of opinion in men and women regarding entrenched beliefs about patriarchal patterns, tolerance levels of violence against women, and attitudes toward violence against women. Likewise, the videogame supported the recognition of co-responsible masculinities.","3":null,"4":"Objective: Gesture-based serious games can be based on playful and interactive scenarios to enhance user engagement and experience during exercises, thereby increasing efficiency in the motor rehabilitation process. This study aimed to develop the Rehabilite Game (RG) as a complementary therapy tool for upper limb rehabilitation in clinics and home environments and to evaluate aspects of usability and user experience of it. Materials and Methods: The evaluation consisted of the use of a gesture-based serious game with motor rehabilitation sessions managed in a web platform. Thirty-three participants were recruited (21 physiotherapists and 12 patients). The protocol allowed each participant to have the experience of playing sessions with different combinations of settings. The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) was used to evaluate aspects of usability and user experience. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Federal University of Piaui (number 3,429,494). Results: The level of satisfaction with the RG was positive, with an excellent Net Promoter Score for 85.7% of physiotherapists and 100% of patients. All six UEQ scales (attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty) reflected acceptance. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that, according to the results obtained in the experiments, the RG had positive feedback from physiotherapists and patients, indicating that the game can be used in a clinical trial to be compared with other rehabilitation techniques.","5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":"Objective: To verify if individuals' poststroke and healthy controls would improve their performance in reaction and movement times practicing a serious game task using the upper limb movements. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 30 individuals poststroke and 30 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. We used the \"Association Game for Rehabilitation\" (AGaR) where participants played by matching a pair of images whose meanings were similar. Hand movements were captured by a Kinect system and poststroke participants used their nonparetic upper limb. Reaction time and movement times (time to select an image and movement time to the target) were measured. Data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance. Results: Performance improved for both groups across all variables with better performance in movement times than reaction time only for poststroke individuals. Conclusions: Upper limb movements using nonimmersive serious games enhanced motor performance in reaction and movement times for healthy controls and individuals poststroke.

Spasticity management is important to accelerate motor recovery. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of training with robot-mediated virtual reality gaming on upper limb spasticity and motor functions in individuals with chronic stroke. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 Saudi individuals with chronic stroke were involved in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group received conventional physiotherapy and training with robot-mediated virtual reality gaming, and the control group received only conventional physiotherapy. Outcomes were measured by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), WMFT-Time, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Active Range of Motion (AROM) of multiple joints of the upper limb, and Handgrip Strength (HGS). The scores of all the outcome measures were recorded at baseline and after the completion of the treatment. Results: Individuals with stroke in the experimental group had a better improvement in most measured variables (AROM of shoulder abduction, elbow supination and wrist extension, WMFT-Time, HGS, ARAT, WMFT, and MAS) compared with the control group after the completion of the treatment. Both groups showed significant improvement in all the measured variables after completion of the treatment, except in MAS for wrist flexors in the control group. Conclusion: Training with robot-mediated virtual reality gaming was effective in modulating spasticity and improving the motor functions of the affected upper limbs in individuals with chronic stroke. This study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT05069480).","12":"Objective: Game-based interventions can easily disseminate health information to hard-to-reach populations, such as sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY; e.g., gay\/lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youth). SGMY disproportionately experience health problems, which have been attributed to greater violence victimization, such as bullying. Nevertheless, few interventions exist to improve health outcomes for bullied SGMY. Since game-based interventions offer economically viable and easily scalable solutions, we explored why bullied SGMY play games, the gaming characteristics they enjoy, and their preferences for future game-based interventions. Materials and Methods: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 20 14- to 18-year-old U.S.-residing bullied SGMY recruited from social media. We asked participants about their current gaming experiences, preferences, and suggestions for future games and then conducted thematic analysis. Results: The majority of SGMY reported playing games to experience positive feelings associated with higher degrees of agency. Through controlling in-game storyline and character customization settings, SGMY described feeling safe and engaged in game play. In addition, SGMY reported playing games as a distraction from the real world. Coping with stress and other negative emotions was a commonly reported motivation for playing games, as was gleaning happiness independent from stress management. Furthermore, SGMY mentioned using games to connect with people, both in-person and virtually, to develop and maintain friendships. Conclusion: This study highlights specific methods of tailoring games to the interests of bullied SGMY. In addition, our findings are preliminary indicators that SGMY may use games to achieve healthy psychosocial developmental milestones. This study may be integral in informing the development of future game-based interventions for SGMY.","13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":"Objectives: An empirical study is carried out based on Plague, Inc. to explore whether the game has raised awareness of public health and urged players to make a better choice about health. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six college students from 24 cities in 11 provinces of China were investigated for a week-long survey. According to grounded theory principles, we coded original records from 69 diary reports using qualitative analysis tools. Results: We constructed nine core categories from participants' journals and drew the mechanism chart of the game as a means of health communication. The results showed that participants had experienced (1) an iterative learning process based on the authenticity and multiperspective features of the game and obtained specific learning outcomes; (2) deep thinking through the association between the game and the real world. And we extracted variables that are highly predictive of behavior change, including cognition of seriousness, cognition of susceptibility, action clue, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, noncore categories (including emotions and gameplay) directly and indirectly impacted players' learning and behavior change. Conclusion: The study shows Plague, Inc. has played a positive role in health communication (mainly reflected in the improvement of players' cognitive level, the establishment of health belief, and behavior changes). Moreover, it is concluded that reflection plays an important role in health communication interventions. However, careful consideration should be given to the use of this game as a means of health intervention due to its limitations and certain deficiencies.","19":"Introduction: Loss aversion when using gamification is incompletely understood. The aim of this study was therefore to examine how participants alter their behavior vis-a-vis meeting a daily step goal based on the prospect of losing or gaining a gamification level. Methods: We enrolled 602 participants across four arms who were given pedometers. In the three experimental arms, participants began at the medium level and were allocated 70 points each week, losing 10 points each day they did not meet their step goal. Having at least 40 points at the end of the week resulted in a level increase, otherwise they lost a level. We fit a generalized estimating equation, clustered on participants, modeling step goal attainment on day 7. Our primary predictor was a categorical variable simultaneously indicating what level the participants began the week in and whether they had more than, less than, or exactly 40 points after 6 days. Results: Participants at risk of losing the highest level were 18.40% (confidence interval [95% CI]: 18.26-19.90) more likely to meet their step goal than those who had secured the highest level. Participants who could potentially move from the low to the medium level were 10.61% (95% CI: 9.98-11.24) more likely to meet their step goal than those in the Control group. Those in the Medium group were similarly more likely to achieve their step goal on day 7 (10.00%, 95% CI: 9.15-10.85) than those who had already secured an increase to the high level. Discussion: We find that participants in this trial generally exhibit loss aversion so long as the loss relates to something that was earned rather than endowed. This knowledge can be incorporated in future interventions using gamification by requiring participants to earn all levels as they progress.

For this purpose, it seems necessary to make available the best scientific information concerning the feasibility and potential benefits of playing videogames within this population. This study aimed to systematically review the existing scientific evidence regarding the effects of videogaming on the physical and mental health of people with ID. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a literature search was performed using MEDLINE\/PubMed, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus up to June 2020. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to rate the methodological quality of the included investigations. A total of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected. Data synthesis examined physical health, including anthropometrics, physical fitness, and motor skills, and mental health and cognitive function. Intervention protocols were based on videogames of different nature (i.e., exergames and computerized cognitive training) and showed substantial heterogeneity in duration. Session length varied from 15 to 60 minutes. Five studies achieved a high intervention adherence rate, whereas a low drop-out rate was reported in eight RCTs. Videogaming is a useful therapy for improving physical and cognitive function in people with ID. Exergaming seems to be an interesting physical intervention for increasing fitness and motor skill levels, while sedentary videogaming has shown potential for stimulating cognitive function. Further research to analyze its feasibility and its impact on body composition and mental health is needed.","29":null,"30":"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the following: (1) the level of physical activity (PA) achieved during commercial active virtual reality (VR) games, and (2) which active VR games elicit higher enjoyment levels in young, healthy adults. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six participants completed four study sessions, each devoted to playing one of the following head-mounted display VR games for 15 minutes: Beat Saber (BS), Holopoint (HP), Hot Squat (HS), and Relax Walk VR. PA intensity measures included percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and accelerometry. Enjoyment was measured with the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) following each gaming session. Mixed-model analysis of variances were used to analyze the outcome measures. Results: The analyses showed that HS elicited significantly higher %HRR and RPE than BS, HP, and Relax Walk. HS was the only game to reach moderate intensity via %HRR. Accelerometer data showed that time in whole-body moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for HS was significantly greater than HP, which was greater than BS and Relax Walk. Also, males exhibited significantly more whole-body and upper limb MVPA compared with females during gameplay. BS and HP were rated significantly more enjoyable than HS and Relax Walk. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that active VR games can elicit varying degrees of PA intensity levels in young healthy adults, with HS eliciting moderate intensity activity. The games rated highest in enjoyment required mostly arm movement and a perceived light exertion.

Materials and Methods: This study performed a secondary analysis of data from the ninth analysis of the \"Game User Panel\" data published by the Korean Creative Content Agency. In addition, an analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey test was conducted to examine the differences in mental health, academic achievement, and quality of life according to game-use type. This was a retrospective study using secondary deidentified data. Results: Among the total respondents, 39.5% of adolescents were classified as general game users (GGUs), 11.3% as adaptive game users (AGUs), 11.2% as maladaptive game users (MGUs), and 38.0% as twofold game users (TGUs). GGUs had the lowest scores for depression and anxiety, followed by higher scores in AGUs, TGUs, and MGUs. In addition, GGUs scored higher on quality of life than the other groups while the AGUs had higher scores on academic achievement than other groups. Conclusion: Adolescents experience both adaptive and maladaptive use, and experiencing only adaptive use without maladaptive use has been shown to be relatively infrequent. Therefore, education about online game use for adolescents should not be uniformly provided given the psychological characteristics of each group; instead, it should be customized based on game user type.","35":null,"36":"","37":"Objective: Serious videogames and virtual reality (VR) have gained increasing interest for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \"The Secret Trail of Moon\" (TSTM) study is a clinical trial devoted to testing the efficacy of TSTM, a VR serious videogame developed to train in five major cognitive skills usually compromised in patients with ADHD. This study is a three-arm nonequality trial comparing TSTM to online chess training and a control group (CG). This study aims to demonstrate that augmentation with either TSTM or online chess is efficacious in clinically drug-stable patients with ADHD. Materials and Methods: This study is prospective, unicentric, and randomized with a CG. One hundred five patients with ADHD, ages 12-22 years old, and pharmacologically stable were enrolled. Patients were randomized into three groups: TSTM group, online chess group (therapeutic chess [TC]), and CG. Objective and subjective measures of the patient and parents are included. Patient visits differ for each group. TSTM group patients have 15 face-to-face visits: preinclusion visit, inclusion visit, 12 training visits, and final visit. TC and CG patients have 3 face-to-face visits (preinclusion, initial visit, and final visit) and 12 e-mail or phone communications during training (TC) or follow-up (CG group). This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB). Results: Not applicable. This is a study protocol.

Materials and Methods: Participants were randomized to one of three groups: one group played an off-the-shelf videogame (i.e., CT), the second group engaged in a computerized training program focused on fast perceptual comparisons, visuospatial working memory, rapid scanning of a visual array and pattern recognition, visual discrimination, and selective and divided attention and processing speed (i.e., InSight), and the third (control) group received no training. Training in the two intervention conditions consisted of 60 training sessions of 1 hour each, which were completed in 3 months (5 hours a week). As part of a larger study, participants received mental rotation testing, which was administered immediately before (baseline), after (post-test), and 3 months after (follow-up) training. Results: Although the InSight group showed greater improvements in rotation rate at the immediate post-test, by the 3-month follow-up, the combined treatment groups (CT and InSight) had improved more than controls. Conclusion: The improvements in mental rotation performance found at 3-month follow-up add additional support to previous research, showing visuospatial benefits of both videogame play and cognitive training in older adults. Common elements of both interventions may include expansion of the attentional field of view and faster visual comparison efficiency.","42":null,"43":null,"44":"Objective: To explore changes in task\/scheduling self-efficacy in children with visual impairments after playing exergames, using the participatory design (PD) method to guide students with visual impairments to engage in the design and test of exergames. Materials and Methods: A pre-\/post-test was used with two experimental groups (nine high school students with visual impairments aged 18-21, nine junior high school students with visual impairments aged 14-17). Data were analyzed by an independent-\/paired-sample t-test to assess changes in task\/scheduling self-efficacy of different groups after gameplay. Data of three dimensions (psychological emotion, physical activity, and social interaction) were collected through texts, participative observations, live notetaking, and video recordings. These dimensions provide opportunities for children with visual impairments to improve their self-efficacy. Results: Exergames helped children with visual impairments to improve their task and scheduling self-efficacy. It confirmed that exergames can be useful to promote their psychological emotion, enhance levels of positive physical activity, and increase social opportunities to improve self-efficacy. Conclusion: Participants of various ages who engaged in exergames reported an improvement in both task and scheduling self-efficacy in terms of psychological emotion, physical activity, and social interaction. The PD approach may be useful in the design of products for people with visual impairments and may ultimately be helpful in supporting the social and physical needs of people with disabilities.","45":null,"46":"Objective: Applied games are considered a promising approach to deliver mental health interventions. Nonspecific factors such as expectations and motivation may be crucial to optimize effectiveness yet have not been examined so far. The current study examined the effect of expectations for improvement on (1) experienced fun and positive affect, and (2) in-game play behaviors while playing MindLight, an applied game shown to reduce anxiety. The secondary aim was to examine the moderating role of symptom severity and motivation to change. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven participants (47 females; 17-21 years old) preselected on anxiety symptoms viewed a trailer in which MindLight was promoted as either a mental health or an entertainment game. These trailers were used to induce different expectations in participants. Participants subsequently played the game for 60 minutes. Before playing, participants filled out questionnaires about their general anxiety symptoms, motivation to change, state anxiety, affect, and arousal. While playing, in-game behaviors and galvanic skin response (GSR) were recorded continuously. After playing, state anxiety, affect, and arousal were measured again as well as experienced fun. Results: Participants in both trailer conditions showed increases in state anxiety, arousal, and GSR. Expectations did not influence experienced fun and positive affect, nor in-game behaviors. In addition, no moderation effects of motivation to change and symptom severity were found. Conclusion: Experiences and engagement with MindLight were not influenced by expectations, motivation to change, and symptom severity. For future research, it is recommended to examine individual differences in these effects, and long-term and more distal outcomes and processes.","47":"Objective: In recent years, there has been an increase in research on the therapeutic effects of exergaming, but there have been few studies on these types of interventions for chronic low back pain. In this study, we hypothesized that the Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (RFA) exergame would be effective for patients with chronic low back pain, and we conducted a randomized prospective longitudinal study. Materials and Methods: Patients with chronic low back pain were included in this study. Twenty randomly selected patients (9 males and 11 females, mean age 49.3 years) were included in the RFA group, and RFA exergaming was performed once a week for 40 minutes for 8 weeks. Twenty patients (12 males and 8 females, mean age 55.60 years) served as the control group and received oral treatment for 8 weeks. Pain and psychological scores (pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia) were measured and analyzed before and after 8 weeks of treatment in both groups. Results: In the RFA group, low back pain, buttock pain, and pain self-efficacy were significantly improved after 8 weeks of RFA exergaming, but there was no significant improvement in lower limb numbness, pain catastrophizing, or kinesiophobia. In the control group, no significant improvement was observed after 8 weeks of oral treatment. Conclusion: RFA exergaming increased pain self-efficacy and reduced pain in patients with chronic low back pain. Future treatment protocols should be developed to improve pain self-efficacy.

New technologies from the fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) could help to increase the motivation of older people and positively influence their health behavior. To be able to respond specifically to the needs and expectations when developing an exergame for seniors with hypertension, the aim of this study was to determine the requirements for movement training within an intelligent AR system. Materials and Methods: Eleven seniors aged 65 years or older with essential hypertension and five experts from the cardiological field were interviewed using a semistructured interview and were examined with a task-based approach. In the task-based application, both VR and AR demos were used. Results: The results presented in this article refer to requirements for the development of a movement training within an exergame for older adults with hypertension. We found that on the one hand, group effects and, on the other, natural environments have a high motivational character. Furthermore, communication and interaction represent a decisive criterion for participation during exercises. Regarding the training concept the experts, in particular, recommended endurance-related activities. In addition, vital data and performance monitoring should be used to evaluate success, to signal warnings and to provide additional motivation.

The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO and carried out in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. Results: The search of PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases identified a total of 333 records. After adjusting for duplicates and other inclusion criteria, 69 studies were selected for inclusion in the review. We found that authors used a wide range of dedicated questionnaires and, in about 50% of studies, a few validated tools to assess motivation and satisfaction during technology-assisted rehabilitation. The instruments most used were the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0), and the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use (USE) scale. Motivation and satisfaction were generally portrayed as multidimensional concepts; overall, 29 domains were assessed by 9 different tools. Conclusion: The tools used in the current literature to assess patient motivation and satisfaction during technology-assisted rehabilitation are quite variegated, but we would recommend use of the IMI and USE questionnaires based on their widespread diffusion. However, the choice of domains explored and number of items calls for harmonization.

Findings from each study that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed and summarized into emergent themes to determine the impact of digital games in promoting healthy behaviors and benefits among these older adults. Materials and Methods: Five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar) were searched for studies that evaluated interventions of videogames for older adults aged 65 and older. The initial search yielded 806 articles. After evaluating them against the inclusion criteria, 23 studies remained. Results: Out of the 23 studies we reviewed, 20 reported the significant impact of videogame interventions on the elderly's physical health. In addition, 14 studies reported effects on the elderly's mental health. Exergame is the most popular type of game used in these videogame-based interventions. This review also includes the details of study design (e.g., type of intervention, length, frequency), population sample, and measurements used in the studies. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrates that videogame-based interventions are helpful in promoting physical health (i.e., balance, mobility, strength, physical fitness, and walking performance\/gait parameters) and mental health (i.e., balance confidence, executive functions, reaction time, and processing speed) among older adults.

Articles were retrieved from the databases CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO, and Medline. Studies were included in the review if they involved a physical activity\/videogame intervention and measured outcomes of depressive symptoms in older adults. The search generated 957 articles for consideration, which were narrowed to 17 articles after applying exclusion criteria. In studies that required depressive symptoms as an inclusion criterion, there was an improvement in depressive symptoms in older adults following the exergame intervention. In studies that did not require depressive symptoms as an inclusion criterion, researchers found mixed results. Future older adult exergame research should measure depression as a primary outcome, utilize control groups with random sampling, consist of larger sample sizes, and include people with disabilities.","80":"Objective: Muscle weakness is an important risk factor for falls in older adults. Intensity and duration of muscle activity are important determinants of exercise effectiveness in combating muscle weakness. The aim of this article was to assess the intensity and duration of muscle activity in virtual reality (VR) balance games. Materials and Methods: Thirty young and 30 healthy older adults played seven different VR balance games. Muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, soleus, and gluteus medius was obtained using surface electromyography (EMG). The processed EMG signals were divided into 200-ms blocks, after which each block was categorized by its average normalized EMG activity, that is, &gt;80%, 60%-80%, 40%-60%, or &lt;40% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). We calculated the total number of blocks in each category to score intensity, as well as the maximal number of consecutive 200-ms blocks (MCBs) &gt;40% MVC, to identify prolonged muscle activity. Results: Muscle activity during game play was mostly &lt;40% MVC and prolonged activation was lacking. Only the games that included more dynamic movements showed activation blocks of higher intensity and resulted in more MCBs. Conclusion: Our method allowed us to analyze the overall muscle activity and the distribution of activity over a trial. Although the activation levels during these VR games were low in general, we identified game elements that could potentially provide a strength training stimulus. Future research should aim to implement these elements, such that the intensity, prolonged activity, and rest are optimized to sufficiently challenge lower limb muscles in VR training.","81":null,"82":"Objective: We examine the extent that videogame avatars provide players with opportunities for identity exploration, aiming to test the findings of self-discrepancy theory research on the user\/avatar relationship with novel cognitive anthropological methods. Specifically, we examine if avatar traits are idealized (more representative of players' ideal rather than actual self) or actualized (more representative of players' actual self) as a function of players' self-esteem. Materials and Methods: Utilizing cognitive anthropological methods, we examine the relationship between actual, avatar, and ideal selves. We first asked 21 respondents to list traits they associated with their various selves. We then asked 57 new respondents to perform four pile sorts of the salient items from these lists (1 unconstrained sort of like-traits, and 3 sorts of terms indicative of respondents' ideal\/actual\/avatar self). Analysis of this \"free list\" and \"pile sort\" data allowed us to clarify (in a manner sensitive to gamer culture) relationships between respondents' various conceptions of self, including how those relationships were modified by self-esteem. Illustrative quotes from the interviews further clarified these relationships. Results: Paired t-test analysis shows that informants as a whole describe their avatar compared with actual selves with fewer negative terms (idealization). Low-esteem players actualize what they deem as positive traits onto their avatars, while simultaneously idealizing avatars' negative traits by minimizing them. Compared with low-esteem gamers, high-esteem players associate significantly more positive attributes with all their various selves-actual, avatar, and ideal-while describing avatar compared with actual selves with fewer positive terms and comparable numbers of negative terms (the latter a process of actualization). Conclusion: Results point to the necessity of theoretical accounts that recognize that avatars may reflect a complex relationship with the user's actual and ideal self, without assuming that avatar play frees gamers from offline social, psychological, or bodily constraints.","83":null,"84":null,"85":"Background: India has a diverse cultural heritage, with a wealth of indigenous folk games that are culturally ingrained.

With the rise in smartphone use and digital game playing among older adults, digital tools such as sensor-controlled digital games (SCDGs) can offer accessible health-promoting tools that are enjoyable and easy to use. However, designing SCDGs that are compelling and aligned with their life values and self-management needs can be challenging. This article describes a qualitative study with older adults with HF who were recruited from a cardiac rehabilitation laboratory in central Texas to identify their perceptions and expectations regarding a SCDG for HF self-management. Materials and Methods: A low-fidelity prototype that demonstrated the features of a SCDG was used to obtain the participants' perceptions about the value of SCDGs for HF self-management with respect to content, customization, flexibility, and usability through qualitative interviews. Results: We interviewed 15 patients with HF (53% women; age range, 53-90 years; 60% white). The concept of SCDGs for HF self-management was highly acceptable (80%). Participants provided suggestions for game characters, progress in the game, and game notifications and incentives. Perceived benefits included helping users track their behaviors and establish routines, become informed on strategies to manage HF, and empower themselves to take charge of their health. Conclusions: The study's findings will guide personalization of SCDG development to motivate patient engagement in HF self-management behaviors.","91":null,"92":"Background: Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading cause of death globally. It is now well established that a sedentary lifestyle is a unique risk factor for several diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which account for about 30% of global mortality. Diabetes is a major preventable cause of costly and debilitating renal failure, heart disease, lower limb amputation, and avoidable blindness. In recent years, the idea of using interactive computing systems that leverage gamification to promote physical activity has been widely researched. Prior studies have shown that exergames, that is those that encourage physical activity, can increase enjoyment and intrinsic motivation compared with conventional exercises; as such, they can be effective in promoting physical and mental health. There has been some research on immersive virtual reality (VR) exergames; however, to the best of our knowledge, it is limited and preliminary. This work aims at filling the gap and investigates the effect of display type (DT) and viewing perspective (VP) on players' exertion, engagement, and overall game experience in immersive VR exergames. Objective: This article aims at examining whether DT and VP can affect gameplay performance, players' exertion, game experience, cybersickness, and electroencephalography (EEG) engagement index when playing a gesture-based (i.e., body motion) exergame. Materials and Methods: Study 1 employed a one-way between-subjects design with 24 participants equally distributed in two groups (immersive VR and 50-inch TV) to perform 12 pre-defined gestures. The main outcome measures were National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) workload for each group as well as 7 Likert scale and EEG engagement index for each gesture. Study 2 included 16 participants in playing a game with the gestures selected from study 1. All participants played 4 versions based on combinations of DT (immersive VR and 50-inch TV) and VP (first-person and third-person) to assess exertion (%HRmax, calories consumption, and Borg RPE 6-20), game experience, cybersickness, and EEG engagement index. Results: Study 1 results showed that DT had no effect on the ratings of the gestures, NASA-TLX workload, and EEG engagement index. Study 2 results showed that immersive VR not only resulted in a significantly higher exertion (%HRmax, calories consumption, and Borg RPE) but also helped achieve better positive game experience in challenge, flow, sensory and imaginative immersion, as well as lower negative affect. We also found that nausea and oculomotor were significantly higher in immersive VR. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that youth who played gesture-based exergame in immersive VR had a higher level of exertion (%HRmax, calories consumption, and Borg RPE), although the number of performed gestures were not significantly different. They also felt that immersive VR was much more challenging, immersive (flow, sensory and imaginative immersion), and had a lower negative affect than a 50-inch TV; however, immersive VR was more likely to make youth have higher cybersickness.","93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":"Objective: Differences in cultural background between health providers and patients can reduce effective access to health services in multicultural settings. Health sciences educators have recently suggested that game-based learning may be effective for cross-cultural care training. This scoping review maps published knowledge on educational games intended to foster cross-cultural care training and highlights the research gaps for future research. Materials and Methods: A scoping review searched PubMed, Eric, Embase, Lilacs, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for theoretical and empirical research, using terms relevant to cross-cultural care and game-based learning. A participatory research framework engaged senior medical students and participatory research experts in conducting and evaluating the review. Results: Forty-one documents met the inclusion criteria, all from developed countries. The most common source of publication was nursing and medicine (39%; 16\/41) and used the cultural competence approach (44%; 18\/41). Around one-half of the publications (51%; 21\/41) were theoretical and 39% (16\/41) were empirical. Empirical studies most commonly used mixed methods (44%; 7\/16), followed by strictly quantitative (31%; 5\/16) or qualitative (25%; 4\/16) approaches. There were no randomized controlled trials and only one study engaged end-users in the design. Empirical studies most frequently assessed role-play-related games (44%; 7\/16) and used game evaluation-related outcomes or learning-related outcomes. None used patient-oriented outcomes. Findings suggest that educational games are an effective and engaging educational intervention for cross-cultural care training. Conclusions: The paucity of studies on educational games and cross-cultural care training precludes a systematic review. Future empirical studies should focus on randomized counterfactual designs and patient-related outcomes. We encourage involving end-users in developing content for educational games.","98":"Because of rapid evolution in exergaming technology and content, the literature on the benefits of exergaming needs ongoing review. Updated syntheses incorporating high-quality critical assessments of included articles can provide cutting-edge evidence to drive research and practice. The objectives were to summarize evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the association between exergaming and (1) physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior and energy expenditure (EE); and (2) body composition, body mass index (BMI), and other weight-related outcomes among persons younger than 30 years; and to summarize recommendations in the articles retained. The Elton B. Stephens Co. (ESBSCO) database for reviews was searched from January 1995 to July 2019. Data on study characteristics, findings, and recommendations for future research, game design, and intervention development were extracted from articles that met the inclusion criteria, quality scores were attributed to each article, and a narrative overview of the evidence was undertaken. Twenty-eight reviews, with 5-100 articles per review, were identified. Seventeen assessed the evidence on the association between exergaming and PA, EE, and\/or sedentary behavior, and 11 examined the association with body composition, BMI, or other weight-related outcomes. There was substantial heterogeneity across reviews in objectives, definitions, and methods. A positive relationship between exergaming and EE is well documented, but whether exergaming increases PA or changes body composition is not established. The reviews retained also provide evidence that exergaming is a healthier alternative to sedentary behavior and that it can be an exciting enjoyable pastime for youth, which adds variety in PA options for health and dietary interventions. Exergaming is likely more physically health promoting than traditional videogames because of higher EE and possibly improved physical fitness and body composition. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess if exergaming reduces sedentary time, has other health benefits, or is a sustainable behavior. We recommend that exergaming interventions be designed using behavior change theory, and that future reviews use standard review criteria and include recommendations for research, game design, and intervention development.","99":"Objective: Games for heath can take the form of interactive narratives, or stories in which readers have the option to make decisions about the direction of the plot. Individual differences may affect the extent to which individuals become engaged in such narratives. Materials and Methods: In two studies, we randomly assigned participants to read either a traditional linear narrative or an interactive version of the same narrative. We examined the influence of need for cognition (NFC) and transportability (the extent to which individuals tend to become immersed in narratives) on transportation, character identification, and perceived realism. Results: Transportability led to higher perceptions of realism in the interactive narrative in Study 1, but this effect was not replicated in Study 2. In Study 1, higher NFC led to greater identification in the interactive narrative; in Study 2, higher NFC led to greater transportation into the interactive narrative. Conclusion: Greater willingness to exert mental effort may lead to greater immersion in interactive narratives.","100":"User engagement in digital (serious) games may be important to increase their effectiveness. Insights into how to create engaging games for healthy lifestyle promotion are needed, as despite their potential, not all digital (serious) games are highly engaging. This study systematically reviewed game features that were associated with higher user engagement among youth. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycARTICLES databases. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included, if they documented game features associated with youth engagement. Coding of game features was performed using the mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics (MDA) framework. A total of 60 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the registered systematic review (No. CRD42018099487). Results showed that various game features were associated with user engagement in digital (serious) games: an attractive storyline, adaptable to gender and age, including diverse (antagonist) characters the user may identify with, high-end realistic graphics, well-defined instructions, which can be skipped, in combination with clear feedback and a balance of educational and fun content.

The effects have been mostly small or nonexistent. This narrative review analyzed the structural elements of the nutrition messages most likely related to effectiveness. Elements examined included the following: source, similarity of source to the participant, reference group, identification with or evaluative significance of the reference group, delivery, salience, background, tailoring, gain-loss framing, and whether an assessment of the group norm was conducted before designing the descriptive norm message. Most studies incorporated few of the reviewed structural elements, and message manipulations appeared weak. Controlled, systematic studies are needed to examine the effect of the structural elements, singly and in combination, on behavior and its mediators. Videogames are designed to be delivered in the same way to players; therefore, they offer a controlled environment for extensively and systematically manipulating structural elements of messages and examining the resulting behavioral effects. How this might be accomplished was described. Experimental research was identified as being necessary to delineate the individual and combined element effects, thereby contributing to the body of literature on videogame design and effectiveness.","102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":null,"108":"Objective: This article describes the findings of a study examining the ability of persons with strokes to use home virtual rehabilitation system (HoVRS), a home-based rehabilitation system, and the impact of motivational enhancement techniques on subjects' motivation, adherence, and motor function improvements subsequent to a 3-month training program. Materials and Methods: HoVRS integrates a Leap Motion controller, a passive arm support, and a suite of custom-designed hand rehabilitation simulations. For this study, we developed a library of three simulations, which include activities such as flexing and extending fingers to move a car, flying a plane with wrist movement, and controlling an avatar running in a maze using reaching movements. Two groups of subjects, the enhanced motivation (EM) group and the unenhanced control (UC) group, used the system for 12 weeks in their homes. The EM group trained using three simulations that provided 8-12 levels of difficulty and complexity. Graphics and scoring opportunities increased at each new level. The UC group performed the same simulations, but difficulty was increased utilizing an algorithm that increased difficulty incrementally, making adjustments imperceptible. Results: Adherence to both the EM and UC protocols exceeded adherence to home exercise programs described in the stroke rehabilitation literature. Both groups demonstrated improvements in upper extremity function. Intrinsic motivation levels were better for the EM group and motivation levels were maintained for the 12-week protocol. Conclusion: A 12-week home-based training program using HoVRS was feasible. Motivational enhancement may have a positive impact on motivation, adherence, and motor outcome.","109":"Objective: An estimated 100 million Americans have diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, a high risk of being diagnosed with diabetes, or prediabetes. Many complications can arise if diabetes is poorly managed. Hence, the need for adequate knowledge, skills, and ability to care for oneself, known as diabetes self-care management, is needed to reduce complication rates. We used an interactive platform that incorporates principles of gamification to enhance user engagement to enhance diabetes knowledge. The purpose of this descriptive pilot study was to discover what adult patients with diabetes thought about this novel educational approach to diabetes education. Materials and Methods: We collected focus group data from participants at a diabetes clinic after they played an interactive diabetes trivia game, on our software platform (Kaizen Education). Transcripts were coded and common themes were identified. Results: We conducted 9 focus groups that included 33 adult (age &gt;18) participants who had diabetes. An overarching theme of play\/gaming as a form of learning was apparent, and after analyzing the coding several themes emerged, including preferences and desired environments (clinic and home) for learning, desired players (including family, significant others), and a good balance of question difficulty. Conclusions: Participants were overwhelmingly positive about gamified education and felt empowered to lead discussions with their health care providers about diabetes self-care education, in a sense \"flipping\" the traditional clinic patient education paradigm. These results suggested that a flipped clinic approach could be beneficial, empowering, and engaging for patients.","110":null,"111":"Introduction: Research has demonstrated that videogame programs can be an effective intervention targeting social challenges among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Conclusion: Incorporating these elements during development of videogame programs can help enhance the outcomes for children with ASD. By including stakeholders' voices, it is assumed that the developed videogame programs may serve as user-friendly and engaging tools to potentially complement traditional interventions when overcoming social difficulties in individuals with ASD.","112":null,"113":null,"114":null,"115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":null,"119":null,"120":"Background: Currently, exergames are used by different age groups for both recreational and training\/rehabilitation purposes. However, little is known about how to design exergames so that they are motivating for specific age groups and health outcomes. Objective: In this article, we compare motivational factors between healthy young and older adults by analyzing their assessments of the same balance training exergame. Materials and Methods: We performed a laboratory-based assessment of a custom-made balance training exergame with 12 healthy young and 10 healthy older adults. Their answers to a semistructured text input questionnaire were analyzed qualitatively. Results: Both age groups were motivated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. We found that the young adults tended to be motivated by the game challenge and the in-game reward system (scores). In contrast, the older adults were more motivated by the perceived health effects (both physical and cognitive) and the joy of playing, with less regard for the in-game rewards. Conclusion: The differences in motivational factors that were identified between young and older adults have several design implications. For older adults less effort can be put on designing the in-game reward system and more on showing the player the potential health effects of their play. Furthermore, the competition aspect can be downplayed and more focus placed on simply making the gaming experience itself as joyful as possible.","121":"Introduction: Millions of people suffer from obstructive respiratory conditions globally. Including videogames in rehabilitation programs can be an interesting alternative to traditional programs or a complementary activity. Objective: To explore the use of videogames in the treatment of patients with obstructive respiratory diseases. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of videogames on health outcomes in patients with respiratory obstructive diseases. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. The methodological quality of the studies included was assessed with the Downs and Black quality assessment method. Results: Nine articles were included, of which three used videogames as physical training methods and managed to improve exercise capacity, strength, quality of life, and symptoms. The remaining six articles used videogames to educate patients about the disease and showed slight improvements in knowledge of the disease and use of medication. Conclusion: The results of this review show that videogames are a very useful complementary therapy. They can contribute to enhance rehabilitation programs, as they improve exercise capacity, muscle strength, quality of life, severity, control, and knowledge of the disease. Videogames should be supervised by a professional so that programs can be tailored to patients, proposing different activities in the game and controlling the correct performance, and generating an increase in adherence to treatment.

These challenges are often due to the lack of knowledge of seniors' game preferences and technology literacy as well as a poor involvement of the target population in the design process. Objective: This research aims at describing a detailed and scrutinized use case of applying human-centered design methodologies in the gamification of fitness training routines and illustrates how to incorporate seniors' feedback in the game design pipeline. Materials and Methods: We focus on how to use the insights from human-centered inquiries to improve in-game elements, such as mechanics or esthetics, and how to iterate the game design process based on playtesting sessions in the field. Results: We present a set of four Exergames created to train the critical functional fitness areas of older adults. We show how through rapid prototyping methods and multidisciplinary research, Exergames can be rigorously designed and developed to match individual physical capabilities. Moreover, we propose a set of guidelines for the design of context-aware Exergames based on the lessons learned. Conclusion: We highlight the process followed; it depicts 19 weeks of various activities delivering particular and actionable items that can be used as a checklist for future games for health design projects.","124":"Objective: In this intervention study, we investigated the benefits of nonaction videogames on measures of selective attention and visuospatial working memory (WM) in young adults. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight young adults were randomly assigned to the experimental group or to the active control group. The experimental group played 10 nonaction adaptive videogames selected from Lumosity, whereas the active control group played two nonadaptive simulation-strategy games (SimCity and The Sims). Participants in both groups completed 15 training sessions of 30 minutes each. The training was conducted in small groups. All the participants were tested individually before and after training to assess possible transfer effects to selective attention, using a Cross-modal Oddball task, inhibition with the Stroop task, and visuospatial WM enhancements with the Corsi blocks task. Results: Participants improved videogame performance across the training sessions. The results of the transfer tasks show that the two groups benefited similarly from game training. They were less distracted and improved visuospatial WM. Conclusion: Overall, there was no significant interaction between group (group trained with adaptive nonaction videogames and the active control group that played simulation games) and session (pre- and post-assessment). As we did not have a passive nonintervention control group, we cannot conclude that adaptive nonaction videogames had a positive effect, because some external factors might account for the pre- and post-test improvements observed in both groups.","125":null,"126":"Objective: The goal of this contribution is to develop a classifier able to determine if cybersickness (CS) has occurred after immersion in a virtual reality (VR) scenario, based on a combination of biosignals and game parameters. Methods: We collected electrocardiographic, electrooculographic, respiratory, and skin conductivity data from a total of 66 participants. In addition, we also captured relevant game parameters such as avatar linear and angular speed as well as acceleration, head movements, and on-screen collisions. The data were collected while the participants were in a 10-minute VR experience, which was developed in Unity. The experience forced rotation and lateral movements upon the participants to provoke CS. A baseline was captured during a first simple scenario. The data were then split in per-level, per-60-second, and per-30-second windows. Furthermore, participants filled a pre- and postimmersion simulator sickness questionnaire. Simulator sickness scores were then used as a reference for binary (CS vs. no CS) and ternary (no CS-mild CS-severe CS) classification patterns. Several classification methods (support vector machines, K-nearest neighbors, and neural networks) were tested. Results: A maximum classification accuracy of 82% was achieved for binary classification and 56% for ternary classification. Conclusion: Given the sample size and the variety of movement patterns presented in the demonstration, we conclude that a combination of biosignals and game parameters suffice to determine the occurrence of CS. However, substantial further research is required to improve binary classification accuracy to adequate values for real-life scenarios and to determine better approaches to classify its severity.","127":"This systematic review aims to analyze the state-of-the-art regarding interaction modalities used on serious games for upper limb rehabilitation. A systematic search was performed in IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases. PRISMA and QualSyst protocols were used to filter and assess the articles. Articles must meet the following inclusion criteria: they must be written in English; be at least four pages in length; use or develop serious games; focus on upper limb rehabilitation; and be published between 2007 and 2017. Of 121 articles initially retrieved, 33 articles met the inclusion criteria. Three interaction modalities were found: vision systems (42.4%), complementary vision systems (30.3%), and no-vision systems (27.2%). Vision systems and no-vision systems obtained a similar mean QualSyst (86%) followed by complementary vision systems (85.7%). Almost half of the studies used vision systems as the interaction modality (42.4%) and used the Kinect sensor to collect the body movements (48.48%). The shoulder was the most treated body part in the studies (19%). A key limitation of vision systems and complementary vision systems is that their device performances might be affected by lighting conditions. A main limitation of the no-vision systems is that the range-of-motion in angles of the body movement might not be measured accurately. Due to a limited number of studies, fruitful areas for further research could be the following: serious games focused on finger rehabilitation and trauma injuries, game difficulty adaptation based on user's muscle strength and posture, and multisensor data fusion on interaction modalities.","128":null,"129":"Objective: To carry out and investigate the effectiveness of an emotional intelligence (EI) training based on the EI ability model, using videogames as experience-based learning tools to increase EI abilities in adolescents. Materials and Methods: A pre-\/post-test\/follow-up quasi-experimental design was used with an experimental and a control group (121 adolescents, 15.7% boys, mean age of 14.1 years). The training called \"EmotivaMente\" consisted of eight sessions lasting 1.5 hours each, conducted with six first-year classes of two Italian senior high schools. Data on emotional competences were collected at baseline, at the end of the training and 3 months later. Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Students who participated in the EI training reported an improvement in the evaluation and expression of emotions in relation to the self (own emotions) compared with the control group, immediately after the training, but this difference did not persist at the follow-up (3 months later). Furthermore, EmotivaMente found an increase in the use of cognitive revaluation as a strategy of emotion regulation in the experimental group over time. Conclusions: EmotivaMente helped adolescents to improve emotional skills. Results confirmed that videogames can be useful to promote EI in adolescents at school, if integrated with a guided and assisted framework. Implication of the findings and recommendations for future research are made.","130":null,"131":null,"132":null,"133":"Objective: Assessment of the pedagogical effect and technological acceptance of the serious game, CODIFICO, which has been designed to train medical students in ICD-10 diagnosis coding. Materials and Methods: We designed the serious game, CODIFICO, as an alternative way to teach ICD-10 diagnosis coding to undergraduate medical students. To assess the pedagogical effect of the game, we used the quasiexperimental pretest-posttest design. The participants began by completing a knowledge pretest on Blackboard. After the pretest, the teacher presented the game to the students and invited them to play it for 1 week. Then, the students completed the posttest on Blackboard. We applied the Wilcoxon test to establish the difference between the pretest and posttest. We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the participants' technology acceptance toward the game. Results: Sixty-one undergraduate medical students from a large Colombian private university took part. There was no statistically significant difference between the pretest and the posttest. However, the game had some positive effects on knowledge. The game was well accepted among the participants. Conclusion: The game, CODIFICO, was useful to teach diagnosis determination, not diagnostic coding. Some of the reasons that caused this situation were insufficient attention to the pedagogical theory, excessive reliance on clinical aspects of the medical training, limited resources, and lack of experience at the medical school to design gamification strategies.","134":"","135":null,"136":"Objective: A large number of children report fear and distress when undergoing blood work and intravenous placement. In pediatric departments, Child Life interventions are considered to be the gold standard in nonmedical pain management techniques. Virtual reality (VR) has also been identified as an effective tool for pain distraction in children undergoing painful medical procedures. The aim of this study was to document the efficacy of VR as a mode of distraction during a medical procedure compared with two comparison conditions: watching television (TV, minimal control condition) and distraction provided by the Child Life (CL, gold standard control condition) program. Materials and Methods: A total of 59 children aged 8-17 years (35% female) were recruited through the emergency department (ED) of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The key outcome measures were visual analog scale ratings of pain intensity and fear of pain, administrated before and right after the procedure. Patient satisfaction was also measured after the intervention. Results: A significant reduction in fear of pain and pain intensity was reported in all three conditions. A larger and statistically significant reduction in fear of pain was observed among children who used VR distraction compared with the CL and TV conditions, but this effect was not observed for pain intensity. The children's satisfaction with the VR procedure was significantly higher than for TV and comparable to CL. Discussion: The advantages of using VR in the ED to manage pain in children are discussed.","137":null,"138":null,"139":"To develop and test the feasibility and preliminary impact of the social card game prototype, One Night Stan, a theory-driven and evidence-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention intervention for young black women. The study included the enrollment of 21 young, heterosexual black women (mean age 19) to test the feasibility and preliminary impact of the card game, using a pre\/postdesign. Participant satisfaction and gameplay experience were assessed using quantitative and qualitative measures. Knowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions regarding condom use and HIV\/sexually transmitted infection partner testing were assessed using standardized assessments. Effect sizes for the change in these outcome variables were calculated to determine the preliminary efficacy of the game. One hundred percent of participants reported that that they would play the game again, 95% liked the way the game looked, 100% enjoyed playing the game, and 100% reported that they would tell their friends to play. Effect sizes were large (ranged from 0.21 to 0.51) for all variables except perceived susceptibility (0.07) and suggest that playing the game can lead to increased self-efficacy and intentions to use condoms and insist that their partners get tested for HIV across time. One Night Stan is a feasible intervention approach and may be efficacious in helping players develop a pattern of cognitions and motivation that can protect them against the risk of HIV. ","140":"Objective: Choosing inappropriate or unethical actions in games is referred to as dark play. For a serious game on delirium for medical students, we aimed to investigate the potential differences between dark play and normal play on game effectiveness regarding abilities in advising care, learning motivation and engagement, and attitude toward delirious patients. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the use of different game features between the two types of play on empathy, self-efficacy, and consequences of care. Methods: We performed a two-arm randomized controlled trial including an exploratory qualitative approach with 157 medical students, who played the serious game \"The Delirium Experience.\" Participants were randomly allocated to either the dark play or normal play group. Participants had to give three recommendations for taking care of delirious patients, and complete both the Delirium Attitude Scale, and Learning Motivation and Engagement Questionnaire to study game effectiveness. To explore game features, open questions were asked. Results: We did not find difference between the two types of play in game effectiveness. \"Patient's and nurse's perspective\" seem to be an important game feature for being able to empathize with a patient in both groups. To support self-efficacy, \"practice how to care\" and \"feedback in the game\" were important in both study groups. \"Being able to see the importance of good interaction with the patient\" was reported important for self-efficacy in the dark play group, whereas this was \"seeing the consequences of care\" in the normal play group. Conclusions: There seems to be no change to game effectiveness when providing players the opportunity to use dark play in a serious game. A realistic view of another person's perspective could be an important game feature to increase empathy.","141":null,"142":null,"143":null,"144":null,"145":null,"146":"Objective: This study was performed to investigate the effect of strengthening executive functions through group games on social skills of preschool children. Materials and Methods: This was a quasiexperimental study with experimental and control groups and pretest-posttest design. The statistical population included all the preschool children in Bojnord, Iran. The study population consisted of 30 preschool children who were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The intervention of strengthening executive functions was based on games that were performed in twelve 45-minute sessions in the experimental group. The collected data were analyzed using independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS, version 23. Results: At the posttest stage, suitable social behaviors, nonsocial behaviors, and aggressive-impulsive behaviors were significantly different between the experimental and control groups by controlling the effect of pretest. Discussion: Strengthening the dimensions of executive functions, such as inhibitory response, self-regulation, and cognitive flexibility, through team games improves social skills in children. Conclusion: Group games by strengthening executive functions can develop social skills in preschool children.","147":"Objective: Exergames are popular technology applications that encourage individuals to engage in exercise and create positive moods for players. However, little is known as to whether playing exergames makes players perceive to be more energetic and relaxed and whether enthusiasm about doing exercise moderates such perceptions. To answer these questions, we use the Flow Theory and the Self-Determination Theory to develop the hypotheses. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial, which randomly assigned 337 participants to an intervention group and a control group. We asked the participants in the intervention group to play exergames for 2 weeks. We measured enthusiasm about doing exercise by asking the participants to evaluate themselves as having enthusiasm on doing exercise or not. We measured participants' perceptions of happiness, perceived energy (the perception of sufficient physical and mental resources), and relaxation before and after the 2-week exergame playing, generating scores to represent their changes. Results: We found that playing exergames induces positive changes in happiness, perceived energy, and relaxation. Such changes were significant for participants who are enthusiastic about doing exercise, but not for those who are unenthusiastic about doing exercise. Conclusion: This study was the first using the Flow Theory and the Self-Determination Theory to examine the impact of playing exergames on players' perceptions and to identify the moderator role of enthusiasm about doing exercise. These positive impacts of exergames can be used in rehabilitation settings in encouraging positive attitudes and behaviors toward exercise.","148":"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate which narrative elements of digital game narratives are preferred by the general adolescent population, and to examine associations with gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and gameplay frequency. Further, the study aims to discuss how results can be translated to serious digital games. Materials and Methods: Adolescents were recruited through school to complete a survey on narrative preferences in digital games. The survey included questions on sociodemographic information, frequency of gameplay, and an open-ended question on what could be an appealing narrative for them. Data were analyzed in a mixed-methods approach, using thematic analysis and chi-square analyses to determine narrative preferences and the associations between game narrative elements and player characteristics (gender, SES, and frequency of gameplay). Results: The sample consisted of 446 adolescents (12-15 years old) who described 30 narrative subthemes. Preferences included human characters as protagonists; nonhuman characters only as antagonists; realistic settings, such as public places or cities; and a strong conflict surrounding crime, catastrophe, or war. Girls more often than boys defined characters by their age, included avatars, located the narrative in private places, developed profession-related skills, and included a positive atmosphere. Adolescents of nonacademic education more often than adolescents of academic education defined characters by criminal actions. Infrequent players more often included human characters defined by their age than frequent players. After performing a Bonferroni correction, narrative preferences for several gender differences remained. Conclusion: Different narrative elements related to subgroups of adolescents by gender, SES, and frequency of gameplay. Customization of narratives in serious digital health games should be warranted for boys and girls; yet, further research is needed to specify how to address girls in particular.","149":"Objective: Depression is common in cancer patients. We investigated the effects of playing a serious game in breast cancer patients with mild to moderate depression using functional neuroimaging. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five participants were randomly assigned to the Game group and the Nongame group, and fifteen participants in each group completed the study protocol. Participants in the Game group were asked to play a serious game, \"Hit the Cancer\" (RAW HAND, Seoul, Korea), for at least 30 minutes\/day, 5 days\/week, for 3 weeks. Participants in the Nongame group received usual care. At baseline and follow-up, all participants were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, Stress Response Inventory (SRI), and 3-Tesla resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) between the brain regions in the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) were analyzed. Results: After the intervention, BDI and SRI scores in the Game group greatly decreased compared with those in the Nongame group. In addition, compared with the Nongame group, the Game group showed decreased postintervention FC between the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the DMN and right insula of the SN. The improvement in BDI and SRI scores correlated with the decrease in FC between the right PCC and right insula. Conclusion: Selective attention training and repetitive stimulation of the insula by serious game play might cause normalization of the FC between the SN and DMN, thus improving depressive mood.","150":null,"151":"The purpose of the study was to compare a cognitive training game, Kawashima Brain Training (KBT), and an action videogame, Super Mario Bros (SMB), in their effects on cognitive function in older adults. Thirty-six older adults were randomly assigned to the KBT group, the SMB group, or the no-training no-contact control group. All participants completed several cognitive tests [matrix reasoning, Stroop, Trail Making Test, digit symbol substitution test (DSST), Corsi clock, spatial relation, and number comparison]. Then, participants in the game groups were instructed to play the videogame (KBT or SMB) for 1 hour, thrice per week, during 2 months, for a total training time of 24 hours. When the twenty-four 1-hour game sessions were complete, the three groups again completed the cognitive tests. Analysis of variances on each of the cognitive measures and Tukey's post hoc tests showed that the matrix reasoning change score was significantly greater in both game groups than in the control group. The Stroop test change was significantly greater in the KBT group than in control and SMB groups. The DSST, Corsi block test, spatial relations test, and number comparison test showed significantly greater change in the SMB group than in the control group with KBT intermediate. The scope of benefits of SMB training seems broader than those from the KBT program. The intrinsic characteristics of SMB and KBT games may well be partly responsible for these differences.

Information was abstracted from 22 publications. To be included, the publication had to include a videogame or interactive experience involving games (a videogame alone, minigames inserted into a larger multimedia experience, or game as part of a human-delivered intervention); game's design objective was to influence dietary behavior, a psychosocial determinant of a dietary behavior, or nutrition knowledge (hereinafter referred to as diet-related); must have been reported in English and must have appeared in a professional publication, including some report of outcomes or results (thereby passing some peer review). This review was restricted to the diet-related information in the selected games. Diversity in targeted dietary knowledge and intake behaviors, targeted populations\/audiences, game mechanics, behavioral theories, research designs, and findings was revealed. The diversity and quality of the research in general was poor, precluding a meta-analysis or systematic review. All but one of the studies reported some positive outcome from playing the game(s). One reported that a web-based education program resulted in more change than the game-based intervention. Studies of games may have been missed; a number of dietary\/nutrition games are known for which no evaluation is known; and the data presented on the games and research were limited and inconsistent.

This alarming trend stresses the need for the development of effective strategies that might aid with this growing population. Exergaming has several advantages as an ASD intervention, such as flexible play, a private space for exercise, and diverse types of physical activity. The study aims to analyze the effectiveness of exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies which employed exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion. Exergaming-related changes in participants' physical and cognitive functions were the main interest of the current review. Ten articles satisfied the predetermined eligibility criteria. Thematic coding categorized the main outcomes into two higher-order themes and five subthemes. The higher-order themes were physical performance and cognitive performance. The emerged subthemes were physical fitness, motor performance, intensity of physical activity, executive function, and self-perception. Following exergame interventions, individuals with ASD indicated significant improvements in physical fitness, executive function, and self-perception. Exergaming also increased participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. In contrast, exergaming indicated small impact on emotional regulation and did not provide adequate opportunities for motor skill development. It is worth noting that only one randomized controlled trial was included in the current review. Future research would require more rigorous study designs to provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of exergaming interventions for individuals with ASD. Exergaming interventions lead to improved physical and cognitive functions in individuals with ASD. It is suggested that exergaming be used as a feasible supplement to traditional physical activity programs for individuals with ASD.","155":null,"156":null,"157":null,"158":"We studied which games and underlying game mechanics are considered motivating by older adults, so that designers and therapists make informed choices when designing or selecting virtual reality (VR)-training interventions. We conducted a repeated measures design with 30 older participants, who played eight different VR-training games and afterward filled out the intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI). Differences in intrinsic motivation between games were analyzed using Friedman's tests. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted according to the laddering technique, to unveil the underlying game mechanics that lead to the players preferences. IMI scores were relatively high for all games, indicating that these VR games seem effective for inducing a high intrinsic motivation. Wii yoga and Kinect Adventures were the highest scoring games on all but the negative subscale tension. Both games provided regular positive feedback. An important game mechanic was Variation, which showed a strong link to important values such as: to Stay Focused, Improve Fitness, and Health and Independency. Furthermore, the game mechanics Visual Feedback and Positive Feedback, which lead to an increased Drive to Perform, were perceived valuable. Seemingly contradicting, but both important attributes such as Speed versus Slow Movements emphasize the importance of designing VR training that adapts to the skill level of the player. We have shown that games with different game mechanics can induce high intrinsic motivation. When designing or selecting VR balance training games for older adults, these game mechanics should be incorporated to optimize a positive user experience and increase intrinsic motivation.

Participants were randomized to one of three groups: one group played an off-the-shelf videogame (i.e., Crazy Taxi), the second group engaged in a computerized training program focused on visual attention and processing speed (i.e., PositScience InSight), and the third group received no training. Training in the two intervention conditions consisted of 60 training sessions of 1 hour each, which were completed in 3 months (5 hours a week). Participants received a broad battery of cognitive and everyday functioning assessments immediately before (pretest), after (post-test), and 3 months after (follow-up) training. Both training conditions improved on direct assessments of trained outcomes. In the InSight-trained group, we found transfer to untrained measures of visual attention and processing speed that were similar to the trained tasks, and these gains endured for up to 3 months. Participants in the videogame condition showed small additional benefits, not emerging until 3 months after intervention completion, on a measure of both attention and mood. No trained groups showed gain on visuospatial skills or memory. Training effects were highly specific to the target of training. Training effects to visual attention and processing speed were, as expected, larger for InSight-trained participants but were also seen for videogame participants. Given that past research has shown that videogame training leads to greater engagement than cognitive training, videogame interventions may represent a choice for more modest gains in a more engaging context.

A systematic review of controlled trials published between January 2009 and December 2017 was conducted. The PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus, and Medline databases were searched. Studies involved patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease or children with cerebral palsy. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. A total of 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. The PEDro scores ranged from 4 to 8 points. Analysis of the rehabilitation programs revealed a very large discrepancy in the planned volume of exercises in different subgroups of patients. Overall, the comparison of VR interventions between conventional rehabilitation and no intervention exhibited significantly better results. However, these results should be interpreted with great caution due to the large diversity of the systems, games, and training volume used in the VR therapy. In all included studies, only several articles included objective methods to assess the effect of VR.

For this scoping review, the CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published from January 1, 2008 to December 20, 2017 using terms relevant to digital games and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Eight articles met the inclusion\/exclusion criteria, seven of which presented studies with participants 50 years or older. Five of the eight studies assessed physical activity. Only two studies included a control group. Digital games significantly improved exercise capacity and energy expenditure but did not affect quality of life, self-efficacy, anxiety, or depression. Digital games were found enjoyable by 79%-93% of participants, including those with lower education or age; however, barriers to game use included being tired or bored, lack of interest in digital games, poor perception of fitness through games, sensor limitations, conflicts with daily life routine, and preferences for group exercise. Average adherence ranged from 70% to 100% over 2 weeks to 6 months of study duration, with higher adherence rates in studies that included human contact through supervision or social support. Paucity of studies about digital games for CVD SM behaviors precludes the need to undertake a full systematic review.

We also investigated how cybersickness impacts the sense of presence one feels in the virtual environment, as well as how cybersickness affects enjoyment. Participants played randomly assigned VR games that varied in the level of sensory conflict they provided: \"Lucky's Tale,\" \"Elite: Dangerous,\" and \"Minecraft.\" Results were compared based on two headset conditions-the Oculus DK2 and the recently released Oculus Rift Consumer Version (CV1). Cybersickness was not reduced by playing games with a VR HMD of higher technological quality-the Oculus Rift CV1. Furthermore, cybersickness responses were significantly different based on the level of sensory conflict in the games. Games with less sensory conflict, such as third-person platformer games, or space and flight simulator games, produce less cybersickness in players than first-person games. Enjoyment of VR games was shown to be directly influenced by a sense of spatial presence, which was affected by interactivity and realism. Findings suggest that the variables that are important to the enjoyment of console, mobile, or motion-based games are consistently important to enjoyment of VR games. Better technology does not affect the frequency or severity of cybersickness for players; but sensory conflict has a significant impact on how sick users become. Additionally, we present a model that indicates how enjoyment is produced in VR gaming experiences. These findings bear further investigation as new methods of interacting with VR games are developed.

A key strength of the present study is the collaboration with students to educate game development. The research team pooled its ideas to create a trivia game and an interactive scenario game that were pilot tested on first-year students in a midsized campus of a northeastern university. \"Each game included subject matter related to sexual assault and bystander intervention, as well as general campus information so the main themes of the game would not be overt and potentially cause participants to resist shifting their attitudes about sexual assault and bystander intervention.\" Participants completed a pretest and posttest at each testing session and were invited to complete an online follow-up survey 4 weeks following the session. Researchers found that both games had a significant impact on participant bystander efficacy and attitude scores. The interactive scenario game was especially effective in increasing male attitudes toward bystander intervention. The results were most salient for the posttest; however, there was also an increase in male attitudes at the 4-week follow-up. The student input was invaluable to the success of the game prototypes. With their help, we concluded that gameplay shows promise as an effective way to introduce the concept of bystander intervention and increase bystander attitudes and efficacy in situations of sexual and relationship violence and stalking to first-year college students.

Dysregulation in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit has been implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, as have decreased functional connectivity (FC) between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the prefrontal cortex and increased FC between the dACC and the basal ganglia. We hypothesized that a new ERP-inspired mobile \"serious game\" would improve clinical symptoms in OCD and that symptom improvement would be associated with altered FC within CSTC. Fifteen OCD subjects and 15 healthy controls were recruited. All subjects completed questionnaires covering demographic data, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Beck Depressive Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. In addition, all subjects were scanned at baseline to assess brain FC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After 3 weeks of gameplay, FC from the left dACC seed to the right frontal precentral gyrus and from the right dACC seed to the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus, increased in the OCD group. Responders showed increased brain connectivity from the left dACC seed to the right superior frontal gyrus compared with nonresponders. Our results suggest that serious games may improve symptoms in OCD and that this improvement may be related to increased brain connectivity between the dACC and the prefrontal cortex.

We evaluated digital games that were based on validated psychological treatments. We located 24 studies and 18 games that met our search criteria. These games and their outcomes have been summarized. This review showed that these types of games have the potential to make an impact on mental health concerns but that there are currently few digital games available for the treatment or prevention of mental disorders. In addition, guidelines for digital mental health intervention game development have been presented.

Based on literature review, our goal is to propose an updated taxonomy taking into account the works, updates, and innovations in game criteria that have been researched since our first publication in 2010. In addition, we aim to present the validation mechanism used for the proposed extended taxonomy. Based on a literature review in the area and on the analysis of the contributions made by other researchers, we propose an extended taxonomy for SGHR. For validating the taxonomy proposal, a questionnaire was designed to use on a survey among experts in the area. An extended taxonomy for SGHR was proposed. As we have identified that, in general, and besides the mechanisms associated with the adoption of a given taxonomy, there were no reported validation mechanisms for the proposals, we designed a mechanism to validate our proposal. The mechanism uses a questionnaire addressed to a sample of researchers and professionals with experience and expertise in domains of knowledge interrelated with SGHR, such as Computer Graphics, Game Design, Interaction Design, Computer Programming, and Health Rehabilitation.

Therefore, this study used the perspective of social cognitive theory (SCT) to identify potential moderators (i.e., whether the user is optimistic or attempting to control his or her weight) of the impact of playing exergames on user-perceived happiness. This large-scale randomized controlled trial recruited 337 college students (of whom 57.3% were female and all were aged 20-40 years) as participants. The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. Participants in the intervention group were asked to use an Xbox 360 to play 1 of 10 exergame programs for 30 minutes once a week for 2 weeks. Participants in the control group were not required to do so. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used for the analyses. The analytical results indicate that playing exergames helped to maintain happiness levels and prevented them from decreasing. The maintained happiness was more prominent among participants who were trying to control their weight, but did not differ between participants who were highly optimistic and those who were less optimistic. This study is the first using SCT to explain the contingent effect of playing exergames on user happiness.

The purpose of this study was to provide an initial evaluation of the efficacy of the FFW intervention to increase well-being actions. The study design was a secondary data analysis of a large-scale prospective, double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Data were collected at baseline and 30 and 60 days postbaseline. A total of 479 adult employees at a major university in the southeast of the United States of America were enrolled. Participants who were randomly assigned to the FFW group were provided with 30 days of 24-hour access to the intervention. A two-class linear regression model with complier average causal effect estimation was fitted to well-being actions scores at 30 and 60 days. Intent-to-treat analysis provided evidence that the effect of being assigned to the FFW intervention, without considering actual participation in the FFW intervention, had a null effect on each dimension of well-being actions at 30 and 60 days. Participants who complied with the FFW intervention, however, had significantly higher well-being actions scores, compared to potential compliers in the Usual Care group, in the interpersonal dimension at 60 days, and the physical dimension at 30 days.

Ten patients with chronic nonspecific LBP and an underlying motor control impairment were recruited. Subjects performed a partially supervised exercise program (36 sessions, 18 weeks) that included 30 minutes of general conditioning and 90 minutes of individually tailored functional motor control exercises (MCEs). Serious games (SGs) were used to (1) improve thoracolumbar dissociation and (2) to provide postural feedback during functional MCEs. The SGs were also available at home. Treatment satisfaction and the scores on the credibility\/expectancy questionnaire were good and did not change throughout the intervention. Patients remained motivated throughout the rehabilitation program and no serious adverse events were reported. Overall, participants indicated that the SGs helped them to perform the home exercises more correctly, and as a consequence, they felt more confident doing them. However, the time needed to set up the games was a barrier for home use and participants would have found it useful to receive postural feedback during daily life activities. It is feasible to support a functional exercise program with SGs for patients with chronic nonspecific LBP, both in a supervised and a home environment.

Questionnaires evaluated motivation and user experience, and exercise performance was evaluated in terms of work and rest time percentage and maximal voluntary contraction percentage over contraction periods. Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences and increase of means. Participants showed significantly better exercise performance and higher grip forces, with sustained intrinsic motivation and user experience, with the ET.

The game training was compared to a game placebo and a nongame training version in a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 185 adolescents (mean age 14.9 years) in secondary education participated in the study. They performed four sessions of training, as well as a set of questionnaires and cognitive assessment tasks before and after the training. The basis for the training was the stop-signal paradigm, aimed at increasing behavioral control. The game variants were shown to motivate adolescents beyond the level of the nongame version. Behavioral control improved significantly over time, but this effect was also present in the game placebo, suggesting that the game activities alone may have had a beneficial effect on our measures of behavioral control. As baseline drinking levels were low, no significant training effects on drinking behavior were found. Although the current results are not yet conclusive as to whether \"The Fling\" is effective as a cognitive training, they do warrant further research in this direction.

We investigated the feasibility of applying additional VR training focused on sitting balance in CP inpatients of a rehabilitation center after lower limb surgery. Additionally, we investigated the rate of enjoyment of VR training compared with conventional physiotherapy. Eleven spastic CPc (4\/7 males\/females) following rehabilitation after lower limb orthopedic surgery were included (5-18 years). The control group received conventional physiotherapy. The intervention group received additional VR training. Balance was measured using the Trunk Control Measurement Scale every 3 weeks of the rehabilitation period. Enjoyment was analyzed using a 10-point Visual Analog Scale. Providing additional VR training was feasible in terms of recruitment, treatment adherence, and assessment adherence. Both groups improved sitting balance after therapy. The current games were not perceived as more enjoyable than conventional physiotherapy. Including additional VR training to conventional physiotherapy is feasible and might be promising to train sitting balance in CPc after lower limb surgery. Future research should take equal patient allocation and training duration between groups into consideration.

The serious game innovatively incorporates evidence-based HF guidelines with contemporary game technology. The study included three phases: development of the game prototype, its usability assessment, and evaluation of the game's functionality. Usability testing included researchers' usability assessment, followed by research personnel's observations of participants playing the game, and participants' completion of a usability survey. Next, in a pretest-post-test design, validated instruments-the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test and the Self Care for Heart Failure Index-were used to measure improvement in HF self-management knowledge and behaviors related to HF self-maintenance, self-management, and self-efficacy, respectively. A postgame survey assessed participants' perceptions of the game. During usability testing, with seven participants, 100%, 100%, and 86% found the game easy to play, enjoyable, and helpful for learning about HF, respectively. In the subsequent functionality testing, with 19 participants, 89% found the game interesting, enjoyable, and easy to play. Playing the game resulted in a significant improvement in HF self-management knowledge, a nonsignificant improvement in self-reported behaviors related to HF self-maintenance, and no difference in HF self-efficacy scores. Participants with lower education level and age preferred games to any other medium for receiving information.

Children who played alone increased their accuracy performance more than children in the paired-play condition on two measures of EF. The study explored potential covariates of prior videogame experience, age, and enjoyment, but none of these variables related to EF change. This study's findings support active videogame play as an activity that can boost EF skills for children with special needs when they play alone.

Recently, digital gaming interventions delivered on computers or mobile devices have emerged as another way to promote safer sex behavior in a young population. Tailoring these computer-based interventions to their target population has been recognized to increase positive behavior outcomes. In this qualitative study, we investigated whether young female and male adults from two different cultural backgrounds (all living in Germany) would have different preferences and needs in relation to an educational game promoting safer sex. We conducted four semistructured focus group interviews comprising open-ended questions with male and female participants who had either a German or a Turkish background. In total, 20 individuals, aged between 18 and 22 years, from two socially diverse and ethnically mixed vocational schools in Germany participated. Independent of cultural background and gender, participants preferred a real-world design with a first-person visual perspective over a fantasy-like third-person perspective. Furthermore, they preferred highly customizable avatars. All participants mentioned the importance of including an alcohol-intoxicated avatar and most participants wanted there to be additional information available about various safer sex approaches and about the use of different barrier protection methods. Males and females reported similar preferences for the design of an educational game promoting safer sex, with the only difference being exactly how the topic of having sexual intercourse should be addressed in the game. Males preferred a direct approach, whereas females had a preference for treating this subject more sympathetically. Educational games offer anonymity and can provide young people across different cultural backgrounds with gender-tailored opportunities to experiment with specific safer sex precautions in a nonthreatening virtual environment, free from unwanted parental control and peer monitoring.

Innovative methods are needed to develop Exergames that increase and maintain PA. Self-representational avatars, or avatars created from a digital image of an individual, may increase PA (e.g., intensity, duration) during Exergame play. This article addresses this novel idea by describing the development of an Exergame played with a self-representational avatar. Twelve- to 14-year-olds, stratified by gender, body mass index, and PA, were invited to participate in two rounds of data collection. Each round consisted of an online survey, followed by a telephone interview to ensure comprehension of survey responses. After the first round, an Exergame prototype and the system for creating the self-representational avatar were created. A second round of data was collected to obtain information with which to create a fully functional Exergame and the avatar creation system. Forty-eight teens were recruited. The sample was multi-ethnic (41.7% White, 37.5% Black, 18.8% Hispanic, 2.1% Mixed\/Other). Complete data were obtained on 48 teens in the first round of data collection and on 43 teens in the second round. Teens provided important information regarding preferences and expectations.

One group played an off-the-shelf videogame (i.e., Crazy Taxi), and the other group played a brain training game (i.e., Insight). Training consisted of 60 training sessions of 1 hour each, which were completed in 3 months (5 hours a week). After each training session, participants completed a Flow questionnaire to measure their engagement with the training. The analysis was performed with a linear growth curve model. The results indicate that on average, there was no change in flow for the Insight group between time points. There was no difference between the initial flow status of the Insight group and the Crazy Taxi group. However, the interaction between group membership and time was statistically significant, indicating that the participants in the Crazy Taxi group increased their scores at each week at a rate that was 0.99 larger than those in the Insight group.

Each of these games fits one specific subgroup of users best: the quiz platform best fits an eager-to-learn, more individualistic patient, whereas the board game best fits a less-eager-to-learn, family-oriented patient. The choice for a specific concept is therefore highly dependent on the choice of our specific target audience.

Recently published research has shown that videogames have significant potential to promote healthy behaviors among youth and adolescents. Yet, there is a lack of available evidence-based resources to guide practitioners on the integration of games into tobacco prevention and smoking cessation interventions. To address this gap, expert researchers and game developers were interviewed to further define games for health, explore the current research, and provide recommendations for developing, evaluating, and promoting effective anti-tobacco games. Nationally recognized experts on game development, games for health, tobacco, and health behavior were asked to participate. A qualitative analysis of 25 in-depth individual interviews using a constant comparative approach for emerging themes was conducted. Main themes that emerged from the data analysis included the following: (1) the current state of games for health research to facilitate health behavior change, (2) strategies for how to develop and evaluate games for quality and impact, and (3) recommendations for how to effectively design tobacco prevention and smoking cessation educational videogames that engage youth and adolescents.

Participants attended four weekly gameplay sessions. Surveys were conducted at baseline and following each week's gameplay and assessed satisfaction with gameplay, craving intensity, and self-efficacy to refuse opioids. Participants expressed a high level of satisfaction with the videogame throughout the 4 weeks and agreed with the statement that they would be more likely to attend treatment sessions if the game was present (mean=4.6; standard deviation [SD]=0.7) and would recommend the videogame to other people in treatment (mean=4.2; SD=0.8). All participants recommended playing the videogame as part of treatment at least weekly, with a third recommending playing daily. Self-reported cravings declined over the 4-week period from baseline (mean=12.7; SD=8.4) to Week 4 (mean=9.8; SD=8.3), although the decline was not significant. Although participants stated that they liked the game, one-third of participants had dropped out of the study by the fourth session of gameplay.

Twenty chronic stroke patients were randomized to either the rehabilitation game group or the conventional training group. Both groups received three arm training sessions of 30 minutes each week, during a period of 6 weeks. Arm (the upper extremity part of Fugl-Meyer [FM] assessment) and hand (the Action Research Arm [ARA] test) functions were tested 1 week before (T0) and 1 week after (T1) training. A follow-up measurement was performed at 1 month after T1 (T2). ARA and FM scores improved significantly within both groups. Post hoc comparisons revealed significant increases in test scores between T0 and T1 and between T0 and T2 for both ARA and FM, but not for changes from T1 to T2.

Fifty-four articles were identified, including 32 studies that examined the immediate PA effects (i.e., energy expenditure and PA levels during AVG play), one survey study, and 21 intervention studies aimed to promote PA. AVGs led to light- to moderate-intensity PA among studies of immediate PA outcomes. No effect was identified of AVGs on PA in the home setting. Moderate evidence was found that structured AVG play could improve PA. Inconclusive evidence was found for the effect of AVGs on PA in multiple settings.

Gameplayers did not show greater empathy than text readers, and women in the text condition reported the greatest empathy for Jamal (P=0.008). However, high empathy only predicted lower levels of implicit bias among those who actively took Jamal's perspective through gameplay (P=0.014).

This study investigated the appropriateness of using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to predict what drives occupational therapists' use of this ad hoc, intuitive, and idiosyncratic intervention strategy with their older adult clients. A cross-sectional Web-based survey of occupational therapists who primarily work with older adults was designed to measure constructs based from the validated UTAUT. Evidence was elicited from 516 occupational therapists. Analyses included descriptive analyses, Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and examination of goodness of fit criteria and factor loading indicators. The results confirmed that performance expectancy, attitude, and social influence significantly contribute to occupational therapists' behavioral intention to use off-the-shelf virtual gaming as an intervention strategy with older adults in occupational therapy. Contrary to technology acceptance research, performance expectancy had a negative impact on behavioral intention in this study. The research model explained 83 percent of the variance in behavioral intention and 30 percent of the variance in use behavior.

Noncomputerized games were used to combine social interaction and cognitive training that challenged attentional and memory function for 1 hour each week over the span of 10 weeks. One game used in the intervention program was created by adapting a working memory training task into a fun and competitive card game; the other two games were commercially available. The intervention and pre\/post assessments were able to be delivered in a community setting. Overall retention was satisfactory, but it dropped in later weeks of the intervention. Older adult participants reported enjoying the games and being invested in their performance. They also reported playing the games with family and friends at home. Older adult participants complied with game rules but were reluctant to comply with instructions to rotate game partners and game types. They preferred their first partners, and they preferred the card game over the existing commercial games. This intervention has the potential to improve quality of life and reduce disparities in cognitive health in older adults because it is an accessible game-based intervention program that motivates older adult participants to engage cognitively and to continue this engagement beyond the formal training sessions.

Four players-a researcher, a transportation expert, a local community coordinator, and a healthcare worker-collaborate as an interdisciplinary team to help limit ongoing and future polio outbreaks in Pakistan, represented on the game board. Participants who played or observed the game and those who did not participate in the game, but visited noninteractive global health exhibits, completed a survey on participation outcomes. We used relative risk regression to examine associations between cofactors and change in global health interest. Three variables predicted increased global health interest among the game participants: Having little or no previous global health knowledge prior to playing the game (risk ratio [RR]=1.28; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.45), not currently being involved in global health (RR=1.41; 95 percent CI, 1.07-1.85), and visiting Seattle (RR=1.25; 95 percent CI, 1.04-1.51). Our results suggest that a hands-on, interactive game may increase the public's interest in global health, particularly among those with minimal previous knowledge of or involvement in global health activities.

Meanwhile, increased access to information technology in recent years among seniors has led to the increased applicability of games aiding senior activities that incorporate information technology. In this study, we constructed and assessed a nursing intervention incorporating an actual walking exercise game developed for the use of seniors in order to identify the cognitive, social, and physical impact it has on their health behaviors. This quasi-experimental study used a one-group pre-\/post-test design in which 15 people 65 years of age or older were selected to participate through a serious health game conducted at the senior welfare center twice a week, for 12 weeks. Besides having their basic physical measurements taken, seniors participated in physical exercise sessions that included educational content. The measured variables were health beliefs and concerns, subjective knowledge, subjective norms, perceived reliability, perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived behavioral control, attitudes about health behaviors, intentions to perform health behaviors, health behaviors, blood pressure, pulse rate, endurance, agility and balance, and flexibility. Significant increases in health beliefs and concerns, perceived reliability, perceived behavioral control, perceived ease of use, attitudes about health behaviors, and intentions to perform health behaviors were observed at post-test, compared with pre-test data points. These increases were also recorded for physical domains. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse rates were noted immediately after the intervention, along with increased endurance levels, indicating that the exercise had an effect on participants' health. Ongoing research is required regarding the development and impact of distinctive nursing interventions, conducted through various forms of serious health games relatively easy to use, by integrating various motivating factors for engaging in health behaviors and the entertainment value of such games.

Three versions of the game (iPAD, Facebook, and Web-based) were developed using HTML5. A theoretical framework that involved game-based learning and participatory design approach was used to design, develop, modify, and optimize the game for use with secondary school students (n=1176) 12-16 years of age. Pre- and post-test scores of students' safer sex knowledge were compared to test the effectiveness of the game. Students' survey and interviews were analyzed to assess participant feelings and attitudes toward the game. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test indicated that students' sex knowledge (n=788) improved with a medium effect size (0.477) after playing the game. Increases in positive attitudes toward sex and relationship and in awareness of making smart sexual choices were reported from student surveys and interviews. Students described the game as \"interesting,\" \"interactive,\" \"informative,\" and \"real-to-life.\" We advocate that the participatory design approach, which supports collaborative efforts of different stakeholders, is an effective framework for developing game-based learning tools for sex education. Our work provides preliminary findings that suggest game-based learning, preferably delivered through popular interactive platforms, can be effective in promoting sex education to teenagers.

Likert scales were used to obtain subjective responses to the balance games. GMFM scores correlated with game performance, especially measures emphasizing rhythmic sway. Twelve of the 15 subjects enjoyed the game and asserted an interest in playing again. Digital posturography games engage children with cerebral palsy in balance tasks, provide visual feedback in a balance control task, and have the potential to increase autonomy in balance control training among pediatric patients with cerebral palsy. This approach can support the relationship between child and therapist.

The program uses an innovative platform including interactive instructional segments and skill-building games to help adolescents learn and practice coping skills training strategies. We conducted a pilot test with nine adolescents in substance abuse treatment (44 percent female) and a feasibility test with treatment providers (n=8; 50 percent female). Adolescents interacted with the program via a secure Web site for approximately 30 minutes for each of two instructional units. Treatment providers reviewed the same material at their own pace. All participants completed a questionnaire with items assessing usability, acceptability, understanding, and subjective experience of the program. Regarding feasibility, recruitment of this population within the study constraints proved challenging, but participant retention in the trial was high (no attrition). Adolescents and treatment providers completed the program with no reported problems, and overall we were able to collect data as planned. Regarding acceptability, the program received strong ratings from both adolescents and providers, who found the prototype informative, engaging, and appealing. Both groups strongly recommended continuing development. We were able to deliver the intervention as intended, and acceptability ratings were high, demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of online delivery of engaging interactive interventions.

However, parents frequently report being uncomfortable talking with their youth about sex, often reporting a lack of self-efficacy and skills to inform and motivate responsible decision making by youth. Intergenerational games may support parent-youth sexual health communication. The purpose of this study was to explore parent and youth perspectives on a proposed intergenerational game designed to increase effective parent-youth sexual health communication and skills training. Eight focus groups were conducted: four with parents (n=20) and four with their 11-14-year-old youth (n=19), to identify similarities and differences in perspectives on gaming context, delivery channel, content, and design (components, features, and function) that might facilitate dyadic sexual health communication. Participants concurred that a sex education game could improve communication while being responsive to family time constraints. They affirmed the demand for an immersive story-based educational adventure game using mobile platforms and flexible communication modalities. Emergent themes informed the development of a features inventory (including educational and gaming strategies, communication components, channel, and setting) and upper-level program flow to guide future game development. This study supports the potential of a game to be a viable medium to bring a shared dyadic sexual health educational experience to parents and youth that could engage them in a motivationally appealing way to meaningfully impact their sexual health communication and youth sexual risk behaviors. ","400":"This study was aimed at investigating the links between online gaming and online pornography use by considering gender, problematic Internet use, and different motives for alcohol drinking. University students (n=512; mean age=22.11 years; standard deviation=2.43 years; 64.06 percent women) filled in the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory, Hungarian version, the Problematic Online Gaming Questionnaire, Hungarian version (POGQ-HU), the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire, Hungarian version (PIUQ-HU), and the Drinking Motive Questionnaire Revised Short Form, Hungarian version (DMQ-R-HU SF) questionnaires. According to hierarchical multiple regression analyses, the neglect factor of PIUQ-HU, the conformity factor of DMQ-R-HU SF, and the immersion and preoccupation factors of POGQ-HU have a significant predictive value on one's online pornography use, but gender does not. This research shows that independently from the effect of Internet and alcohol use dimensions, immersion and preoccupation factors of online gaming have significant effects on online pornography use. However, preoccupation has a negative effect on pornography use. Players scoring high on this subscale may think about gaming as the only interesting activity that rates higher than even pornography.

These interventions, however, often ignore the broader sociocultural context in which sexual violence occurs. This calls for innovative approaches in prevention education, which address the broader context. Computer games provide such an opportunity by providing simulated real-life scenarios, nonlinear narratives, and an interactive medium. We report the development and pilot testing of \"Campus Craft,\" a game prototype that focuses, among other things, on sexual assault prevention. The prototype was developed through a participatory design process; students, educators, and subject matter experts helped design and develop scenarios, game mechanics, and learning objectives. The prototype was evaluated by college students (n=141) in a multi-method approach. The evaluation encompassed issues of usability, game mechanics, attitudes, and learning outcomes. Findings indicated that participants rated various aspects of the game positively. Additionally, use of \"Campus Craft\" contributed to differences in student learning of prevention concepts between the pre- and post-test such that students scored higher on the post-test. Findings demonstrate that, on average, students learned several core concepts related to sexual consent and rape culture through gameplay. Results suggest that computer-based gaming may be a viable avenue for sexual assault prevention education. Findings demonstrate that this approach could be effective in increasing student knowledge and understanding of factors that contribute to sexual assault in college. Future research is needed to corroborate findings and better understand the feasibility of using this approach among larger samples of college students.

Furthermore, they can tailor messages to the individual's needs and may be intrinsically motivating. This meta-analysis investigates the effectiveness of interventions for sexual health promotion that use serious games. A database search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for publications before the end of July 2013. Serious digital games studies measuring effects on behavior or its determinants, using a control condition, allowing the calculation of an effect size (Hedges' g, random-effects model) were included. Seven game studies for sexual health promotion were included. These showed positive effects on determinants (g=0.242; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.129, 0.356), albeit of small effect size. The effects on behavior, measured in only two studies, were not significant (g=0.456; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.649, 1.561). Most games did not use many game features that are considered to be immersive or enhancing flow. Instead, there was a strong reliance on pure gamification features, such as rewards and feedback. The effectiveness of the next generation of games may be enhanced by building on the behavioral change and educational gaming literatures (e.g., using role-play and simulation game formats, individual tailoring, offering adaptation in the difficulty of the challenge, and amount and timing of the feedback). There is a need for studies with rigorous evaluations of game effectiveness, longer-term follow-up, and using measures of behavior rather than merely their determinants.

This article presents a summary of the concepts discussed. The discussants concluded that, although formative research may slightly expand the project timeline, the potential benefits include a game more in line with preferences of the intended users, with better operationalized theoretical constructs and broader stakeholder support, facilitating implementation and sustainability. It also improves the efficiency of other research parts because of a lower dropout rate of participants. Formative, qualitative research is thus a necessary complement to quantitative measurements of intervention outcomes, in a sort of Yin and Yang dynamic. An adapted version of formative research that casts a wider net may, however, be needed, involving both behavioral scientists and game developers, expanding the topics beyond the game's looks and soliciting the opinions of a larger group of stakeholders, such as implementers, gatekeepers, and funders.

","411":null,"412":"Children and adolescents most often play active videogames, or exergames, in a social environment. Social play may enhance the potential benefits of an exergaming experience, much like group exercise and team sports are observed to improve physical activity-related outcomes above those of solitary exercise. Two ubiquitous elements of exergames are cooperation and competition. Previous literature suggests that cooperative and competitive aspects of exergames may affect physiological and psychosocial changes. Competitive play has been found to increase energy expenditure and aggression in short bouts of exergaming. Cooperative exergaming has been found to increase motivation, promote continued play, enhance self-efficacy, and increase pro-social behaviors. In one study, a cooperative exergaming condition also resulted in significant weight loss for overweight and obese adolescents. Individual player differences such as individual preferences, competitiveness, weight status, age, gender, and ethnicity may moderate effects. Although the current volume of literature on competition and cooperation in exergaming is small, social exergames hold promise as an engaging alternative to traditional physical activity interventions and may promote a broad range of positive outcomes for children and adolescents. Principles of cooperation and competition are applicable for developers of health-promoting games. Future research is needed to further understand the mechanisms of how competition and cooperation in social exergaming impact physiological and psychosocial outcomes. ","413":"Narratives are stories with a beginning, middle, and end that provide information about the characters and plot. Exergames are videogames that require players to move or exercise. Narratives and exergames have seldom been examined together. Based on my review of the literature, there are five potential opportunities narratives could bring to exergames: Enhanced engagement with characters and with the plot, increased motivation, repeated play sessions, and better behavioral consequence. However, the rewards offered by these possibilities may be offset by the challenges they pose. These challenges include the difficulty in fully integrating narratives into the gameplay, the players' limited information processing capacity, difficulty in measurement, the lack of full understanding of the player-character identification process, and the narrative saturation effects. Innovative research is needed to bridge the two potentially important domains. ","414":"This article reviews theoretical and empirical evidence related to three mechanisms for encouraging enjoyment during exergame play: Feedback, challenge, and rewards. A literature search and narrative review were conducted. Feedback is found in nearly all exergames, and richer, more in-depth feedback is associated with increased activity. Challenge is a vital component of any videogame, and exergames include physical as well as cognitive challenges. Flow states have traditionally been conceptualized as occurring when an optimal match between player skills and game challenge occurs. However, failure and retrial are necessary for feelings of overall satisfaction and fun, despite not necessarily being ideally fun or satisfying themselves. Rewards are a more complicated issue, with significant theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting positive and negative effects of reward systems. How rewards are integrated into the mechanics and storyline of the game likely impacts how they are perceived and, thus, their effectiveness. Finally, integration of these mechanisms into exergames requires specific attention to both cognitive and physical implementations. Movements that are not themselves enjoyable or engaging may lead to cheating and lower energy expenditure. Feedback, challenge, and rewards are promising mechanisms by which exergames could become more enjoyable. How these concepts are operationalized can affect physical and psychological reactions to exergames. Attention to these concepts in future exergame development and implementation would benefit theory, research, and practice.

The aim of the game is to promote healthy dietary intake and physical activity among secondary vocational educational students in The Netherlands (approximately 16-20 years of age). The game \"Balance It\" was developed according to an intervention mapping (IM) protocol. Following IM, we specified health promotion and usability objectives and linked these objectives to selected behavior change and persuasive methods. Accordingly, these methods were translated into a coherent intervention program. The health behavior change objectives were derived from the determinants of the behavior and from Self-Regulation Theory (e.g., students are asked to set goals, monitor and evaluate their behavior, and create coping plans). Usability objectives were derived from the RE-AIM model (i.e., Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance). Next, behavior change and persuasive techniques were selected (e.g., goal setting and prompting, respectively) that did fit with the targeted change objectives and were translated in the design of a (mobile) serious self-regulation game intervention. Subsequently, three concept and usability tests were performed to improve intervention usability, and an evaluation plan was developed. The aim of this study was to provide a design rationale for game interventions targeting health-related behaviors. We developed a coherent program design in which both health behavior change and usability factors are addressed.

Three different tests from the Senior Fitness Test were used in order to test a variety of health parameters of the community-dwelling elderly, including those parameters related to fall prevention. Materials and Methods: Eighteen community-dwelling elderly individuals (63-95 years of age; mean, 83.2 years of age) were assessed in one intervention group without the use of a control group. The intervention group performed nine group sessions (1-1.5 hours each) of playful training with the modular interactive tiles over a 12-week period in two community activity centers for the elderly. Data were collected using pre-tests and post-tests of the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the 8-foot Timed Up &amp; Go Test (TUG), and the Chair-Stand Test (CS). Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences and increases of means.

Certain game design parameters that may encourage patients to actively participate by making the games more enjoyable have been identified. In this article, we describe a formative study in which we designed and evaluated some of these parameters with healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: The \"operant conditioning\" and \"scoring\" design parameters were incorporated in a remake of a classic labyrinth game, \"Marble Maze.\" A group of participants (n=37) played the game twice: Once in the control condition without both modalities and then with either one of the parameters or with both. Measures of game duration and number of fails in the game were recorded along with survey questionnaires to measure player perceptions of intrinsic motivation on the game. Results: Longer playtimes, higher levels of interest\/enjoyment, and effort to play the game were recorded with the introduction of these parameters. Conclusions: This study provides an understanding on how game design parameters can be used to motivate and encourage people to play longer. With these positive results, future aims are to test the parameters with stroke patients, providing much clearer insight as to what influences these parameters have on patients undergoing therapy.

Exergames are an attractive alternative to physical therapy. The primary aim of this pilot study was to explore the user experience (usability, satisfaction, level of motivation, and game experience) of the patient with the \"PlayMancer\" exergame. The secondary aim was to explore the progression of the performed motor skills (walking velocity, overhead reach ability, and cervical range of motion) and the clinical changes (to physical condition, disability, and pain intensity) in a group of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain using an exergame for 4 weeks. In the European PlayMancer project, an exergame for physical rehabilitation of chronic pain patients was developed. This exergame is controlled by relevant motions of the patient's body captured by a motion suit and several infrared cameras. In three different integrated minigames, the patient can train the following motor skills: Walking velocity, overhead reaching, and neck mobility. Ten patients participated in this study and completed the 4 weeks of gaming. Patients rated the usability of the exergames as good (score of 78.5 [standard deviation 9.7; range, 60.0-97.5]) on the System Usability Scale, and the game motivated all patients to perform their exercises. Patients enjoyed playing and were pleased with both the game environment and the game play. Overall, the patients made a progression in the examined motor skills during the minigames over the 4 weeks of gaming. The \"PlayMancer\" exergame is a potential tool for achieving physical rehabilitation because it motivates patients to perform their exercises and as a result increases their motor skills and physical condition.

This pre-post intervention-control study (n=590) was conducted in New York City low-income public middle schools. The students (11-13 years of age, 51.6 percent male) played \"Creature-101\" online in science\/health education classes (seven sessions, 30 minutes each session for 1 month). \"Creature-101\" used behavioral theories as the framework for \"creature care\" in a world \"Tween.\" Students were provided with scientific evidence that promoted energy balance through minigames, educational videos, and slideshows and were motivated with interactive dialogues with game characters. Students also assessed their own behaviors, created their own \"real life\" food and activity goals, and reported their progress. A self-reported, validated, online instrument that measured frequency and amount of targeted behaviors was administered at baseline and post-intervention. Analysis of covariance compared post-test means between groups with pretest scores as covariates. Intervention students reported significant decreases in frequency and amount of consumption of sweetened beverages and processed snacks compared with the controls.

Many programs promoting physical activity have generated significant short-term gains, but adherence has been a problem. A recent evidence-based analysis of clinical trials using physical therapy in PD patients produced four key treatment recommendations: cognitive movement strategies, physical capacity, balance training, and cueing. We have attempted to incorporate all four of these features together through a dance exercise program using the dance videogame \"Dance Dance Revolution\" (DDR) (Konami Digital Entertainment, El Segundo, CA). Sixteen medically stable participants with mild to moderate PD were given the opportunity to try DDR with supervision by a research staff member. Feedback about the advantages and disadvantages of DDR as a form of physical activity was elicited through focus groups using the nominal group technique. Of 21 advantages and 17 disadvantages elicited, the most frequently cited advantages were \"fun\" and \"easy to use,\" followed by \"improves balance or coordination,\" \"challenging,\" and \"full body aerobic activity.\" Common concerns were the distracting or confusing interface, cost, and possible technical issues. Interactive dance exercise was appealing to participants with PD and may help promote adherence to physical activity.

A one-factor between-subjects experiment with three conditions (minimal, moderate, and extreme contextual cues of violence) of playing an in-house-developed active videogame was conducted. Activity intensity was objectively measured using the ActiGraph (Pensacola, FL) model GT3X accelerometer. Psychological outcomes were measured using established scales. We did not find that the level of contextual cues of violence had any effect on the outcome variables, although the moderate level of contextual cues of violence resulted in a greater amount of feeling mean (P=0.011) and unsociable (P=0.038) among the players immediately after gameplay than players in the minimal contextual cues of violence condition. We did not find any statistically significant difference among the three conditions in terms of enjoyment, perceived arousal, or activity intensity. This study empirically examined the effects of contextual cues of violence in active videogames on player hostility, arousal, and enjoyment after gameplay as well as their physical activity intensity during gameplay.

Our goal was to increase PA by 40 minutes per week and to determine how much time, if any, was spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Eighty-four middle school youth were in a pilot study for 20 weeks: half in the Generation Fit (GenFit) intervention group and half in the control group. The GenFit group played the exergame for the first 10 weeks (Session 1), and the control group joined from 10 to 20 weeks (Session 2). The main outcome was exergaming time per student per week. Fifty-eight students completed the pilot after 26 youth at School C were excluded for administrative reasons. Of those remaining, 40 students at School A and 18 students at School B, the average age of the sample was 13.7 years (SD=0.6), and average body mass index percentile was close to 70. During Session 1, the average dance time per child was 49 minutes per week, versus 54 minutes per week in Session 2. Mean body mass index percentile decreased by 5.6 for children who participated in GenFit, compared with 0.2 for children in the control group. At end point, accelerometers showed over half of the dance time was spent in MVPA. Qualitative data showed that most children found the exergame acceptable. A dance exergame in middle schools offered opportunities for PA. About half of the exergame time was spent in MVPA. Exergames may be feasible and acceptable in middle schools to boost PA, and access could provide a way for schools to support the health of students.

Findings from each study meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed and summarized into emergent themes to determine the impact of digital games in promoting healthy behaviors among older adults. A systematic review of the research literature was conducted through multiple academic databases for works, published between the years 2000 and 2011, looking at digital videogame interventions with adults 65 years of age and older. Multiple combinations of search terms and Boolean operators relevant to digital videogames and older adults were queried. A criteria matrix was created to code and evaluate studies. Thirteen studies met specific criteria for inclusion and were analyzed in the final review. Significant mental, physical, and social health factors, type of digital game platform, study design, and measurements are among emergent themes summarized from the reviewed research literature. Significant mental health outcomes of digital game interventions were found in the majority of the reviewed studies, followed by physical and lastly social health outcomes in older adults. A majority of the studies revealed significant positive effects on health outcomes associated with digital videogame play among older adults. With current advancements in technology, including advanced motion sensing, digital game platforms have significant potential for positive health impact among older populations. More robust and rigorous research designs are needed to increase validity and reliability of results and establish stronger causal relationships on the health benefits of digital videogame play for older adults.

Tests were held in a room with two deck chairs and one complete set of IC equipment for each of them. A questionnaire with issues about usability, acceptability, game immersion, and subjective experience was administered. Participants did not experience any difficulty in \"moving\" throughout the island. The map was considered useful by most of the users, and so were the narrator's instructions and voice. Previous experience with technology or with the controller did not affect the usability rates. In terms of acceptability, 92.3 percent of the users reported the wish to use IC again if they had the chance, and 73.6 percent would recommend its use in different medical procedures. In terms of immersion, the difference between actual and perceived time using IC was statistically significant (z=-4,141, P&lt;0.001), with the generalized perception of having used less time than what it was actually required.

The pleasure offered by digital games may explain the players' consumption of this activity. Games may elicit both positive and negative emotions, which can be measured by encephalography (EEG). The EEG alpha asymmetry index (AI) is different in positive and negative emotions and so may be used to distinguish positive from negative emotions that occur during gaming. We hypothesized that the \"Counter-Strike\" (CS) game (Valve Software, Bellevue, WA) is pleasurable and demonstrable with a positive EEG AI. Twelve male participants ages 18-30 years underwent EEG recordings continuously during and postgame. EEG was also recorded pregame for control conditions of baseline (sitting on a chair staring at a blank wall), movement (moving fingers on the computer keyboard with a blank screen), sound (listening to the sound of the CS game with a blank screen), and screen (watching the CS game without playing). Self-ratings of emotional responses were completed at pre-, during, and postgame. A significant decrease in the EEG AI was observed under the screen condition compared with baseline, whereas an increase was observed postgame compared with the screen condition. The participants demonstrated a positive EEG AI following the \"shoot\" events (shoot opponents) and negative emotions after the \"being shot\" events. Subjective ratings of emotional response indicated happiness during and postgame, but anger and arousal were reported only during the game. The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that predominantly positive emotional reactions are elicited from playing the CS game and concur with positive subjective ratings of happiness.

We might increase the benefits of participation in online support groups if we gain more insight into the factors that promote long-term commitment to peer support. One approach to foster the therapeutic potential of online support groups could be to increase social selection based on visual similarity. We performed a case study using the popular virtual setting of \"World of Warcraft\" (Blizzard Entertainment, Irvine, CA). We monitored the social dynamics of a virtual community composed of avatars whose appearance was identical during a period of 3 months, biweekly, for a total of 24 measures. We observed that this homogeneous community displayed a very high level of group stability over time in terms of the total number of members, the number of members that stayed the same, and the number of arrivals and departures, despite the fact that belonging to a heterogeneous group typically favors the success of the group with respect to game progression. Our results confirm that appearance can trigger social selection in online virtual communities.

For example, an increased emphasis on the dangers of tobacco use in employer and government communications has helped bring about a significant decrease in smoking. However, overall population health in key risk areas (such as obesity and diabetes) continues to decline. These areas are where employers can really make a difference in health outcomes-and effective communications are critical to success. Towers Watson helps many companies educate employees about health and wellness and encourage more effective use of healthcare. The challenge is to find new and engaging ways to deliver this information so that employees take notice-and take action.

To inform strategies aimed at reducing sedentary behavior by replacing non-active with active gaming, perceptions and context of active and non-active gaming are explored. Six focus groups were conducted with adolescents 12-16 years old representing a range of education levels. A semistructured question route was used containing questions about perceptions and the context of gaming. The adolescents had positive attitudes toward active gaming, especially the social interactive aspect, which was greatly appreciated. A substantial number of adolescents enjoyed non-active games more than active ones, mainly because of better game controls and more diversity in non-active games. Active games were primarily played when there was a social gathering. Few game-related rules and restrictions at home were reported. Given the positive attitudes of adolescents and the limited restrictions for gaming at home, active videogames may potentially be used in a home setting as a tool to reduce sedentary behavior. However, to make active games as appealing as non-active games, attention should be paid to the quality, diversity, and sustainability of active games, as these aspects are currently inferior to those of traditional non-active games.

There is a growing body of work addressing the health benefits of exergaming; however, there is limited knowledge concerning user experience in this new context. If we aim to encourage participation in exergaming, we must first understand why gamers currently play exergames. Exergaming refers to the computer games that require players to perform some level of physical exertion to play. For this reason, the present study compares the motivations that encourage participation in three contexts (exercise, computer games, and exergaming) to identify key elements that support such participation. Survey instruments were administered in each context, and motivational components were addressed within self-determination theory. Findings suggest perceptions of enjoyment and feeling better after a session and participation within a social context are key factors that encourage participation in the three contexts. Participation in exergaming is also encouraged by perceptions of performing mild exercise while playing videogames. Exergamers might not experience an optimal challenge while playing, and this may lower their motivation. Participation in exercise is also encouraged by perceptions of being healthier and, in some instances, driven to avoid feelings of guilt. Gamers also play computer games encouraged by perceptions being in a better mood after session, although some gamers might also participate aiming to gain social acceptance.

Videogames have potential for health promotion and may be especially promising when attempting to reach youth. An understudied characteristic of videogames is that many contain a narrative, or story. Story immersion (transportation) is a mechanism through which a narrative influences players' cognition, affect, and, potentially, health behavior.

For this initial stage, a qualitative focus group study was performed in three participating countries (Spain, The Netherlands, and Greece) where both games existing in the market and others developed in other European Commission projects like HERMES were presented to them, both on video presentations and also with the possibility to actually test some of them. Challenge, socialization, fun, providing learning opportunities, and escape from daily routine were extracted as the main keys why older people would be interested in playing digital games. Users described themselves as active and participating in many leisure activities, and this level of activity appeared to be related with the contents proposed for digital games, such as physical activity, culture, arts, and other human sciences (history, geography, traveling, foreign languages, music), and daily life skills (cooking, computer use, first aid).

Children over the 85th percentile for body mass index (BMI) and between 9 and 17 years old were randomly assigned to receive DDR+pedometers (treatment group) or pedometers only (comparison group). PA levels were tracked for 12 weeks by self-report, pedometer, and accelerometer data. Sixty-five families completed the study. The average BMI percentile of the participant was over 96 percent. Despite randomization, participants in the treatment (DDR) group were more often male, older, and heavier than participants in the comparison group. Self-reported frequency of moderate to vigorous PA increased significantly from baseline to 12 weeks for the treatment group and declined for the comparison group. Accelerometer results indicated a significant decline in moderate activity over time for the comparison group. However, there were no significant between-group differences based on the accelerometer or pedometer data. Based on self-report measures, DDR may have increased PA levels in obese and overweight children. However, we are led to question the validity of these results because analyses based on objective measures do not confirm them.

I am pleased to say that Debra, an Associate Editor of Games for Health Journal, is modest, cheerful, and a wealth of knowledge, and her story is both informative and enjoyable. ","574":"Dr. Shilling received his Doctor of Philosophy in Experimental Psychology (Auditory Psychophysics\/Neuroscience) from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1992 and his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at Wake Forest University in 1985. In 1993 he graduated with top honors from Aerospace Experimental Psychologist training-Naval Flight Surgeon Class 93002. In 1996, he served as an Assistant\/Associate Professor at the U.S. Air Force Academy in the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Leadership. In 2000, he arrived at the Naval Postgraduate School as an Associate Professor in the Operations Research and Systems Engineering Departments and became Technical Director for Immersive Technologies in the Modeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation Institute. His military decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal (three awards), the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Navy Achievement Medal. He is also the recipient of the American Hospital Association's 2009 Executive Award for Excellence. ","575":"","576":"Stories can serve as powerful tools for health interventions. Story immersion refers to the experience of being absorbed in a story. This is among the first studies to analyze story immersion's role in health videogames among children by addressing two main questions: Will children be more immersed when the main characters are similar to them? Do increased levels of immersion relate to more positive health outcomes? Eighty-seven 10-12-year-old African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic children from Houston, TX, played a health videogame, \"Escape from Diab\" (Archimage, Houston, TX), featuring a protagonist with both African-American and Hispanic phenotypic features. Children's demographic information, immersion, and health outcomes (i.e., preference, motivation, and self-efficacy) were recorded and then correlated and analyzed. African-American and Hispanic participants reported higher immersion scores than Caucasian participants (P = 0.01). Story immersion correlated positively (P values &lt; 0.03) with an increase in Fruit and Vegetable Preference (r = 0.27), Intrinsic Motivation for Water (r = 0.29), Vegetable Self-Efficacy (r = 0.24), and Physical Activity Self-Efficacy (r = 0.32). Ethnic similarity between videogame characters and players enhanced immersion and several health outcomes. Effectively embedding characters with similar phenotypic features to the target population in interactive health videogame narratives may be important when motivating children to adopt obesity prevention behaviors. ","577":"","578":"The field of games for health is growing rapidly, but many games for health are not validated for their use as a tool to improve outcomes. The few research studies that do exist are often poorly designed, and their conclusions cannot be considered valid evidence to support or refute efficacy. Based on lessons learned from the field of digital game-based learning in education and recent efforts to systematically review games for health in meta-analyses, guidelines are suggested for conducting high-quality efficacy studies on games for health. ","579":null,"580":null,"581":null,"582":"Registered dietitians are the nutrition experts in America. As such, their opinions about using technology-based nutrition games as teaching tools are important. The purpose of this study was to query registered dietitians about their experience and recommendations for topics, age, and platforms for future nutrition game development. The author gave a 1-hour talk to two state dietetic conference groups about nutrition games and their efficacy, concerns, and hopes and opportunities for their future as viable nutrition teaching tools. After the talks attendees completed a five-question survey about nutrition games, including if they played nutrition games, if they thought games could possibly help in their work, and preferences for topics, ages, and platforms for which they wanted to see priority development. Although only 4% of respondents played nutrition games, 79% thought they could be of benefit, and 21% felt that \"maybe\" they could be beneficial educational tools. Games on all nutrition topics were welcome, with preference for computers and smartphone apps. After a lengthy presentation on the new genre of technology-based nutrition games, registered dietitians reported that they are open to using technology-based nutrition education apps and feel they could have some benefit in educating the public about nutrition, even though dietitians presently have little experience with them. The talk was successful in informing dietitians about this new game genre, and their suggestions for topics, target ages, and tech platforms will be helpful to nutrition game developers and designers. ","583":null,"584":null,"585":"This study examines the effectiveness of \"Family of Heroes,\" an online avatar-based post-deployment stress and resiliency training simulation, in increasing families' engagement in motivating their veterans who exhibit signs of post-deployment stress, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and suicide ideation, to seek help at the Veterans Administration (VA). Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=50) that completed the online training and pre- and post-intervention and 1-month follow-up surveys or a control group (n=44) who only completed a pre-test and a 1-month follow-up survey. The experimental group exhibited significantly greater changes in its preparedness and likelihood to recognize signs of post-deployment stress and in approaching their veteran to discuss their concern and motivate them to seek help at the VA. This group also reported significant change in actual behavior in terms of discussing their concern with their veteran (79 percent approached to discuss vs. 56 percent for the control group). Finally, seven (22 percent) of the veterans who were approached by the experimental group started to receive mental health treatment (five at the VA). All seven were previously diagnosed with PTSD and\/or depression but never before started treatment at the VA. Results strongly suggest that \"Family of Heroes\" is an effective tool to engage families in taking an active role in motivating their veterans who exhibit signs of post-deployment stress to seek help at the VA. Results also suggest that the training can increase the actual number of veterans experiencing post-deployment stress who begin to receive treatment at the VA.
