purpose of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy of CT-guided microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of osteoid osteoma. Secondary objectives were to assess early outcome and side-effects of MWA. Twenty-eight consecutive patients (18 men, 10 women) with a median age of 19.5 years (IQR: 16, 25.5) with a total of 28 non-spinal osteoid osteoma treated by CT-guided MWA were retrospectively included. The ablations were performed with a median power and duration of 60 Watt and 1 min 30 s, respectively. Pain referred to osteoid osteoma was assessed at predefined time points using a 0-10 numeric rating scale. At one month, contrast-enhanced follow-up MRI was performed to evaluate the nidus vascularization and the volume of necrosis induced by MWA. Clinical success was defined by the absence of osteoid osteoma-related pain, and technical success was defined by the presence of necrosis of the nidus on the one-month post-MWA MRI. Long term success rate was 93% (26\/28) after a follow-up of 55.5 months (IQR: 25.75, 74.5) and technical success rate was 96 % (25\/26). One late failure was observed after a patient had been declared cured at one month but the formal proof of a late recurrence of osteoid osteoma could not be brought. Three minor complications were reported including mild reversible superficial radial nerve injury with a skin burn (grade 2) in one patient and moderate skin burn only in two patients. Our results suggest that CT-guided MWA is an effective option for a minimally-invasive treatment of osteoid osteoma with a low rate of complication and no late recurrence.

PHC is associated with a poor prognosis because of its insidious local spread that makes it challenging to diagnose and assess. Surgical resection remains the standard curative treatment (up to 50% 5-year overall survival after negative-margin resection). More aggressive surgical approaches have recently emerged, pushing the boundaries of PHC resectability at the cost of a higher morbidity. As such, adequate preoperative preparation (i.e., biliary drainage, venous embolization) is now regarded as a critical issue to increase the number of patients amenable to extended liver resection. Thorough imaging plays a pivotal role in the preoperative setting in both PHC resectability assessment and patient preparation to surgery. Despite recent improvement in PHC imaging, its assessment remains challenging and only 50-60% of patients who are scheduled to undergo surgery are ultimately amenable to curative resection. Therefore, a knowledge of available diagnostic and interventional imaging techniques is important to improve PHC management. Herein, we review the various imaging techniques and preoperative radiological interventions such as biliary drainage, portal vein embolization and liver venous deprivation that are available in PHC management focusing on the anatomical and oncological considerations that are crucial to prepare and guide curative surgical resection.","10":"","11":"","12":null,"13":"The purpose of this study was to make a systematic review of clinical studies evaluating software-based tumor margin assessment after percutaneous thermoablation (PTA) of liver tumors. A systematic literature search was performed through Pubmed\/MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Original studies published in English that reported on software-based assessment of ablation margins (AM) following PTA of liver tumors were selected. Studies were analyzed with respect to design, number of patients and tumors, tumor type, PTA technique, tumor size, target registration error, study outcome(s) (subtypes: feasibility, comparative, clinical impact, predictive or survival), and follow-up period. Twenty-nine articles (one multi-center and two prospective studies) were included. The majority were feasibility (26\/29, 89.7%) or predictive (23\/29, 79.3%) studies. AM was a risk factor of local tumor progression (LTP) in 25 studies (25\/29, 86.2%). In nine studies (9\/29, 31%) visual assessment overestimated AM compared with software-aided assessment. LTP occurred at the location of the thinnest margin in nine studies (9\/29, 31%). Time for registration and analysis was heterogeneously reported, ranging between 5-30 min. Mean target registration error was reported in seven studies (7\/29, 24.1%) at 1.62 mm (range: 1.20-2.23 mm). Inter-operator reproducibility was high (kappa range: 0.686-1). Ascites, liver deformation and inconspicuous tumor were major factors of co-registration error.

At this time of low disease burden, imaging and particularly magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\/CT) are essential to determine the localization of the recurrence, which may be local, in lymph nodes, and\/or metastatic. Imaging results allow best determine modalities of salvage treatment, which can be local by using radiotherapy or other focal treatments or systemic using hormonotherapy.

Reports of the CRAEs in radiology started in September 2019 after the team registration phase. Among the 89 CRAEs reported, 28 (31%) were targeted as interventional radiology, 27 (30%) as linked to contrast media and 11 (12%) as related to MRI care; the 23 other CRAEs reported included five defaults in the transmission of requests or results, five delays in diagnosis or treatment, four patient-identity monitoring events, four diagnostic radiology complications, four radiation protection events and one patient information problem. The severity was rated as \"minor\" for 53% of CRAEs and as \"serious to critical\" or \"catastrophic\" for 8% and 9% of CRAEs, respectively. They were preventable or probably preventable in 84% of all events. These early results of this nation-wide CRAEs declaration database show the diversity of all CRAEs and their causes in radiological practice in France, and provide a global vision of areas for improvement of the quality of care in radiology.

Careful analysis of imaging examinations can help identify the cause of the presenting symptoms and the mechanism of the complication. The complex surgical procedure used in ILE results in anatomical changes that make imaging interpretation challenging for many radiologists. The purpose of this review was to make radiologists more familiar with the imaging findings of normal anatomical changes and those of complications following ILE to enable accurate evaluation of patients with an altered postoperative course. Anastomotic leak, gastric conduit necrosis and pleuropulmonary complications are the most serious complications after ILE. Computed tomography used in conjunction with oral administration of contrast material is the preferred diagnostic tool, although it conveys limited sensitivity for the diagnosis of anastomotic fistula. In combination with early endoscopic assessment, it can also help early recognition of complications and appropriate therapeutic management.","57":"","58":null,"59":"The purpose of this study was to create a deep learning algorithm to infer the benign or malignant nature of breast nodules using two-dimensional B-mode ultrasound data initially marked as BI-RADS 3 and 4. An ensemble of mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask-RCNN) combining nodule segmentation and classification were trained to explicitly localize the nodule and generate a probability of the nodule to be malignant on two-dimensional B-mode ultrasound. These probabilities were aggregated at test time to produce final results. Resulting inferences were assessed using area under the curve (AUC). A total of 460 ultrasound images of breast nodules classified as BI-RADS 3 or 4 were included. There were 295 benign and 165 malignant breast nodules used for training and validation, and another 137 breast nodules images used for testing. As a part of the challenge, the distribution of benign and malignant breast nodules in the test database remained unknown. The obtained AUC was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57-0.82) on the training set and 0.67 on the test set.

Acquisitions on image quality and anthropomorphic phantoms were performed at six dose levels (CTDIvol: 10\/7.5\/5\/2.5\/1\/0.5mGy) on two CT scanners equipped with two different DLR algorithms (TrueFidelityTM and AiCE). Raw data were reconstructed using the filtered back-projection (FBP) and the lowest\/intermediate\/highest DLR levels (L-DLR\/M-DLR\/H-DLR) of each algorithm. Noise power spectrum, task-based transfer function (TTF) and detectability index (d') were computed: d' modelled detection of a soft tissue mediastinal nodule, ground-glass opacity, or high-contrast pulmonary lesion. Subjective image quality of anthropomorphic phantom images was analyzed by two radiologists. For the L-DLR\/M-DLR levels, the noise magnitude was lower with TrueFidelityTM than with AiCE from 2.5 to 10 mGy. For H-DLR, noise magnitude was lower with AiCE . For L-DLR and M-DLR, the average NPS spatial frequency (fav) values were greater for AiCE except for 0.5 mGy. For H-DLR levels, fav was greater for TrueFidelityTM than for AiCE. TTF50% values were greater with AiCE for the air insert, and lower than TrueFidelityTM for the polyethylene insert. From 2.5 to10 mGy, d' was greater for AiCE than for TrueFidelityTM for H-DLR for all lesions, but similar for L-DLR and M-DLR. Image quality was rated clinically appropriate for all levels of both algorithms, for dose from 2.5 to 10 mGy, except for L-DLR of AiCE. DLR algorithms reduce the image-noise and improve lesion detectability. Their operations and properties impacted both noise-texture and spatial resolution.

Endovascular coil or particle embolization of the superior rectal arteries, known as Emborrhoid technique, is a minimally invasive, image-guided therapy that targets the hemorrhoidal plexus and reduces hemorrhage. The purpose of this review was to analyze the results of published studies to determine the efficacy, clinical outcomes, and morbidities associated with the endovascular occlusion of hemorrhoidal arteries for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids. Current evidences suggest that hemorrhoids treated by Emborrhoid technique using microcoils, embolic particles or a combination is safe with no reported serious complications.

The goals were to propose innovative artificial intelligence solutions for the current relevant problems in radiology and to build a large database of multimodal medical images of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) on these subjects from several French radiology centers. This year the attempt was to create data challenge objectives in line with the clinical routine of radiologists, with less preprocessing of data and annotation, leaving a large part of the preprocessing task to the participating teams. The objectives were proposed by the different organizations depending on their core areas of expertise. A dedicated platform was used to upload the medical image data, to automatically anonymize the uploaded data. Three challenges were proposed including classification of benign or malignant breast nodules on ultrasound examinations, detection and contouring of pathological neck lymph nodes from cervical CT examinations and classification of calcium score on coronary calcifications from thoracic CT examinations. A total of 2076 medical examinations were included in the database for the three challenges, in three months, by 18 different centers, of which 12% were excluded. The 39 participants were divided into six multidisciplinary teams among which the coronary calcification score challenge was solved with a concordance index &gt; 95%, and the other two with scores of 67% (breast nodule classification) and 63% (neck lymph node calcifications).

Patients are usually both diagnosed and treated in infancy, however many of them may have subclinical CHD that remains undiagnosed until late adulthood. Patients with complex CHD tend to be symptomatic and are diagnosed at a younger age than those with a single defect. CHDs can be divided into three categories, including cardiac, great vessels and coronary artery anomalies. Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) technology with faster acquisition time and improved spatial resolution allow for detailed evaluation of cardiac morphology and function. The concomitant increased utilization of CT has simultaneously led to more sensitive detection and more thorough diagnosis of CHD. Recognition of and understanding the imaging attributes specific to each anomaly is important for radiologists in order to make a correct and definite diagnosis.

The Agatston score, the conventional CAC scoring, was then computed slice by slice from the resulting segmentation mask and compared to the ground truth manually estimated by radiologists. The quality of the estimation was assessed with the concordance index (C-index) on CAC risk category on a separate testing set of 98 independent CT examinations. The final model yielded a C-index of 0.951 on the testing set. The remaining errors of the method were mainly observed on small-size and\/or low-density calcifications, or calcifications located near the mitral valve or ring. The deep learning-based method proposed here to compute automatically the CAC score from unenhanced-ECG-gated cardiac CT is fast, robust and yields accuracy similar to those of other artificial intelligence methods, which could improve workflow efficiency, eliminating the time spent on manually selecting coronary calcifications to compute the Agatston score.

However, undifferentiated thyroid tumors have a lower avidity for radioiodine and the ability of DTC to concentrate 131I may be lost in metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography (PET)\/computed tomography (CT) has been introduced in the evaluation of patients with thyroid tumors and the 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyd-glucose (18F-FDG) has been largely validated as marker of cell's metabolism. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines, 18F-FDG PET\/CT is recommended in the follow-up of high-risk patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin and negative 131I imaging, in the assessment of metastatic patients, for lesion detection and risk stratification and in predicting the response to therapy. It should be considered that well-differentiated iodine avid lesions could not concentrate 18F-FDG, and a reciprocal pattern of iodine and 18F-FDG uptake has been observed. Beyond 18F-FDG, other tracers are available for PET imaging of thyroid tumors, such as Iodine-124 (124I), 18F-tetrafluoroborate and Gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen.

Forty-five athletes (39 men, 6 women; median age: 30 years, interquartile range: 23-42 years) prospectively underwent DSA and CTA without (n=5) or with (n=40) electrocardiogram gating. DSA was interpreted by a single expert (experience of 15 years). CTA was independently interpreted by three other readers (experience of 5-8 years). Readers assessed the presence and degree of stenoses on iliac and femoral arteries and the overall diagnosis (negative, uncertain, positive) of endofibrosis at the limb level. Sensitivities and specificities of DSA and CTA were estimated at the limb level using histological findings and long-term follow-up as reference, and compared using the McNemar test. For diagnosing and quantifying stenoses, concordance between DSA and CTA was moderate-to-good for common and external iliac arteries, moderate for lateral circumflex arteries and poor-to-moderate for the other branches of the deep femoral artery. It was good for all readers for the overall diagnosis of endofibrosis.

Each observer performed two series of 2D measurements and two series of 3D measurements (i.e., measurements derived from triplane volume processing). Measurements were converted into Z-scores according to gestational age. Variability between the different series of measurements was studied using Bland-Altmann plots and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Agreement with the 2D measurements of the senior observer was higher in 3D than in 2D for the junior observer (systematic differences of -0.4, -0.2 and -0.8 Z-score vs. -0.1, -0.1 and -0.6 for HC, AC and FL on 2D and 3D datasets, respectively).

This unique technique provides a dual benefit to patients screened for breast cancer. First, DBT increases the cancer detection rate mostly by highlighting architectural distortions and allowing better assessment of masses shape and margins. Second, DBT helps reduce recall rate by discarding asymmetries related to overlapping tissue. However, DBT is not included in the majority of cancer screening programs worldwide. Several issues still need to be addressed such as over-diagnosis and over-treatment, lack of reduction of interval breast cancer, quality control and storage, and radiation dose. In the diagnostic setting, DBT increases the diagnostic accuracy and reduces the number of indeterminate lesions in symptomatic women. Its aforementioned performances regarding asymmetries, masses and architectural distortions allow reducing the number of additional views while working-up a screening-detected lesion. Tumor size is also better assessed at DBT as well as multicentricity, two significant benefits in the staging of breast cancer. Finally, DBT allows a better analysis of scars and helps reduce the rate of indeterminate findings after surgery. Although somewhat limited by high breast density, DBT globally outperforms digital mammography in both screening and diagnostic breast imaging. Additional research is however needed, particularly on relevant screening outcomes.

Out of 1264 patients who underwent PECMO at our hospital between January 2009 and September 2018, we reviewed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of eight patients (4 men, 4 women; mean age, 54.9 years [range, 31-77 years]) who underwent percutaneous interventional treatment for bleeding complications secondary to percutaneous cannulation for PECMO. Both hemodynamic instability and coagulopathy were present in 7 patients who had direct injury during PECMO insertion and absent in one patient with pseudoaneurysm at the PECMO removal site. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided thrombin injection was performed in three patients with pseudoaneurysm of the common or superficial femoral artery, and adjunctive embolization was combined with microcoils or n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate in two of them. Stent graft was inserted in four patients with contrast extravasation (n=3) from external iliac artery (n=1) or common femoral or iliac veins (n=2) ruptures or the fistula between the superficial femoral artery and vein (n=1). N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate and coil embolization was performed for pseudoaneurysm from the internal pudendal artery branch in the remaining one patient. Technical success was achieved in all eight patients. There were no procedure-related complications. There was no rebleeding during the follow-up.

In contrast, deep bleeds in atypical locations can be a diagnostic challenge, since clinicians and radiologists are often unfamiliar with their clinical and radiological features. Some atypical bleeds, however, can be life-threatening or severely disabling, highlighting the need for prompt, accurate diagnosis. Rare bleeds include central nervous system bleeds (including intracranial and spinal hematomas), urogenital bleeds, intra-abdominal bleeds (mesenteric and gastrointestinal wall hematomas) and pseudo tumors in unusual locations like the sinonasal cavities. Because clinical assessment can be difficult, clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the possibility of these rare complications in their hemophilia patients, so that they can avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures and institute prompt, appropriate treatment. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the imaging features of bleeds that occur in rare locations in young (i.e., children and young adults) patients with hemophilia to make the reader more familiar with these conditions.","376":null,"377":"This purpose of this systematic review was to determine the safety and efficacy of arterial embolization as the primary treatment for grade III-V liver trauma, excluding the postoperative use of arterial embolization.

A total of 3855 patients (mean age, 33.5 years; range: 22-52.5 years) were treated non-operatively and 659 patients (659\/3855; 17.09%) with hepatic hemorrhage underwent primary arterial embolization from 2000 to 2017. Indication for arterial embolization was a contrast blush visible on computed tomography in hemodynamically stable patient in all studies. The arterial embolization success rate ranged from 80% to 97%. The most commonly reported complication was bile leak, with an incidence of 5.7%. Nineteen bilomas (2.8%) were reported in five studies with a range between 4% and 45%. Hepatic ischemia was reported in eight studies, with a mean incidence of 8.6%. Primary arterial embolization has a high success rate in patients with hepatic trauma. Complications, including biloma and hepatic ischemia, have acceptable rates in the context of a minimally-invasive procedure that allows stabilization of life-threatening, complex liver injuries.

Tumor evaluation using standard computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques does not account for the intra- or inter-tumoral heterogeneity in advanced ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. As such, computational approaches in assessing tumor heterogeneity have been proposed using radiomics and radiogenomics in order to analyze the whole tumor heterogeneity as opposed to single biopsy sampling. As part of radiomics, texture analysis, which includes the extraction of multiple data from images has been proposed recently to evaluate advanced ovarian tumor heterogeneity. In this short review, we explain the basics of radiomics, how to perform texture analysis, and its applications to ovarian cancer imaging.","379":null,"380":null,"381":"","382":"","383":null,"384":"In France, a national evaluation is given annually to radiology residents. The aim of this study was to perform both a docimological analysis of the quality of the questionnaire and a statistical analysis of the results. This retrospective study, which included French radiology residents from Year 1 to Year 5 of residency, was performed from 2015 to 2017 across 25 medical universities in France. Both qualitative and quantitative docimological analyses were performed as assessed by the Cronbach alpha coefficient, the difficulty of question (PDI), and the coefficient of discrimination (Rir). Results to the questionnaire were compared between years of residency. The results of the analysis confirmed the quality of the questionnaire (Cronbach alpha coefficient=0.71, mean [PDI=0.40]) though the majority of questions could be answered by memory rather than cognitive ability. The mean Rir was 0.02, indicating that students could not be certified using only the questionnaire. The results measuring resident level of knowledge were moderate, with mean results ranging from 9.2\/20 at the first year to 11.3\/20 at the fifth year of residency (P&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in results obtained between the third, fourth, and fifth year of residency but results were significantly different among university hospitals.

The CT examinations of 250 patients were used to train the machine learning software and 100 were used to validate the results. Each lung CT examination was divided into cervical, lung, and abdominal areas by the CNN and 2 independent radiologists, and the length of each area was measured. Every part above or below the lung marks was labeled as over-scanning. The accuracy of the CNN was calculated after the training phase and agreement between CNN and radiologists was assessed using kappa statistics during the validation phase. After validation the software was used to estimate the length of each of the three areas and the total over-scanning in further 1000 patients. An accuracy of 0.99 was found for the testing dataset and a very good agreement (kappa=0.98) between the CNN and the radiologists' evaluation was found for the validation dataset. Over-scanning was 22.8% with the CNN and 22.2% with the radiologists. The degree of over-scanning was 22.6% in 1000 lung CT examinations.

Its more widespread acceptance is limited by the cost of the use of MRI largely related to the long duration time of the procedures. However, the benefit of a robotic assistance has generated a new interest, because it substantially shortens the procedure time, while improving the accuracy. MRI-guided biopsy is considered as an appealing alternative to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided fusion biopsy, given the limitations of TRUS-MRI image registration systems. MRI-guided focal treatment also benefits from robotic assistance and from the unique property of MRI, which allows the measurement of the temperature in real-time during tumor ablation. The transrectal and transperineal approaches can be used and the respective indications of each pathway will depend on several factors, including the location of the tumor and the examination time, which will condition the occupation time of the MR room, a major factor influencing the overall cost of MRI-guided procedures.

In cases where there is an isolated adnexal lesion, without peritoneal disease or serum CA-125 elevation, and in lesions considered indeterminate on ultrasound, MR imaging with incorporation of the ADNEx MR score can increase the specificity for the diagnosis of benignity or malignancy.

There were 59 men and 26 women with a mean age of 62.4 years (range: 39-89 years). Patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed for procedural, historical, laboratory and imaging information. The imaging study was considered to have changed patients' clinical management if it resulted in the addition of a new procedure, canceling of a planned procedure or change in systemic therapy. The one-month post-treatment imaging findings led to management changes in 10 of 109 (9.2%) of treatments. When evaluated by cancer type, 2\/61 (3.3%) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatments had management changed while 8\/48 (16.7%) non-HCC treatments underwent management change (P=0.03). This difference was also significant at multivariate analysis (P=0.03; odds ratio: 0.17 [0.03-082]).

These images are parallel to the plane of the detector. Filtered back-projection or iterative reconstruction algorithms can be used to produce them. Iterative reconstruction used with a metal artifact reduction algorithm reduces metal artifacts, and therefore, improve image quality and in-depth spatial resolution. The radiation dose is lower compared to that of computed tomography and is two to three times the dose of a standard radiography. Tomosynthesis is intended for the analysis of high-contrast structures and especially for bones. It is superior to projection radiography when bone superimpositions are important or when metal structures hide regions of interest. The high in-plane resolution and its ability to perform exams in weight-bearing positioning are some of the main advantages of this technique. The impossible production of perpendicular multiplanar reconstruction and a limited contrast resolution are its main limitations. Tomosynthesis must be considered as an extension or an addition to standard radiography, as it can be performed in the same diagnostic step.

Three radiologists scored the effectiveness of fat suppression in bone marrow (EFSBM) and soft tissues (EFSST) in 20 joints per subject. One radiologist measured the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 10 bones per subject. Statistical analysis used two-way ANOVA with random effects (P&lt;0.0083), paired t-test (P&lt;0.05) and observed agreement to assess differences in effectiveness of fat suppression, differences in SNR and interobserver agreement. EFSBM was statistically significantly higher for the 3D FSPGR T1-weighted Dixon than for the 3D FSPGR T1-weighted CHESS sequence and the 3D FSE T1-weighted CHESS sequence (P&lt;0.0001).

Plain water, viscous fluid (30% ultrasound gel solution in water), or water\/viscous fluid with TVP were placed in collection bags and drained by gravity through each of the catheters and each connection. The flow rate was measured, recorded, and compared for each catheter and each connection as well as to the control flow rate of the catheters without connections. Ten one-minute trials were performed, and the mean flow rates were analyzed using Student t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Flow rate was significantly decreased in the 12-F and 14-F catheters with all stopcock and Luer-Lok connections with both water and viscous fluids. There was no significant reduction in flow for the 8.5-F and 10.2-F catheters with the 2.00-mm, 2.33-mm, and 2.67-mm connections; flow rate was significantly decreased in the 8.5-F and 10.2-F catheters with the 1.33-mm connection.

This review aims at helping radiologists to understand the basics of the up-to-date adenocarcinoma pathological classifications, radio-pathological correlations and how to use them in the clinical setting, as well as other imaging-related correlations (radiogenomics, quantitative analysis, PET-CT).","661":"","662":null,"663":"Pancreatic serous cystadenoma can be categorized into microcystic, honeycomb, oligocystic, and solid patterns based on imaging appearance.

Many technique-, treatment-, tumor- and patient-related factors influence the degree of injury sustained by the lung after irradiation. Based on the time interval after the completion of the treatment RILD presents as early and late features characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic changes, respectively. They are usually confined to the radiation port. Though the typical pattern of RILD is easily recognized after conventional two-dimensional radiation therapy (RT), RILD may present with atypical patterns after more recent types of three- or four-dimensional RT treatment. Three atypical patterns are reported: the modified conventional, the mass-like and the scar-like patterns. Knowledge of the various features and patterns of RILD is important for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. RILD should be differentiated from recurrent tumoral disease, infection and radiation-induced tumors. Due to RILD, the follow-up after RT may be difficult as response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria may be unreliable to assess tumor control particularly after stereotactic ablation RT (SABR). Long-term follow-up should be based on clinical examination and morphological and\/or functional investigations including CT, PET-CT, pulmonary functional tests, MRI and PET-MRI.","670":"Pancreatic ductal carcinoma is one of the deadliest cancers in the world.

As no gain in survival is expected in case of residual tumor, imaging plays a major role for diagnosis and staging to select patients who will undergo surgery.

The goal of this study was to compare multidetector row computerized tomographic angiography (MDCTA) with MRI for the visualization of vessels along each planned trajectory in patients who undergo SEEG. Ten consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo SEEG procedure were included. T1-weighted gadolinium-chelate enhanced MR sequence, stereotactic MDCT and MDCTA were performed after fixation of Leksell's frame. For each of the 106 planned stereotactic trajectories, the number of vessels in a 4.0mm diameter circle around the trajectory from the dura mater to the target that were visible on MDCTA were compared to that of visible vessels in the same areas on MRI. Ten vessels (10\/106; 9.4%) were seen on MRI and 66 (66\/106; 62.3%) on MDCTA (P&lt;0.0001). All vessels visible on MRI were visible on MDCTA. The difference in number of visible vessels between the two techniques remained significant for the different lobes (i.e., frontal lobe, temporal lobe and parieto-occipital lobe).

Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in six DBA\/1J mice at 12 weeks of age and three other DBA\/1J identical mice served as controls. Micro-CT images were acquired at baseline and at four, seven, and nine weeks post-induction. Disease was monitored via ROI analysis, and ROIs were first generated using semi-automated techniques.

There was a significant difference between the volume data comparison between the manually manipulated data and the semi-automated routine data across all time frames and across both humeri and femurs. There was no significant difference in densities calculated in Hounsfield units across any of the time frames, humeri or femurs, except for one time frame.

Breast specialists examining women with mastitis should proceed as follows: first, it is important to distinguish between cancer-related and non-cancer-related breast inflammation, since their clinical presentation can be misleading. Cancer-related mastitis reflecting the presence of aggressive cancer is less commonly observed than other forms of mastitis but its diagnosis, which can sometimes be difficult, needs to be made, or excluded, without delay.

Even so, a substantial number of women must undergo axillary lymphadenectomy during a second surgery when the analysis of the sentinel node discloses major nodal involvement. Imaging can improve patient selection, especially those who appear eligible for immediate axillary lymphadenectomy. Ultrasound is able to depict morphological abnormalities in the lymph nodes such as cortical thickening, peripheral vascularization, hilar infiltration and loss of the kidney-shaped appearance of a normal node. When ultrasound is negative, the risk of massive nodal involvement is limited, thus allowing the oncologist to take an approach with the sentinel lymph node procedure.

An endoleak can maintain a high systemic blood pressure within the aneurysm sac, potentially leading to rupture. Follow-up is therefore mandatory to detect and classify possible endoleaks. Computed tomography (CT) remains the gold standard for follow-up, but provides no hemodynamic information on endoleaks and has the disadvantages of exposing patients to iodine contrast and X-ray radiation. Exposure to radiation could be reduced in various ways, by simplifying the triphasic protocol using dual-energy CT imaging, limiting the amount of radiation per slice using iterative reconstruction, and reducing the follow-up schedule that could be altered to include non-ionizing radiation imaging techniques. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an interesting alternative to CT, as is magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that can be used as an alternative or for complementary imaging. Long-term follow-up schedules are currently based on repeated CT. However, more recently alternative follow-up protocols have been proposed for patients with no endoleaks nor increase in aneurysmal sac size.

Briefly, DCIR aims to save life while CEIR aims to control bleeding with a constant concern to time-awareness. This article also presents the concept of \"Prompt and Rapid Endovascular Strategies in Traumatic Occasions\" (PRESTO) that entirely oversees and manages trauma patients from arrival to the trauma bay until initial completion of hemostasis with endovascular techniques. PRESTO's \"Start soon and finish sooner\" relies on the earlier activation of interventional radiology team but also emphasizes on a rapid completion of hemostasis in which DCIR has been specifically tailored. Both DCIR and PRESTO expand the role of IR and represent a paradigm shift in the realm of trauma care.

Reliability of SWV measurements was assessed by means of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Reliability of the three independent SWV measurements was excellent, slightly better in the longitudinal plane. Inter\/intra-operator reproducibility per site was fair to good in the longitudinal plane and poor to fair in the transverse plane. For global values of the whole muscle, ICC showed good agreement in the longitudinal plane and fair agreement in the transverse plane.

Tumor diameter is currently the key factor to predict whether or not thermal ablation of HCC will be complete or not. It has now been shown for monopolar radiofrequency ablation that this therapy alone is sufficient to effectively treat single HCCs&lt;3cm in diameter provided that liver micrometastases are not present. If the HCC is&gt;3cm in size, multifocal or in the case of tumor recurrence, overall survival and recurrence-free survival results are better if monopolar radiofrequency ablation is combined with hepatic trans-arterial chemoembolization.

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value provides information on the movement of water molecules outside the cells. The literature contains many studies that have evaluated the role of DWI in musculoskeletal diseases. However, to date they yielded conflicting results on the use and the diagnostic capabilities of DWI in the area of musculoskeletal diseases. However, many of them have showed that DWI is a useful technique for the evaluation of the extent of the disease in a subset of musculoskeletal cancers. In terms of tissue characterization, DWI may be an adjunct to the more conventional MR imaging techniques but should be interpreted along with the signal of the lesion as observed on conventional sequences, especially in musculoskeletal cancers.

The CT scanner was upgraded after eight months (installation of iterative reconstruction and choice of an additional voltage of 100 kV). The system recorded, from DICOM image headers, the patient data and technical acquisition parameters. The statistical analysis compared the dose length products (DLP) before and after the upgrade, and compared them with the diagnostic reference levels (DRL). Four thousand seven hundred and ninety-five CT scans were included (2141 before the upgrade and 2654 after). For all of the acquisition protocols tested, there was a reduction in DLP after the upgrade. The mean reduction was 30%, with a range of 17% to 44% depending on the protocol.

This retrospective IRB-approved study included 75 patients who underwent standardised MRI with conventional sequences (T1- and T2-weighted images, and T1 post-contrast sequences with fat saturation) and functional sequences: diffusion (b0, b1000) and perfusion MR. Two independent readers reviewed the images using the decisional algorithm. The conclusion of each reader was: the lesion is or is not a Warthin's tumor.

","1029":"Because of its excellent sensitivity and specificity to diagnose arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in the acute phase, MRI answers the main questions to guide treatment in \"candidates\" for thrombolysis. It lasts less than ten minutes, can confirm the diagnosis of AIS and distinguish it from hematomas and other \"stroke mimics\". It can identify the ischemic penumbra (perfusion-diffusion mismatch), determine the site of occlusion and provide prognostic information to adapt treatment in some cases in which the indications are poorly defined. In light of the most recent scientific findings, MRI can guide the treatment turning it into the investigation of choice in \"candidates\" for thrombolysis. ","1030":"","1031":"Compare tomosynthesis to mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and histology for the detection and staging of BI-RADS 4-5 anomalies, as a function of breast composition, lesion location, size, and histology. Seventy-five patients underwent mammography, tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and MRI. The diagnostic accuracy of the different examinations was compared. The sensitivities for detection were as follows: 92.5% with MRI, 79% for ultrasound, 75% for tomosynthesis, and 59.5% for mammography. Tomosynthesis improves the sensitivity of mammography (P=0.00013), but not the specificity. The detection of multifocality and multicentricity was improved, but not significantly. Tomosynthesis identified more lesions than mammography in 10% of cases and improved lesion staging irrespective of the density, but was still inferior to MRI. The detection of ductal neoplasia was superior with tomosynthesis than with mammography (P=0.016), but this was not the case with lobular cancer. The visualization of masses was improved with tomosynthesis (P=0.00012), but not microcalcifications. Tomosynthesis was capable of differentiating lesions of all sizes, but the smaller lesions were easier to see. Lesion sizes measured with tomosynthesis, excluding the spicules, concurred with histological dimensions. Spicules lead to an overestimation of the size. In our series, tomosynthesis found more lesions than mammography in 10% of patients, resulting in an adaption of the surgical plan. ","1032":"Recent advances need to be highlighted in the management of both localized and metastatic prostate cancer. New early detection and molecular characterization tools are being developed to improve differentiation of their progression profiles and reduce \"overdetection\" and \"overtreatment\" of clinically \"insignificant\" cancers. In addition, the development of multi-parametric MR has improved the characterization of localized cancer and introduced the new concept of focal treatment. Finally, several treatments for metastatic cancer which is resistant to castration have recently increased the therapeutic armamentarium. ","1033":"Multiparametric MR of the prostate provides an extremely accurate diagnosis and offers an excellent negative predictive value for cancers which biopsies struggle to detect. Combined with biopsies they consolidate both positive and negative biopsy results and allow patients to be offered more appropriate treatments (active monitoring, radical treatment in full knowledge of the topography of the lesions involved, or local treatment, etc.). The investigation does not require advanced equipment and can be carried out in any MR centre although it needs to follow a technical protocol described in the European guidelines (ESUR 2012). Interpretation should be standardized to facilitate communication of clear and consistent information between practitioners. ","1034":"Imaging-guided percutaneous biopsies in patients in oncology provide an accurate diagnosis of malignant tumors. Percutaneous biopsy results are improved by correct use of sampling procedures. The risks of percutaneous biopsy are low and its complications are generally moderate. These risks can be reduced using aids such as blund tip introducers, hydrodissection and correct patient positioning. The multidisciplinary team meetings dialogue between oncologist, surgeon and radiologist correctly defines the indications in order to improve the treatment strategies.","1035":"Lung cancer (LC) is a major public health issue because of its frequency, but especially because of the severity of this disease. The epidemiology has changed with an increased incidence in non-smokers and women. The ATS\/ERS\/IASLC classification of adenocarcinomas was modified in 2011, and they are now the most frequent histological subtype. More than half the cases of LC are diagnosed at the metastatic stage. Biopsies must provide tissue samples that are quantitatively large enough and of a good enough quality for diagnosis and to search for biomarkers. When the cancer seems to be localized, precise staging must be obtained. Treatment is based on the TNM classification. In localized stages, lobectomy associated with lymph node dissection is the standard therapy. Intraoperative chemotherapy improves survival in case of lymph node infiltration. Stereotactic radiation therapy and radiofrequency can be considered as specific cases. In cases with local progression, treatment is more controversial. In the presence of metastases, the goal is not a cure, but improving survival and quality of life. Numerous advances have been made with personalized treatment, (in particular in relation to the histological type and oncogenic addiction in tumors, access to new drugs, and improved management). Clinical research in thoracic cancer is very active. The fight against tobacco should remain a priority.","1036":"","1037":"Cerebral metastases are the commonest central nervous system tumors. The MR assessment should include T1-weighted images with and without enhancement and T2\/FLAIR images. They usually appear as multiple lesions with nodular or annular enhancement and are surrounded by edema. They are hypervascularized and have no restriction of their diffusion coefficient in their necrotic area and contain lipids on 1H spectroscopy. Metastases can be distinguished from primary tumors by the lack of malignant cell infiltration around the tumor. Stereotactic radiotherapy may temporarily increase tumor volume, although this is not of adverse oncological value. Less commonly, spinal disease may be asymptomatic and should be examined by MR.","1038":"In the assessment of lung cancer, computed tomography guides the use of bronchoscopy and establishes whether local treatment may be appropriate for the NSCLC or whether it is at an advanced stage. Percutaneous biopsy of a lesion suspected to be a metastasis can provide histological confirmation, allowing staging to be carried out at the same time. The initial presentation depends on the staging and histological type, ranging from an isolated nodule or mass to atelectasis or obstructive pneumonia, isolated lymph node disease or isolated pleural effusion to miliary metastasis in tumors showing EGFR mutation. Tumor (T) status depends on tumor size, distance from the carina, and invasion of the chest wall and mediastinal organs. PET-CT is superior to CT in identifying lymph node invasion (N2 for ipsilateral mediastinal disease and N3 for contralateral or supraclavicular disease). As a general rule, all contraindications for surgery should be confirmed via histological examination, with the exception of cerebral metastases.","1039":"","1040":"We report the case of five patients referred to our department with Hoffa's disease: three patients were at the initial stage of the disease and the two others had reached the chronic stage. This condition is one of the less well-documented causes of pain in the anterior compartment of the knee. The pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear. It is probably caused by repetitive micro trauma resulting in inflammatory, haemorrhagic and fibrous changes to Hoffa's fat pad. The final outcome of the disease is an osteochondroma. The diagnosis is established by MRI, which demonstrates inflammation of the fat pat. At the chronic stage, a standard X-ray is sufficient to demonstrate ossification of the fat pad.","1041":"Standardized terminology developed by the American College of Radiography (ACR) through the Breast-Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon is used worldwide to describe the findings of the various breast-imaging techniques (mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). A 7-level positive predictive value (PPV) of malignancy classification system (from BI-RADS category 0 to category 6) has been based on this terminology, giving imaging a central role in the diagnostic strategy. This document presents the standardized, compulsory BI-RADS terminology used in breast-imaging reports in 2013 in view of the new edition that will be published at the end of the year. ","1042":"Percutaneous ablation (radiofrequency or cryotherapy) of bone tumors is most often performed for palliative purposes. Many studies have shown that percutaneous ablation of a painful bone metastasis can significantly and sustainably reduce symptoms. It is therefore an alternative to radiotherapy and to long-term opiates. Percutaneous ablation can also be performed for curative purposes. In this situation, its efficacy has however only been studied to a very small extent (apart from radiofrequency ablation of osteoid osteomas in which the success rate is almost 100%). In our experience, the success rate after radiofrequency ablation of a bone metastasis is 75% if it is less than 3cm in diameter and fall significantly over this (to 40%, P=0.04). This treatment can therefore be justified in oligometastatic patients whose disease is progressing slowly. Its benefit on survival has however not been assessed in this selected population. Whether it is performed for palliative or curative reasons, percutaneous ablation should ideally be followed by an injection of cement if the metastasis being treated is lytic and located in a bone, which is subject to mechanical forces. The aim of consolidating cementoplasty is to counterbalance the additional risk of fracture due to destruction of the percutaneously ablated bone.","1043":"Detecting a new area of contrast-enhancement at MRI after irradiation of malignant brain tumor arises the problem of differential diagnosis between tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis induced by the treatment. The challenge for imaging is to distinguish the two diagnoses given: the prognostic and therapeutic issues. Various criteria have been proposed in the literature based on morphological, functional or metabolic MRI. The purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of these tools to identify MRI best criteria to differentiate radiation necrosis lesions from malignant gliomas and brain metastases recurrence. For gliomas, the morphology of the contrast-enhancement cannot guide the diagnosis and the use of perfusion techniques and spectroscopy (multivoxels if possible) are necessary. In the follow-up of metastasis, a transient increase and moderate lesion volume is possible with a good prognosis. Morphological characteristics (volume ratio T2\/T1Gd) and perfusion analysis provide valuable tools for approaching the diagnosis of radionecrosis. ","1044":"We report the results of combining cardiac and hepatic MRI in the same examination to monitor 48 multi-transfused patients presenting iron overload secondary to their transfusions. This cardiac MRI technique uses acquisition sequences and calculation software that are readily available for 1.5 T systems, and it has been validated to screen for patients at risk of cardiac complications who present myocardial iron overload (T2*&lt;20milliseconds). A total of 176 combined MRI examinations were performed between May 2006 and January 2012 in 48 patients who had received transfusions due to thalassaemia. This monocentric retrospective study brings together all of the imaging examinations carried out. There was a positive correlation between the cardiac T2* values and left ventricular ejection fraction, which were measured in the same examination. At the first assessment 23\/48 patients had a T2*&lt;20ms. These patients showed a significant improvement in cardiac T2* over time while their iron chelation therapy was being intensified. This study validates the application of the cardiac MRI technique used to monitor cardiac iron overload in patients who have undergone multiple transfusions. ","1045":"More than 90% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma occur on the background of chronic liver disease. Its diagnosis should therefore be based on six-month ultrasound screening, which should be started in these patients. The positive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is based on its vascularization examined on dynamic CT or MRI images after contrast enhancement. Arterial hypervascularization followed by a washout from the lesion in the portal and\/or late phases on a background of cirrhosis provides a positive diagnosis of HCC without histology for nodules over a centimeter in size (international guidelines). Any other appearances require needle biopsy of the nodule and extra-nodular area to confirm the diagnosis. The local staging assessment predominantly involving portal invasion and the general patient assessment should be combined with assessment of the underlying liver disease to guide the treatment decision. The information obtained should be contained in as standardized a report as possible with all of the information required for patient management.","1046":"Fast scanning along with high resolution of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) have expanded the role of non-invasive imaging of splanchnic arteries. Advancements in both MDCT scanner technology and three-dimensional (3D) imaging software provide a unique opportunity for non-invasive investigation of splanchnic arteries. Although standard axial computed tomography (CT) images allow identification of splanchnic arteries, visualization of small or distal branches is often limited. Similarly, a comprehensive assessment of the complex anatomy of splanchnic arteries is often beyond the reach of axial images. However, the submillimeter collimation that can be achieved with MDCT scanners now allows the acquisition of true isotropic data so that a high spatial resolution is now maintained in any imaging plane and in 3D mode. This ability to visualize the complex network of splanchnic arteries using 3D rendering and multiplanar reconstruction is of major importance for an optimal analysis in many situations. The purpose of this review is to discuss and illustrate the role of 3D MDCT angiography in the detection and assessment of abnormalities of splanchnic arteries as well as the limitations of the different reconstruction techniques. ","1047":"Most methods define a limited number of \"target\" lesions to be measured and other \"non-target\" lesions to be evaluated qualitatively. RECIST criteria are the most widely used although other criteria have been proposed that are derived from them based on size alone, or size and attenuation. Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria only concern hepatocellular carcinoma and only take into account the viable portion (enhanced after injection during the arterial phase). Cheson criteria are more complex as target lesions are defined differently depending on the organ (lymph nodes, liver or spleen, other organs), and involve both CT and PET scans, as well as the clinical examination and bone marrow biopsy. ","1048":"","1049":"Although metastatic disease indicates diffusion of a cancer at a distance from its site of origin, in some cases pulmonary and hepatic metastases are isolated and slowly progressive, making them suitable for local treatment. Thermo-ablation techniques are associated with low morbidity and reduced collateral parenchymal damage; they therefore play an important role in such patients, where the disease is slow and chronic, requiring repeated local treatments. Unlike radiotherapy, a second treatment is possible in the event of local failure. ","1050":"While depiction and definition of morphological and architectural characteristics of CNS vascular disorders remains the first step of an MR analysis, emerging imaging techniques offer new functional information that might help to characterize rupture risk of CNS vascular disorders. Two main orientations are suggested by recent studies: inflammation of the vessel wall and analysis of physical constraints of blood flow using 4D flow imaging (shear parietal). This paper will focus on radiological application of 4D flow imaging and inflammation imaging, in the characterization of potential prognostic markers of CNS vascular disorders. We will review the basic technical considerations of 4D flow MRA, inflammation imaging and discuss their applications in CNS vascular disorders: aneurysms, arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistulas. We will illustrate their potential in the development of individual rupture risk criteria in brain vascular disorders. ","1051":"To determine the diagnosis performance of shear wave elastography in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions and the factors influencing the elasticity values. To suggest an appropriate management of breast lesions using the ultrasound-elastography combination. Monocentric retrospective study of 167 breast lesions classified by conventional ultrasound as BI-RADS category 3 or higher that underwent an elastography study and histological analysis. The analysis of qualitative parameters, according to the classification established in this study, allows us to obtain a sensitivity of 91.1% and a specificity of 92.3%. These values are very close to or better than the quantitative parameters Emax and Emean. Different Emax thresholds values were established based on the long axis of the lesion and its palpable character, which appeared to be significant factors influencing elasticity. The management of breast lesions by combining ultrasound and elastography, as proposed here, allows us to keep the sensitivity of an ultrasound (96%), while doubling its specificity (86.2% versus 43.1%). With the complementary nature of their performance, the combination of conventional ultrasound and shear wave elastography can improve the management of breast lesions. The qualitative classification proposed appears to be relevant assistance in lesion characterization. ","1052":"Examination of ligament reconstructions, particularly of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), are common situations in everyday knee imaging practice. Knowledge of normal appearances, the expected changes over time and the potential complications of these plasties are essential. MRI is the imaging method of choice. This article illustrates the main complications specific to this procedure: suboptimal positioning of the femoral or tibial tunnels, impingement between the graft and bony contours, rupture (partial or complete) of the plasty due to friction or injury, arthrofibrosis and particularly the \"Cyclops\" syndrome, fragmentation or migration of the fixation materials and a granulomatous reaction to biomaterials. ","1053":"Targeted therapies have considerably improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic renal cancer (mRCC) but there are no reliable response assessment criteria reflecting the clinical benefits, because there is no regression in size, or it is delayed. Such criteria would help early identification of non-responders, who would then benefit from a change of treatment, and would avoid their being subjected to unnecessary side effects related to the treatment. We will review the imaging techniques currently available for evaluating tumour response in mRCC patients, including the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), the Choi criteria, the modified Choi criteria, and the CT size and attenuation criteria (SACT). We will also discuss functional imaging techniques, which are based on the physiological characteristics of the tumours, such as perfusion CT, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound (DCE-CT, DCE-MRI, DCE-US), diffusion MRI, BOLD MRI and new positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. It is not possible at present to propose a unanimously acknowledged criterion for evaluating tumour response to targeted therapy. However, there is a real need for this according to oncologists and the pharmaceutical industry, and radiologists need to be involved in reflecting on the subject.

A prospective study comparing the results of the pelvimetry of 18 dry pelvises carried out on the EOS imaging system to measurements taken manually and using the two current gold standard CT methods. Pelvimetric measurements of each pelvic bone were obtained using four methods and compared: direct manual measurements, spiral and sequential CT pelvimetry, and 2D-3D low-dose biplanar X-rays. The various obstetric diameters were measured to the millimetre and compared. There was no significant difference in the different diameters assessed, with the exception of the interspinous diameter. There was a highly significant correlation (P &lt; 0.001) between the values measured manually and by EOS for the Magnin index (Pearson = 0.98), the obstetric conjugate diameter (Pearson = 0.99), and the median transverse diameter (Pearson = 0.87). The EOS imaging system allows for an ex vivo determination of the obstetrical diameters that is reliable enough to estimate obstetric prognosis, producing comparable measurements to CT. In view of concerns about protection from radiation, this low-dose imaging technique could become, after in vivo prospective validation, the new gold standard for pelvimetry and therefore a good alternative to CT.

As a result of the widening range of both techniques and technologies these treatments have gradually become incorporated into increasingly complex treatment strategies for increasingly broad patient groups. The place reserved for these techniques, which are still dominated by monopolar radiofrequency ablation, which is now facing strong competition from second-generation microwaves, is governed by each center's knowledge and skills in the techniques.

This enables high radiation doses to be delivered, sparing the surrounding non-malignant liver parenchyma. Most of the complications are caused by unexpected particles passing into the gastrointestinal tract through branches originating from the main hepatic arterial supply.

Severe bleeding can arise as a result of radiation cystitis, bladder carcinoma, cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, severe infection, transurethral resection of the prostate and prostate cancer. When irrigation of the bladder through a three-way catheter and fulguration of the bleeding lesions fail to stop the hematuria, a life-threatening situation can develop, when blood transfusion fails to keep pace with the rate of blood loss.

The following parameters were assessed and compared to a normal contralateral muscle: maximum thickness, volume, and Goutallier's classification grade of fatty infiltration of the piriformis and internal obturator muscles. Pain was assessed through a visual analogue scale (VAS). The untreated patients had no significant difference in the volume (P=1.0) or thickness of the piriformis muscle (P=0.61).

We report four consecutive patients with massive hemorrhage after PN, treated by arterial embolization and review the literature to discuss the clinical presentation, imaging evaluation and clinical outcome. All patients developed arteriovenous fistula and one a pseudoaneurysm. After selective catheterization and identification of the bleeding site, we used microcoils as embolization material.

Enhancement curve morphology of the osteoid osteomas was significantly different from its mimickers. All osteoid osteomas had an early enhancement with a delay between nidus and arterial peak below 30 seconds. Eighty percent of the mimickers demonstrated a slow and progressive enhancement. The perfusion parameters of the other lytic bone lesions were similar to those of the osteoid osteomas in 46.1% of the patients.

The fibrovascular stalks of the papilloma accounts for the Doppler flow. Certain secretory forms of intra-ductal carcinoma may distend the structure of the milk ducts.

Round or oval masses are benign when their margins are circumscribed (fibroadenoma, intramammary lymph node); on the other hand, with non-circumscribed margins (microlobulated or irregular), masses that are round or oval may be cancers. Seven histological types of round cancers have been identified: grade III invasive ductal carcinoma, colloid or mucinous carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, intramammary metastases, intracystic papillary carcinoma, lymphoma and high-grade phyllodes tumors.

It shows that there is a specific MRI profile for triple-negative cancers: distinct demarcation, regular edges, hyperintensity on T2 weighted signals and, particularly, a crown enhancement. It is important for the radiologist to understand this molecular classification, firstly because of the relatively suggestive appearance of triple-negative basal-like cancers in the molecular classification, secondly, and particularly, as cancers in patients with the BRCA1 mutation are often triple-negative meaning that the criteria for reading the MRI needs to be tailored to this feature of the cancers, and finally because the efficacy of MRI in assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy depends on the molecular class of cancer treated.

This is also the case of polymorphous fine and linear fine microcalcifications most often, but not exclusively, associated with DCIS with necrosis. For other types of microcalcifications, other parameters are analyzed in a more global approach: the associated clinical or mammographical signs; the context, especially genetic; the spatial distribution; the number; the evolution over time.

The objectives of our study were to analyse the displacement of targets between MRI and ultrasound; to define discriminating BIRADS morphological criteria to predict benign or malignant character and better establish the indications of second look ultrasound and biopsy; and to analyse the agreement between ultrasound and MRI in terms of morphological criteria. A retrospective and monocentric review was performed of the records of consecutive patients with breast abnormalities (mass or non-mass) initially detected by MRI that were not initially seen on mammography or ultrasound. All patients with abnormalities found during the performance of second look ultrasound and biopsied were included in the study. All lesions were documented using the BIRADS lexicon for MRI and ultrasound. Of 100 included patients, 108 lesions were detected by MRI, found via second look ultrasound and biopsied between January 2008 and 2010. All of the included patients were followed-up for a variable period, from 2 to 5 years. Eighty-two upon 108 biopsied lesions (76%) were benign and 26\/108 lesions (24%) were malignant. This study confirmed the switch from procubitus to decubitus essentially displaces the tumour in the antero-posterior direction. It showed that the risk factors were not reliable criteria for establishing an indication for second look ultrasound. This study also showed that circumscribed contours and a progressive enhancement curve (type I) for masses on MRI had the strongest negative predictive value of greater than 0.85. In ultrasound, the round or oval shape, circumscribed contours and the parallel orientation to the skin favoured benignity with a NPV of greater than 0.85. For masses, the study showed that the agreement in interpretation of the benign versus suspicious morphological criteria between the MRI and the ultrasound was very weak for the shape (Kappa=0.09) and weak for the contours (Kappa=0.23). Finally, the MRI overestimated the size of the targets compared to ultrasound (Student t-test, p=0.0001). The performance of second look ultrasound has to be performed after the detection of an abdnormality on MRI even for lesion classified BIRADS 3.

Generally, imaging is recommended to confirm the clinical diagnosis, investigate the etiology, and grade the extend and severity of the acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality in most centers for the confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and the ruling out of other causes of acute abdomen, but it has limitations in the acute clinical setting. Computed tomography not only establishes the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, but also enables to stage severity of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has earned an ever more important role in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. It is especially useful for imaging of patients with iodine allergies, characterizing collections and assessment of an abnormal or disconnected pancreatic duct.

Neurologic complications were quantified by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and were evaluated by median Rankin Scale (mRS). To evaluate the influence of experience of the operator to perform CAS, we retrospectively analyzed periprocedural and neurological complications of the first 50 procedures compared with that of the following 59 interventions.

Treatments generally included surgery (61.7% mastectomies), radiotherapy (96%) and chemotherapy (79.6%). Overall 5-year survival was 81.8%. PABC is an uncommon but aggressive form of breast cancer and must be considered in the presence of any breast abnormality during pregnancy or the months following delivery.

From analysis of the literature and particularly independent reviews published in 2012, we provide some answers for doctors faced with the legitimate concerns of women. These studies confirm that screening in the right age group reduces specific mortality by at least 20% at a cost of overdiagnosis estimated at between 1 and 15%. ","1138":"The semiological description of masses in mammography is based on the BI-RADS system provided by the American College of Radiology. The contour is the most discriminating morphological criterion between benign and malignant masses. Most circumscribed masses are benign. Nevertheless, due to specific histological characteristics, certain malignant lesions or lesions with a risk of malignancy may appear in the mammography in this falsely reassuring form. An indistinct contour in the mammography is suspicious and requires a tissue sample. The positive predictive value of malignancy varies according to the morphology of the contour. It is lower for microlobulated contours, increases for masked, then indistinct contours and reaches 96% for spiculated contours. However, in rare cases, certain benign lesions may appear in the form of spiculated masses. In these specific cases, a correlation between the histological results with the imaging data is essential in order to avoid failing to recognise an underlying malignant lesion that the biopsy may have underestimated.

Validating the procedure poses a new problem because the signal targeted is created by the injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent and is thus transitory. In the first instance, the procedure is validated by the radiologist, who checks that targeting is accurate and inserts a clip at the end of the procedure, and secondly by analysis of the histopathological results, which should be representative of the lesion. The pathologist needs to know the nature of the image, i.e. whether it is of mass or non-masslike enhancement, and its BI-RADS classification. The objective is that the image and the pathological result should concur. If the result is non-specific and benign, a follow-up MRI is required six months later.

Four histologically proven FNH-sd nodules in four patients were investigated with both MRI and CEUS imaging. Sinusoidal dilatation was focally visible in all cases in histology. In MRI, in all the four cases, lesions were hypervascular in arterial phase, with high intensity in T2-weighted sequence imaging and persistent enhancement in the delayed gadolinium-enhanced phase. These MRI features were more indicative of HCA than FNH. On the other hand, CEUS showed a very specific centrifugal filling followed by a strong, homogeneous enhancement of the whole lesion.

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze whether pre-therapeutic (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET\/CT is able to predict response to Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT). Forty patients with advanced stage NET were treated with a fixed dose of (90)Y-DOTATOC (5550 or 3700MBq). Prior to PRRT, each patient received (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET\/CT. Treatment results were evaluated after 3months by CT, tumor marker levels and clinical course and correlated with (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake (SUVmax) and the assumed uptake of (90)Y-DOTATOC in tumor manifestations (MBq\/g).

The signal, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared for three regions of interest, including the kidney, psoas and abdominal fat. The signal in each region of interest was not modified based on the type of reconstruction. The noise level decreased significantly during the passage from the FBP to SAFIRE, as well as with the increase in the SAFIRE level. The SNR and CNR therefore increased with the use of iterative reconstructions. The increase in noise observed between the acquisition at -30% and that at -70% was compensated by the use of higher SAFIRE levels. Iterative reconstructions can be used to improve the SNR and CNR at a constant dose or to reduce the dose by keeping the same SNR and CNR on abdominal CT images.

They then show that certain atypical features should be known in order to establish a diagnosis. They also observe the potential interactions between the haemangioma, an active vascular lesion, and the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. Finally, they discuss the specific paediatric features of hepatic haemangiomas and illustrate the case of a hepatic angiosarcoma.

Only computer tomography can provide the answers to these different questions. The aim of this paper is to provide a reminder of the CT signs that enable us to confirm diagnosis of the various aspects of mechanical occlusion of the stomach and duodenum, small intestine or colon, to emphasize and illustrate the diagnostic traps in CT and to set out the key points of a CT report of mechanical occlusion.

CS lesions may arise from different components of the CS or from adjacent structures and spaces. They can be classified as tumoral, inflammatory\/infectious, vascular and congenital. Tumoral lesions include benign (meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, schwannomas) and malignant neoplasms (chondrosarcomas, chordomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, leukemia, metastases). Inflammatory\/infectious conditions comprise: Tolosa Hunt, abscess, Lemierre syndrome and thrombophlebitis. Vascular lesions include: hemangiomas, carotido-cavernous fistula, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations. Congenital conditions include the epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst and fatty deposits. Although imaging features of non-vascular CS diseases are most often non-specific, careful analysis of the adjacent structures suggests the correct diagnosis.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) may either rupture, and lead to life-threatening hemoptysis\/hemothorax or be responsible for a right-to-left shunting leading to paradoxical embolism, causing stroke or cerebral abscess. PAVMs patients should systematically be screened as the spontaneous complication rate is high, by reaching almost 50%. Neurological complications rate is considerably higher in patients presenting with diffuse pulmonary involvement. PAVM diagnosis is mainly based upon transthoracic contrast echocardiography and CT scanner examination. The latter also allows the planification of treatments to adopt, which consists of percutaneous embolization, having replaced surgery in most of the cases. The anchor technique consists of percutaneous coil embolization of the afferent pulmonary arteries of the PAVM, by firstly placing a coil into a small afferent arterial branch closely upstream the PAVM. Enhanced contrast CT scanner is the key follow-up examination that depicts the PAVM enlargement, indicating the various mechanisms of PAVM reperfusion. When performed by experienced operators as the prime treatment, percutaneous embolization of PAVMs, is a safe, efficient and sustained therapy in the great majority of HHT patients.

The aim of this paper is therefore: to explain how to explore a clinical and laboratory picture of biliary obstruction using imaging, by presenting its main causes, the methods of exploring them and their radiological signs; to suggest suitable exploration strategies; and to illustrate some of the traps that can make it difficult to diagnose the cause of the obstruction.

However, an imaging procedure which is not suitable for the clinical situation and an examination performed with the wrong protocol are sources of error and must be avoided. Anatomical variants, inflammatory cancers, complicated forms (perforation, secondary occlusion of the small intestine, peripheral abscesses, fistulae, pylephlebitis, liver abscesses) and associated signs related to a peritoneal inflammatory reaction (reflex ileus, reactive ileitis or salpingitis) can also lead to a wrong diagnosis.

In contrast, pseudotumoral forms of inflammation (chronic pancreatitis, cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas, autoimmune pancreatitis) may simulate a cancer, and make up 5-10% of the surgical procedures for suspected cancer.

","1236":"There are many limitations to the examination of the bile ducts by magnetic resonance imaging, which may be four orders: (1) technical, requiring analysis of Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) three-dimensional (3D) volume reconstructions as well as native images, the use of T1-weighted sequences obtained in 3D to avoid entry slice phenomena, and knowledge of the inherent limits of the method, the spatial resolution of which is still less than optimal; (2) anatomical: you need to know the appearance of flow artefacts within the bile ducts and the traps that the presence of air or bleeding into the bile ducts can create; you also need to know the characteristic appearance of the indentation caused by the hepatic artery on the bile ducts and the variants and modifications seen in cases of portal biliopathy; (3) semiological: the terms used to describe bile duct abnormalities seen in MRI are often derived from imprecise descriptions used in retrograde cholangiography: irregularities of the bile ducts, a beaded 'string of pearls' appearance, a 'dead tree' appearance; (4) related to a complex disease, cholangitis which is a complex pathological condition, with possible overlaps between different conditions, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), secondary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune cholangitis. In any case, the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma associated with PSC is always difficult. These limitations can be circumvented by using a precise exploration technique comprised of 3D magnetic resonance cholangiography sequences, which allow volume analysis, examination of native slices and of thick or thin MIP reconstructions, and heavily T2-weighted and T1-weighted 3D sequences with and without gadolinium injection, which is not always essential. The examination must be interpreted according to a stereotyped plan that includes (1) examination of the bile ducts, searching for and describing any stenosis, the presence or absence of dilatation, (2) a systematic search for any intrahepatic calculus, (3) examination of the heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma, investigation to find any liver dysmorphia and signs of portal hypertension, (4) analysis of the enhancement of the liver parenchyma and any enhancement of the wall of the bile ducts.

A junior observer studied the variation between two levels of slice by selecting an image going through L3-L4 and the navel. The measurement of the fat obtained from an umbilical slice seemed to be well correlated and consistent with that obtained from a slice with a disc reference (L3-L4). The interobserver reproducibility is good for the quantification of the umbilical fat (Spearman and Lin at 0.9921 and 0.985 [P&lt;0.001] for the visceral fat).

Whole-body MRI using T1 and STIR sequences increases the detection of myeloma lesions. MRI-measured diffusion has demonstrated high sensitivity in terms of detection in oncology. The main objective of this study is to compare conventional radiographic staging with an MRI whole-body diffusion technique (called DWIBS) in detecting bone lesion monoclonal plasma cell pathologies (multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukaemia, plasmacytoma and MGUS). Twenty-seven patients were included (multiple myeloma: 24; plasma cell leukaemia, MGUS and plasmacytoma: 1 each). All of them had a whole-body MRI diffusion examination (using a DWIBS sequence). Diffusion MRI and conventional radiographs were compared according to the Durie-Salmon Staging System. In case of doubtful lesions, 12 months of monitoring was used as the reference method for the definitive diagnosis. The overall concordance rate between the two techniques was 63%. The DWIBS sequence detected a higher number of lesions leading to a higher Durie-Salmon stage in 37% of the patients: one stage I to II, seven stage I to III, and two stage II to III. In 18.5% of the patients, the MRI was positive while the radiographs were normal and these discrepancies were most often located in sites poorly explored by X-ray (spine, pelvis and ribs). In one patient (4%), the MRI provided a stage lower than that of the X-rays (stage II vs. III). In this case, the X-rays were positive at the humerus and femur, unlike the DWIBS sequence. Our per site analysis confirmed the clear superiority of the DWIBS sequence when compared with X-rays in the exploration of the cervical spine (56 vs. 0%, P&lt;0.001), dorsal spine (81vs. 31%,P&lt;0.0002), lumbar spine (70 vs. 35%, P&lt;0.0124), pelvis (81 vs. 33%, P&lt;0.0005) and ribs (74 vs. 36%, P&lt;0.0009).

Thyroid nodule ultrasound characterization performed by experienced clinicians allows the selection of the tumours to be punctured and guiding fine needle aspiration (FNA). FNA provide cytology information able to differentiate benign tumours from cancer in approximately 80% of cases. However, it remains difficult to identify thyroid cancers with ultrasound imaging, as demonstrated by the very low rate of cancers detected in all of the carried out FNA (approximately 5%). As a majority of thyroid cancers are hard, the stiffness evaluation has become part of nodular characterization. Since 2005, elastography has been used for the evaluation of thyroid nodules; quasi-static elastography was the first technique available and used, at first, an external pressure induced by the probe, which was then replaced by carotid internal excitation allowing improvement in sensitivity. Semi-quantitative analysis allows comparison of tissue elasticities between tissue with elasticity anomalies and normal tissue and provides therefore useful analytic information. Shear wave elastography (SWE) provides a map of the elasticity in a region and allows stiffness quantification of lesions in kilopascals in order to reinforce the predictive value of malignancy. A tumour whose stiffness is greater than 65kPa or for which the stiffness ratio is greater than 3.7 compared to surrounding healthy tissue is highly suspicious. SWE may enable the detection of malignant follicular tumours that currently escape detection by the ultrasound-guided ultrasound\/aspiration cytology couple. Lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer can also be detected by elastography due to its increased stiffness.","1253":"Breast elastography is being increasingly used to better characterize breast lesions. Published studies have shown that it improved specificity of B mode ultrasound. Two elastography modes are available: free-hand elastography and shear wave elastography. Free-hand elastography is obtained by a mechanic wave induced by the ultrasound probe, deforming the target, either by small movements induced by breathe. An elastogram is obtained and displayed either as a colour map or a size ratio or elasticity ratio measurement. The second mode is shear wave elastography; two methods are available: Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) and ARFI mode (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse). Shear wave elastography is less operator-dependent than free-hand elastography mode and provides a quantitative approach. A value of over 80kPa (SWE) or velocity results of over 2m\/s (ARFI) are considered as suspicious. False negatives may occur in soft breast cancers (mucinous carcinoma, carcinoma with an inflammatory stroma, etc.) and false positives may be seen with poorly deformable benign lesions such as old fibrous adenomas. In practical use, elastography is a useful complementary tool for undetermined breast lesions categorized as BI-RADS 4a or BI-RADS 3, or for cystic lesions but cannot avoid fine needle aspiration or core biopsy if ultrasound features are clearly suspicious.","1254":"Ultrasonography has been widely used for diagnosis since it was first introduced in clinical practice in the 1970's. Since then, new ultrasound modalities have been developed, such as Doppler imaging, which provides new information for diagnosis. Elastography was developed in the 1990's to map tissue stiffness, and reproduces\/replaces the palpation performed by clinicians. In this paper, we introduce the principles of elastography and give a technical summary for the main elastography techniques: from quasi-static methods that require a static compression of the tissue to dynamic methods that uses the propagation of mechanical waves in the body. Several dynamic methods are discussed: vibro-acoustography, Acoustic Radiation Force Impulsion (ARFI), transient elastography, shear wave imaging, etc. This paper aims to help the reader at understanding the differences between the different methods of this promising imaging modality that may become a significant tool in medical imaging.","1255":"Peripheral vascular disease is a frequently occurring disease and is most often caused by atherosclerosis and more rarely by anomalies of the collagen or other components of the arterial wall. Arterial stiffness problems form one of the precursor phenomena of peripheral vascular disease, and in the case of atherosclerosis represents an independent risk marker for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The first techniques, developed to evaluate arterial stiffness, use indirect measurements such as pulse wave velocity or the analysis of variations in pressure and volume to estimate arterial wall stiffness. Techniques based on the pulse wave lack precision because they assume that arterial stiffness is uniform throughout the path of the pulse wave, and that it is constant throughout the cardiac cycle. Moreover, measuring the velocity of the pulse wave may be less precise in certain pathological situations: metabolic syndrome, obesity, large chest, mega-dolico artery. Techniques based on the analysis of variations in pressure and in volume do not accurately measure blood pressure, which can only be taken externally. In addition, these techniques require dedicated equipment, which is not reimbursed by the French health care system, and which is cumbersome to use (especially for techniques based on variation in pressure) in clinical practice. This explains why these two techniques are not used in clinical practice. Ultrafast echography is a new ultrasound imaging method that can record up to 10,000 images per second. This high temporal resolution makes it possible to measure the velocity of the local pulse wave and arterial wall stiffness thanks to the remote palpation carried out by shear wave. The ease of use and the accuracy of these two techniques suggest that these diagnostic applications will play a significant role in vascular pathology in the future. It is possible in real time, using a traditional vascular ultrasound probe, to make an accurate assessment of local arterial stiffness and of its variation during the cardiac cycle. This technological breakthrough will probably improve phenotype evaluation of patients suffering from vascular diseases, to more effectively evaluate the cardiovascular risk for patients, at primary and secondary prevention level, and to carry out broad epidemiological studies on cardiovascular risks.","1256":"There has been considerable progress in recent years in both diagnostic and interventional breast imaging. Percutaneous procedures improve multidisciplinary management and provide patients with better information.

Tumors' destruction can sometimes replace surgery in older or frail women.","1257":"Prostate cancer is the cancer exhibiting the highest incidence rate and it appears as the second cause of cancer death in men, after lung cancer. Prostate cancer is difficult to detect, and the treatment efficacy remains limited despite the increase use of biological tests (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] dosage), the development of new imaging modalities, and the use of invasive procedures such as biopsy. Ultrasound elastography is a novel imaging technique capable of mapping tissue stiffness of the prostate. It is known that prostatic cancer tissue is often harder than healthy tissue (information used by digital rectal examination [DRE]). Two elastography techniques have been developed based on different principles: first, quasi-static (or strain) technique, and second, shear wave technique. The tissue stiffness information provided by US elastography should improve the detection of prostate cancer and provide guidance for biopsy. Prostate elastography provides high sensitivity for detecting prostate cancer and shows high negative predictive values, ensuring that few cancers will be missed. US elastography should become an additional method of imaging the prostate, complementing the conventional transrectal ultrasound and MRI. This technique requires significant training (especially for quasi-static elastography) to become familiar with acquisition process, acquisition technique, characteristics and limitations, and to achieve correct diagnoses.","1258":"","1259":"","1260":"","1261":"","1262":"","1263":"To provide quantitative information on emphysema in asymptomatic smokers in correlation with pulmonary function tests (PFT).

A very wide range of these models exist, involving many stages in the progression of tumors. Few models, however, have been proposed to reproduce in vivo tumor growth because of the complexity of the mechanisms involved. Morphological imaging combined with \"spatial\" models appears to perform well although functioning imaging could still provide further information on metabolism and the micro-architecture. The combination of imaging and modeling can resolve complex problems and describe many facets of tumor growth or response to treatment.

Ultrasound elastography is a new imaging technique under development that provides information about renal stiffness. Kidney elasticity measurements with ultrasound should be performed with a quantitative technique, such as Shearwave techniques. However kidney stiffness is not only related to fibrosis, as it also sensitive to mechanical and functional parameters such as anisotropy, vascularization, hydronephrosis and external pressure.

Intra- and inter-observer agreement in ADC measurement was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and comparison between ADC values obtained at both fields using non-parametrical tests. There were no significant differences in ADC between repeated measurements and between ADC obtained at 1.5-Tesla and those at 3.0-Tesla. The 95% limits of intra-observer agreement between ADC were 2.3%-22.7% at 1.5-Tesla and 1%-24.2% at 3.0-Tesla and those for inter-observer agreement between 1.9%-14% at 1.5-Tesla and 8%-25% at 3.0-Tesla. ADC values were similar in all pancreatic segments at 3.0-T whereas the tail had lower ADC at 1.5-Tesla. ADC measurement conveys high degrees of intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. ADC have homogeneous distribution among the four pancreatic segments at 3.0-Tesla. ","1294":"To propose polyhydramnios seen during prenatal diagnosis as a warning sign of foetal malformation. A retrospective multicentre study over a three-year period carried out in Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. We reviewed 3903 obstetric ultrasound reports. All cases of foetal malformation and polyhydramnios were counted. The instances of foetal malformation associated with polyhydramnios were compared to those of foetal malformation without polyhydramnios and to polyhydramnios only. A list of 72 cases of polyhydramnios was made (equating to 1.8%). In 55 cases (76.4%), polyhydramnios was combined with foetal malformation. These were lethal abnormalities in 33 cases and non-lethal in 22 cases. In 17 cases, polyhydramnios was not associated with any foetal malformations and in eight cases, foetal malformation was discovered in the absence of polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios had a positive predictive value of 76.4% for the presence of foetal malformation. The negative predictive value was 99.8%. Sensitivity was 87.3% and specificity was 99.5%. Polyhydramnios is a highly sensitive and specific sign for prenatal diagnosis of foetal malformation. If it is identified, then this should lead to a very careful search for foetal malformation.

In cases where the haemorrhage is the first clinical event, diagnostic work-up is critical. This retrospective study was conducted between July 2001 and March 2011. Acute phase CT-scan and MRI imaging in patients diagnosed with non-traumatic liver hematomas were interpreted with particular attention to the radio-semiotic characteristics of hematomas and liver lesions. Those findings were then confronted to the patients' final diagnoses. Twelve patients were included (mean age of 42 years). In seven of them a suspect liver lesion was discovered in the acute CT-Scan or MRI imaging. All lesions were strongly hyper vascular.The haemorrhage revealed hepatocarcinoma in four patients, liver adenoma in two and focal nodular hyperplasia in an other. It is important in spontaneous liver haemorrhage to consider the high probability of hepatocarcinoma or potentially malignant lesions even when the patient has no known hepatic disorders, and especially in young patients. The results of this study show that imaging is a key issue at the acute phase of inaugural non-traumatic hepatic haemorrhages and requires a simple but complete triphasic injected protocol.

PET is indicated in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and Hodgkin's disease. Evaluation of the response to treatment is based on Cheson's 1999 morphological criteria, which have been replaced by the 2007 IWC criteria, which combine morphological and metabolic responses. CT and FDG-PET are complementary in characterizing residual masses: if negative, a PET scan indicates the absence of residual disease, if positive; it directs a CT-guided biopsy to obtain the histological evidence. Monitoring clinical features and laboratory values is primordial following treatment. Imaging is performed as a second intention for investigating a relapse, if necessary associated with a PET scan. Multimodal imaging implies multidisciplinary consultation between haematologists, imaging specialists and histopathologists. ","1309":"Imaging myeloma is often performed when complications occur which may reveal the disease. Since the malignant plasma cell proliferation characteristic of this disease can affect the whole of the bony skeleton to various degrees, examination of the bones should be as complete as possible. The radiographic images must be studied for lytic lesions or signs of diffuse osteopenia, as well for fracture complications such as vertebral compression. Slice imaging has the advantage of being more sensitive and showing extra-osseous extension well. With a CT scan and MRI, spinal compression can be detected or a surgical procedure planned, while MRI or a PET scan can be used to assess extension of the disease and the response to treatment.","1310":"Hirayama disease is a rare, lower cervical myelopathy affecting young adults. It is responsible for pure distal motor impairment of the upper limbs, with slow progressive development in the metameric territories of C7 to T1. It is thought to be caused by movements involved in flexing the neck. Neutral position magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) looks for abnormal cervical curvature, atrophy with flattening of the cervical spine, anterior cord hyperintensity and especially a lack of posterior apposition of the dural sac. If the condition is suspected, an MRI in flexion should be performed to show anterior displacement of the cord and dural sac, enlargement of the posterior epidural space, an increase in flattening of the cord and congestion of the epidural veins. These dynamic abnormalities tend to disappear after evolving for 10 years. We report two confirmed cases and a probable case of Hirayama disease and discuss its physiopathology.","1311":"Soft tissue tumours of the musculoskeletal system are reported relatively frequently. The quality of the information gained from different imaging modalities (Doppler sonography, multislice CT, MRI spectroscopy, and diffusion MRI) means that in a growing number of situations, we can envisage determining with great accuracy not only the usual information of tumour size and topography, but often the exact nature of the tissue, almost always identifying whether a lesion is aggressive or not. Of all these techniques, Doppler sonography has become the most widely used due to the striking improvements in its sensors, especially for superficial applications. Some other recent developments are: panoramic imaging, elastography (although its current contribution is still to be determined but it seems to offer promising potential), and, most importantly, specific contrast agents. These techniques have considerably refined the quality of the information obtained, and have particularly enhanced the degree of sensitivity with which lesion progression can be assessed. Ultrasonography is the very first investigation in our protocol. It is also very often used to close investigations, as it accurately guides core needle biopsy from these generally accessible lesions. The purpose of this article is to bring together updated information on the various collections of sonographic features seen in soft tissue tumours and pseudotumours and to emphasise the considerable contributions of these new technological developments, in particular contrast-enhanced sonography. The discussion will follow the World Health Organisation's anatomical pathology classifications of soft tissue tumours. We will close with a synthesis that summarises the main steps in our diagnostic process.","1312":"The management of infections in haematology is dictated by the patient's type of acquired or induced immune deficiency (neutropenia, deficiency in cell-mediated or antibody-mediated immunity), and findings from clinical examination, laboratory studies, or morphologic investigations. The CT scan dominates in the initial management and follow-up of these patients, since clinical features very often appear to be non-specific. The radiologist's role is to guide the clinician towards a specific diagnosis such as aspergillosis or pneumocystosis, or to point them towards a non-infectious cause: tumour localisation, hypervolaemia, bronchiolitis obliterans suggestive of GVH disease, drug toxicity, or embolism.","1313":"Deep gastrointestinal involvement in endometriosis is characterised by fibrous, retractile thickening of the intestinal wall. The most common location is the upper rectum, in contiguity with a lesion of the torus uterinus. As part of a preoperative assessment, it is essential to establish an accurate and exhaustive map of intestinal lesions so that the surgeon can plan his actions. Transvaginal sonography and MRI correctly analyse pelvic and rectal involvement. Given the frequency of multiple intestinal sites, particularly sigmoid and associated ileo-caecal lesions, water enema CT should be performed. The role of rectal endoscopic sonography is debated.","1314":"Radiology of bone lacunae can help differentiate between smouldering and symptomatic myeloma. CT seems to be more apt for this purpose than a standard X-ray but appropriate principles must be applied when performing and reading it. Lesions visible in an MRI above all allow myelomas to be monitored during treatment. Because of the radiation dose, whole body CT must be performed with a slice thickness of 2mm, increments of 1.5 and intensity of 40mAs. It should be read associating the reading of the axial slices with reading the mean coronal and sagittal projections of a thickness of 2cm. Whole body MRI must associate T1-weighted sagittal, STIR coronal and b-800 diffusion-weighted axial sequences. Changes in the disease correlate with changes in the diffusion, STIR and T1-weighted images interpreted together. While whole body CT has a place in clinical routine, the indication for whole body MRI still needs to be clarified and has yet to take its place in research protocols. ","1315":"In haematological malignancies, the development of lung disease is a common source of significant morbidity and mortality for this population of patients. There is a wide range of infectious and non-infectious aetiologies that can be responsible for such complications. It is a major challenge to make an early diagnosis of aetiology in order to choose the most suitable treatment. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest has undeniably become a crucial tool in diagnosing these cases of lung disease. Although it is not possible to make a definitive diagnosis of aetiology based solely on analysing CT scan findings in these complex patients, there are some abnormalities that are highly suspicious for particular diagnoses. CT, therefore, allows the clinician to put forward and prioritise possible diagnoses that may then be considered in view of clinical information and laboratory study results. There must be multidisciplinary involvement in the management of lung disease patients and there must be an ongoing dialogue between the radiologist and the clinician.","1316":"Positron emission tomography (PET) has a proven role in the assessment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The clinical impact of PET carried out at the end of the patient's course of treatment is undeniable and recommendations must be followed in the interpretation of these examinations. PET is highly recommended as part of the initial investigations of these diseases because it can be used as a reference for the interpretation at treatment completion and allows disease spread to be assessed with greater sensitivity and specificity than when computed tomography (CT) is used. It seems to be certain that PET is useful for interim examinations too, in terms of assessing prognosis in DLBCL and HL, although its impact in terms of early changes to treatment is still to be determined. The criteria for interpreting the results of these early assessments are still evolving and the annual meetings in Menton, France, of groups of experts are leading towards a uniform interpretation method. In other types of lymphoma, PET can be useful for confirming local disease staging, especially in follicular lymphoma, and for guiding biopsy in patients with low-grade lymphoma that is suspicious for transformation into more aggressive disease. Several studies are in agreement that PET is valuable for assessing prognosis at treatment completion in FL and mantle cell lymphoma, but prospective studies are needed for this new indication to be validated.","1317":"","1318":"","1319":"Ultrasound-guided fine needle sampling is proving very useful for avoiding surgical biopsy of the sentinel lymph node for N+breast cancer. Because of its high specificity, cytology is sufficient in most cases. Focal or diffuse cortical thickening or the absence of the echogenic hilum irrespective of the size and shape of the lymph node are ultrasound signs which should be taken into account. The status of the lymph nodes in axillary and extra-axillary sites has an impact on the later management of patients and reduces the length of time for secondary lymph node dissection and adjuvant therapy, as one third of sentinel ganglion procedures can be avoided. It should be possible to optimise identification of the sentinel lymph node by the intradermal injection of ultrasound contrast agent. The cost\/effectiveness ratio is positive but unknown and should be assessed in the initial management of breast cancer.","1320":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant haematological disease characterised by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. MM is expressed by diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow, focal bone lesions and extra-medullary lesions. Conventional staging follows the Salmon and Durie classification, which was recently revised (Salmon and Durie plus) to include MRI and FDG-PET examinations. FDG-PET is being evaluated for initial staging and therapeutic monitoring and its place still needs to be validated, particularly in comparison with MRI of the pelvis and spine, the reference examination for diagnosis, which is systematically combined with X-rays of the skeleton. Certain recent data in the literature suggest that FDG-PET provides better staging of the disease at the time of diagnosis than MRI, and that the examination has considerable prognostic value when it normalises after the initial courses of chemotherapy and at the end of treatment. As for the evaluation of lymphomas, the interpretation criteria should be standardised.","1321":"Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) is becoming more and more important in the treatment of inoperable patients with early stages of pulmonary carcinomas (T1-T2 N0M0). In certain cases, evaluation of the response is still problematical and it can be difficult to differentiate response from progression. The aim of this paper is to set out these various changes and to produce a protocol for optimal monitoring. By comparing our clinical experience with data from the literature, the main visual aspects on a CT scan are set out and illustrated for each clinical situation: radiation pneumonitis, radiation fibrosis, therapeutic response and progression. The literature was reviewed by querying the main databases and selecting papers concerning pulmonary SRT and post-therapeutic radiological appearance. CT appearance induced by SRT differs significantly from images after classic conformal radiation therapy, both morphologically and chronologically. In particular, the modifications induced by stereotactic radiation therapy are only seen in a limited volume surrounding the volume treated. Knowledge of the radiological criteria necessary to differentiate between a therapeutic response and recurrence is of major importance in the present context of increase in use of this technique.","1322":"With an improvement in the temporal and spatial resolution, computed tomography (CT) is indicated in the evaluation of a great many osteoarticular diseases. New exploration techniques such as the dynamic CT and CT bone perfusion also provide new indications. However, CT is still an irradiating imaging technique and dose optimisation and reduction remains primordial. In this paper, the authors first present the typical doses delivered during CT in osteoarticular disease. They then discuss the different ways to optimise and reduce these doses by distinguishing the behavioural factors from the technical factors. Among the latter, the optimisation of the milliamps and kilovoltage is indispensable and should be adapted to the type of exploration and the morphotype of each individual. These technical factors also benefit from recent technological evolutions with the distribution of iterative reconstructions. In this way, the dose may be divided by two and provide an image of equal quality. With these dose optimisation and reduction techniques, it is now possible, while maintaining an excellent quality of the image, to obtain low-dose or even very low-dose acquisitions with a dose sometimes similar that of a standard X-ray assessment. Nevertheless, although these technical factors provide a major reduction in the dose delivered, behavioural factors, such as compliance with the indications, remain fundamental. Finally, the authors describe how to optimise and reduce the dose with specific applications in musculoskeletal imaging such as the dynamic CT, CT bone perfusion and dual energy CT.","1323":"Lymphomas affect the lymphoid system and may be expressed in a variety of ways and behave in different fashions. The polymorphism of their expression, depending on the organ involved, their variable aggressiveness and their relative rarity compared with primary or secondary diseases sometimes makes it difficult to diagnose them from imaging. Knowledge of predisposing factors and radiological signs should help suggest this diagnosis and thus lead to biopsy samples being taken to confirm it.","1324":"","1325":"To assess the short, medium and long-term results of bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) and identify the factors favouring the recurrence of haemoptysis.

The aetiologies of haemoptysis were dominated by the residual signs of pulmonary tuberculosis: 18 cases (33.96%), bronchial dilations: 12 cases (22.64%) and aspergilloma: five cases (9.43%). The bronchial arteriography showed signs of bronchial hypervascularisation in 92.45% of the cases. Forty-six patients had a first embolisation (86.79%) with immediate efficacy in 84.90% of the cases (n=45). This efficacy was noted after more than 3 years in 60.08% of the cases. Short (&lt; 30 days) and medium-term (&gt; 30 days and &lt; 3 years) recurrence of haemoptysis were noted in 17.39% and 8.69% of the cases respectively. A statistically significant correlation between aspergilloma and the immediate recurrence was found (P=0.013). The risk of medium and long-term recurrence (&gt; 3 years) was correlated with age. The survival without recurrence was statistically higher when the age was less than 60 years (P=0.0041). BAE is an effective treatment. Aspergilloma is a major risk factor in the recurrence of haemoptysis. Repeated embolisation may be proposed for these patients. ","1326":"Adenomyosis is a common benign uterine pathology that is defined by the presence of islands of ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium. It is asymptomatic in one third of cases, but when there are clinical signs they remain non-specific. It can often be misdiagnosed on sonography as it may be taken to be multiple uterine leiomyomata or endometrial thickening, both of which have a different prognosis and treatment. Adenomyosis is often associated with hormone-dependent pelvic lesions (myoma, endometriosis, or endometrial hyperplasia). It is less commonly connected to infertility or obstetrical complications and indeed any direct relationship remains controversial. The purpose of imaging is to make the diagnosis, to determine the extent of spread (focal or diffuse, superficial or deep adenomyosis, adenomyoma), and to check whether there is any associated disease, in particular endometriosis. The aim of this article is to provide assistance in recognising adenomyosis on imaging and to identify the pathologies that are commonly associated with it in order to guide the therapeutic management of symptomatic patients. Pelvic ultrasonography is the first line investigation. Sonohysterography can assist with diagnosis in some cases (pseudothickening of the endometrium seen on sonography). MRI may be used in addition to sonography to back up the diagnosis and to look for any associated disease.","1327":"","1328":"To evaluate our treatment of renal artery in-stent restenosis.

Secondary permeability of 38 arteries (63.2%) after 12.4 months (3-64) with 14 second restenoses; 33.3% after redilation with a balloon, 60% after renewed stenting, more common in smokers (P=0.02), in case of peripheral arterial disease (P=0.02), ostial location (P=0.049) and kidney function impairment at the time of diagnosis of the restenosis (P=0.012). After 12.7 months (3-64) post-revascularization, kidney function was improved in 30% of patients and stabilised in 50% of patients. Treatment of second restenoses: one failure (7.1%), nine dilations with a balloon, three cutting balloon, one second stent. Treatment of third restenoses: 71.4% treated with a balloon (2), cutting balloon (2) or coated stent (DES) (1); then permeability at a later point in time: 50%. The treatment of repeated restenoses with conventional techniques is of imperfect efficacy, and currently remains un-codified. ","1329":"","1330":"The majority of breast lesions in men are benign. Gynaecomastia is a very common condition in which hormonal changes cause male breasts to enlarge. Three radiological patterns of gynaecomastia have been described: nodular, dendritic, and diffuse glandular pattern. The main differential diagnosis is lipomastia, which is when adipose tissue deposits are found in the subcutaneous tissue. Male breast cancer is rare. The main risk factors are pathologies that cause hormonal imbalances, a history of chest irradiation, and a family history of breast cancer (particularly in families carrying a mutation of the gene BRCA2). Mammography usually shows a mass with no calcifications. Sonography is useful to investigate local disease spread, and for detecting any enlarged axillary lymph nodes. MRI is not currently indicated to investigate male breast cancer. Very often, the clinical examination alone is enough to distinguish benign lesions from malignant lesions. Imaging must not be automatically carried out, but rather it should be used when the diagnosis is clinically uncertain or when patients present risk factors for breast cancer, as well as for guiding biopsies and for assessing disease spread.","1331":"","1332":"","1333":"To evaluate the risk of low-risk prostate cancer or prostate cancer that may benefit from surveillance in patients with a PSA level less than 10 ng\/ml, a normal digital rectal examination (DRE) and a transrectal power Doppler sonography (PDS) without anomaly. Two hundred and forty-three consecutive patients with a PSA level less than 10 ng\/ml and a DRE without anomaly had PDS-guided biopsies: 12 to 15 samples were systematically taken and echo-guided in the suspect areas. The PDS results were rated from 1 to 4: 1: normal, 2: slightly hypoechogenic avascular area in which the hypo-echogenicity disappears after compression by probe, 3: hypoechogenic avascular area, 4: hypoechogenic vascularised area with power Doppler sonography. Patients rated 3 or 4 were considered to be pathological. D'Amico's criteria were used to assess the risk of a biological recurrence after treatment and those of Dall'Era were used to select the patients that could benefit from active surveillance (AS). The PDS was considered to be a true positive if at least one biopsy was positive in the same sextant as the suspect image. In a prospective manner, 106 cancers were diagnosed that could be qualified as low-risk in 84% of the cases (89% with a normal PDS and 79% with an abnormal PDS). Sixty-nine percent of the cases could be subject to AS (86% of the normal PDS cases and 47% of the abnormal PDS cases; P&lt;0.001). The PDS was normal in 159 of the 243 patients (65%). With a normal PDS, there was a 96% probability of not having a high-risk cancer. With an abnormal PDS, at least one biopsy was positive in 57% of the cases and the probability of having a significant cancer was 30% according to the Dall'Era criteria. A significant reduction was noted with a normal PDS, to 36% and 5%, respectively (VPN=95%) (P=0.015). A normal PDS in patients presenting a PSA level less than 10 ng\/ml and a DRE without anomaly may be used to put off the indication for a biopsy in order to reduce their number as well as the risks of overtreatment for a latent cancer.

Forty-six MRIs were carried out with bilateral quantification of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the neck of the femur. The intra- and inter-observer variability of the ADC measurements was evaluated. The association between the ADC and age as well as the healthy or pathological status of the neck of the femur and the Catterall classification were looked for. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of the ADC measurements was excellent. A statistically significant negative correlation between the ADC of the healthy neck of the femur and age was found. There was a significant increase in the ADC of the pathological neck of the femur compared to the healthy neck. The ratio of the pathological neck ADC and the healthy neck ADC was significantly associated with the Catterall classification. The quantification of the ADC of the neck of the femur is reproducible. This could be useful in the treatment of LCPD, where there is an early and significant increase in the ADC on the pathological side.

Since the symptoms, if there are any, are often rather non-specific, diagnosis is frequently difficult and has always to be based on a whole series of justifications. Early diagnosis is essential and this fistula should be the first possibility considered in a patient with an abdominal aortic prosthesis who is presenting rectorrhagia or melaena (even if only to a slight degree), sepsis and\/or abdominal pain. Although rare, the clinical existence of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may assist diagnosis. A CT scan is the examination of choice, the criteria providing evidence of a fistula being the presence of gaseous images in a periprosthetic fluid collection, thickening and\/or retraction of the intestinal walls in contact, the existence of a false aneurysm, and finally, very rarely, extravasation of contrast agent into the intestinal lumen.

The main feature of this very rare congenital malformation of the pectoral girdle is an abnormally high, more or less dysmorphic scapula. A congenitally high scapula is often discovered in young children, when consequences for aesthetics, and sometimes functional difficulties, are brought to light. When surgical treatment is envisaged, imaging is recommended to diagnose a supernumerary structure, ossified (an omovertebral bone) or not (a fibrous and\/or cartilaginous connection), extending from the scapula to the cervical spine. This needs to be resected. A CT scan is essential for detecting an omovertebral bone and the vertebral bone abnormalities that are often associated with it.

Good patient positioning is essential and is obtained by using foam wedges for small breasts, ensuring there are no folds, and the correct position of the nipples. These aspects limit movement artefacts which alter subtraction sequences, so that it must always be possible for reading these sequences to be assisted by comparing them with the native sequences. New functional imaging sequences are now appearing in an attempt to increase the specificity of MRI, which is one of its main limitations. Of these, magnetic resonance spectroscopy appears to be the most promising, highlighting an abnormal choline peak in malignant lesions.

In fact, only a minute quantity of contrast product passes into the mother's milk, much less than the threshold recommended in paediatrics in the infant. However, a suspension of lactation for 24h after the injection of gadolinium chelate is still recommended in France.

In vascular diseases, a dural arteriovenous fistula with perimedullary venous drainage is the most common vascular malformation and a source of diagnostic error. On discovering a medullary cavity, the radiologist needs to know when to discount focal distensions of the ependymal canal and how to detect tumoral syringomyelia. In the case of a tumour, he should know the characteristics of common tumours such as astrocytomas, ependymomas, haemangioblastomas and cavernomas. In inflammatory diseases, he should know when a brain examination is required.

For the 178 lumpectomies studied, the sensitivity of the radiographs of the surgical specimen was 33.3% for ISDC and 50% for IDC. The surgical revision rate was 27.41% for ISDC and 12.64% for IDC. The significant predictive factors for positive margins were the radiological size of the lesions (&gt;10mm) for ISDC (P=0.02) and radiologically positive margins for IDC (P=0.01).

The sonographic appearance of all the nodules suggested BI-RADS category 3 fibroadenomas. The mean size of the fibroadenomas was 9mm. The mean duration of follow-up was 29.7months. Seven nodules had atypical cytology: a microbiopsy and\/or excision found a simple fibroadenoma (n=3), mastitis (n=1), a fibroadenoma associated with a papilloma (n=1), fibrosis (n=1) and normal tissue (n=1). Seven other nodules were resected during treatment for synchronous cancer, and were diagnosed as fibroadenomas. Two hundred and seventy-six nodules were followed-up (121 patients were lost to follow-up [n=132]) and the appearance of 263 nodules (95.29%) was stable. Seven nodules, which had increased in size, underwent another FNAB or microbiopsy or surgery. Five nodules were not found again. The borders of one nodule showed modifications. The use of fine needle aspiration biopsy, interpreted by an experienced cytologist, means that short term follow-up of fibroadenomas can be avoided. ","1371":"The stated aims of treating acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are to prevent a pulmonary embolism, stop the clot from spreading, reduce the risk of a recurrence; they are less concerned with the late morbidity associated with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). In accordance with the French (Afssaps, 2009) and North American (ACCP, 2008) recommendations, anticoagulants (LMWH, heparin, AVK) form the cornerstone for treating DVT. These treatments appear to be far less effective in preventing post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), associated with venous hypertension, residual occlusion, and with reflux caused by valve incompetence. Given that, the new aim is to optimise the prevention of PTS, the ACCP guidelines, unlike those of Afssaps, \"suggest\" for selected patients suffering from acute iliofemoral DVT, the use of both classic anticoagulants, and in situ percutaneous administration of thrombolytic drugs (recommendation grade 2B) and simultaneous correction of any underlying anatomical anomalies using angioplasty and stenting (recommendation 2C). Contemporary endovascular methods, referred to collectively as \"facilitated\" thrombolysis, combine low doses of rtPa or Urokinase administered locally, and the removal of the clot using various mechanical, rotating, rheolytic systems, or using ultrasound. The results of non-randomised, heterogeneous studies objectivised a lysis rate of 80%, a 50% lower risk of haemorrhage complications compared with systemic thrombolysis (&lt;4%), and a clear reduction in treatment time (one-shot methods possible for procedures lasting less than 2 hours). This data ties in with the modern \"open vein\" concept which underpins the hope of an improvement in the late prognosis of acute DVT, through the removal of a clot, thereby improving permeability and valve integrity; this hypothesis is supported by the results at 24 months of a randomised CaVent objectifying absolute risk reduction of 15% in the thrombolysis in situ. The current randomised study (ATTRACT trial) comparing the combination of \"facilitated thrombolysis\" in addition to the usual treatment with the traditional treatment alone for acute iliofemoral DVT, the statistical power of which has been established (600 patients) to authenticate a reduction by a third in the number of PTS (CaVent trial, showing a 15% reduction rate of 24 months PTS in the thrombolysed group results expected in 2016), might, if the results are positive, lead to a profound change in the paradigms for the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT.","1372":"","1373":"A series of serious accidents following spinal, cervical and lumbar foraminal injections has led French medical insurers to start discussions with professional radiologists to ask us to take the necessary measures allowing them to continue to cover the exceptional but considerable risks of these interventional radiology procedures.

The range of indications for transforaminal injections has shrunk in favour of epidural injections. Where the transforaminal approach is still used, the needle must be positioned extremely accurately. A prior radioopaque contrast medium injection is essential from a safety perspective.

Over the last few years, sonography has begun to offer an interesting alternative. Its advantages are that it is a relatively inexpensive technique, while not emitting ionising radiation and being easily accessible. There has been a great deal of technical progress including high frequency transducers, which have led to performance improvements in terms of both diagnosis and treatment of pathologies of the motor system. Due to these technical advances and to sterile covers for the transducers, it is now possible to visualise and to aspirate or inject into a peripheral joint, a tendon sheath or a bursa with or without effusion. This technique does not require a contrast medium injection because the needle position can be checked directly. Minimally invasive, it allows a number of interventions to be carried out with a very low complication rate since the entire path of the needle is followed using sonography, which means that nerves, vessels and other structures can be avoided because they are visualised directly in real time.","1385":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare but severe condition of the central nervous system.

These masses result from the proliferation of fibroblast and lymphocyte cells associated with collagen wickerwork. Most often benign, they may affect any organ or supporting tissue. However, these lesions remain non-specific and are difficult to distinguish from malignant tumoral processes. Here resides the value of imaging: to make the diagnosis, guide the biopsy and thereby avoid early damaging surgery or an aggressive medical treatment. This is all the more valid since recent papers have shown that corticotherapy of short duration is currently the first intention treatment We here describe the case of a female patient presenting disseminated erythematous lupus who presented a cervical myofibroblastic tumour.

It is based on MRI, which allows for aetiological diagnosis and an extension evaluation. In addition, in a certain number of cases, the type of infection is not known and it is up to the MRI via use of an exhaustive technique to diagnose an infectious origin when faced with a mass syndrome.

MRI is the examination of choice, as it detects oedema within the trabecular bone very early, before the onset of destruction. Injection of a contrast medium with fat signal saturation improves detection and visualisation of the spread of infection in the soft tissue and epidural space.

We report twenty cases of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) with a discussion of epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic features, treatment and progress of this pathological entity. A retrospective study of twenty cases compiled from a ten-year period, from 952 pathological anatomy examinations carried out to investigate various breast pathologies. The patients had a mean age of 45.5 years. Clinical examinations revealed a tumefaction measuring between 2.5 and 18 cm in diameter. The mean size was 5.5 cm. Mammography showed nodular lesions and sonography demonstrated hypoechoic nodules. On histological examination there was a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate of epithelioid and giant cells, without caseation necrosis, made up of lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. Microbiology investigations were negative. Lesion involvement was principally lobulocentric. Surgical excision of the lesions was combined with corticosteroid therapy in twelve cases, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in another four and with antibiotic therapy in four cases. The patients made good progress in the short-term. IGM is a rare entity. It poses a problem of differential diagnosis because it clinically resembles other forms of mastitis.

MRI and, in some cases, sonography investigations lead to early diagnosis and appropriate management. Computed tomography has limited value. Needle aspiration and biopsy need not be routine. In children, anatomical particularities explain the different morphological manifestations, which vary with age. It is important to both know when to propose the diagnosis of infection, so that appropriate imaging investigations are carried out, and to be aware of the symptomatology of limb infections in children and adults and understand the differential diagnoses for each age group.

This article illustrates the imaging semiology of the various right colonic, iliac, mesenteric and appendicular conditions that could potentially cause an infection of the right iliac fossa. It specifies the indications of ultrasound and CT scans, respectively, which depend on the age of the patient and the clinical signs and symptoms. Though the CT scan is commonly used in abdominal emergencies in general, and particularly in clinical pictures of infection of the right iliac fossa, ultrasound remains recommended as first line imaging when confronted with suspected appendicitis or lymphadenitis in a young subject or in the monitoring of Crohn's disease.","1408":"Imaging plays a key role in lung infections. A CT scan must be carried out when there is a strong clinical suspicion of pneumonia that is accompanied by normal, ambiguous, or nonspecific radiography, a scenario that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients. CT allows clinicians to detect associated abnormalities or an underlying condition and it can guide bronchoalveolar lavage or a percutaneous or transbronchial lung biopsy. An organism can vary in how it is expressed depending on the extent to which the patient is immunocompromised. This is seen in tuberculosis in patients with AIDS. The infective agents vary with the type of immune deficiency and some infections can quickly become life-threatening. Clinicians should be aware of the complex radiological spectrum of pulmonary aspergillosis, given that this diagnosis must be considered in specific settings.","1409":"The diagnosis of pelvic infection is most often made clinically, based on a combination of pelvic pain and fever, and possibly a foul discharge. The patient is referred to radiology in two very different circumstances: either in the acute phase where the challenge is to differentiate a pelvic infection from appendicitis, urinary tract infection, and complications of a hemorrhagic luteal cyst; or some time after the infectious episode, which may have gone unnoticed, and the patient presents with an undetermined pelvic mass that needs to be characterized, where the challenge in that situation is not to confuse it with ovarian cancer.

The diagnostic approach should take into account the type of immunodepression, the clinical picture, the radiological signs and symptoms, and the microbiological, cytological and even histological examination of the pulmonary or extrapulmonary specimens. The high-resolution CT scan plays a central role and makes it possible to prioritize the diagnostic possibilities. The analysis of the literature shows three important points: the chest X-ray has low diagnostic value; the CT scan of the chest can reveal lesions that cannot be detected on a standard chest X-ray; the CT scan is helpful for early detection and monitoring of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

In order to guide clinicians and interventional practitioner for the use of this new approach, different French scientific societies (Hypertension, Cardiology and Radiology) decided to combine their expertise and propose an expert consensus to assess benefit\/risk ratio of this technique in the field of arterial hypertension. In 2012, this expert consensus propose to limit renal denervation technique to patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled by four or more antihypertensive therapies with at least one treatment being a diuretic and spironolactone at a dose of 25mg shown to be unable to control blood pressure. Measurement of office BP should be at least with SBP more than 160mmHg and\/or DBP more than 100mmHg confirmed by ambulatory BP measurement (home or ABP measurement with SBP more than 135mmHg and DBP more than 85mm during daytime period). Finally, renal artery anatomy and function should allow proper intervention (i.e., two functional kidneys, absence of previous renal angioplasty). Renal enervation is a complex interventional procedure with potentially arterial complications, training is required for practitioners. Antihypertensive treatment should not be interrupted immediately after renal denervation since blood pressure lowering effect are delayed and reached maximum effect after 3 months. Monitoring of blood pressure, renal function and anatomy of renal arteries is required 12 months and 36 months after procedure.

A total of 152 PTs were recorded on the first chest CT examinations with a range of two to 19 pleural opacities per patient. All PTs had a posterior distribution in the lower lobes. On the additional acquisitions, 144 PTs disappeared. Seventeen patients presented complete regression of PTs and two patients presented persistence of eight PTs. Additional low dose acquisition in prone position should be performed in all patients presenting with focal PT in a dependent and basal location.

We performed a retrospective study of 102 CT scans in adults, distributed into two groups based on the cirrhotic or malignant etiology of their ascites. The CT signs studied were ascites volume and relative distribution between the greater peritoneal cavity (GPC) and the omental bursa (OB), the density of the ascites, the thickness of the gallbladder wall, the thickness of the parietal peritoneum and its degree of enhancement, and tethered-bowel sign. The CT signs associated with malignant ascites were: presence of fluid in the omental bursa (P=0.003), thickening of the peritoneum its degree of enhancement (P=0.005), increased density of the ascites (P=0.01), and loss of mobility of bowel loops in the ascites (P=0.001). There was no difference in gallbladder wall thickness between the two groups. The CT scan can play a role in diagnosing malignant ascites. We confirm the usefulness of the indirect signs composed of distribution of ascites fluid, thickening and enhancement of the parietal peritoneum, and loss of mobility of the bowel loops in the ascites. ","1419":"To evaluate the use of the Vittel criteria in addition to a clinical examination to determine the need for a whole body scan (WBS) in a severe trauma patient. Between December 2008 and November 2009, 339 severe trauma patients with at least one Vittel criterion were prospectively evaluated with a WBS. The following data were collected: the Vittel criteria present, circumstances of the accident, traumatic injury on the WBS, and irradiation. The original intent to prescribe a computed tomography (CT) scan (whole body or a targeted region), based solely on clinical signs, was specified. Injuries were diagnosed in 55.75% of the WBS (n=189). The most common Vittel criteria were \"global assessment\" (n=266), \"thrown, run over\" (n=116), and \"ejected from vehicle\" (n=94). The multivariate analysis used the following as independent criteria for predicting severe traumatic injury on the WBS: Glasgow score less than 13, penetrating trauma, and colloid resuscitation greater than 11. Based solely on clinical factors, 164 patients would not have had any scan or (only) a targeted scan. In that case, 15% of the severe injuries would have been missed. Using the Vittel criteria to determine the need for a WBS in a severe trauma patient makes it possible to find serious injuries not suspected on the clinical examination, but at the cost of an increased number of normal scans. ","1420":"","1421":"Most infections of the upper urinary tract are straightforward and do not require any emergency radiological investigations. A sonogram carried out within 48 hours will in most cases be sufficient to eliminate obstructed pyelonephritis requiring emergency drainage of urine. In complicated cases, or those affecting already weakened areas, an urgent CT scan is necessary, preferably after injection of iodinated contrast medium if renal function permits. CT scanning is far better at diagnosis than sonography as well as at investigating whether there are complications. Furthermore, it is essential that the radiologist is aware of unusual and rare forms of pyelonephritis, especially pseudotumoural forms, so that clinicians can be pointed towards the appropriate treatment, avoiding unnecessary and invasive interventions.","1422":"The diagnosis of infections associated with orthopedic implants is based on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory findings and imaging studies. There is no gold standard imaging technique: conventional radiography is indispensable, although 50% of the time the radiograph is normal. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography are valuable to detect soft tissue abnormalities. Bone scintigraphy (BS) rules out active infection. For infections involving the peripheral skeleton, labeled white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy coupled with colloid scintigraphy is the reference technique, whereas a gallium scan is always necessary for imaging the spine or pelvis. To confirm or rule out infection, needle aspiration with analysis of aspirated fluid is the cornerstone of the diagnostic algorithm.","1423":"The main organs in the left iliac fossa are the descending colon, sigmoid colon and, in women, internal reproductive organs. An infection of the left iliac fossa must lead the clinician firstly to suspect diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon in older patients and salpingitis in women of childbearing age. Other less common aetiologies are possible (inflammatory or infectious colitis, epiploic appendagitis, abscess of the psoas, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, etc.). Sonography as a first-line investigation may lead to diagnosis (especially in gynaecological disease), but a CT scan with intravenous injection of an iodine-containing contrast medium will allow for a full assessment of disease spread, and complications of sigmoid colitis or its differential diagnoses (abscess, fistula, perforation) to be investigated. It can also be used to guide percutaneous drainage or fine-needle aspiration for microbiology investigations.","1424":"","1425":"In epididymo-orchitis, a sonogram shows a non-homogenous and hypertrophied epididymis and testis, with increased vascularisation seen on a Doppler sonogram. Abscesses must be investigated using sonography so that a necrotic tumour is not misdiagnosed. In prostatitis, sonography is indicated to investigate urine retention and where treatment has failed (to look for a blockage, an abscess, or pyelonephritis). Endorectal sonography is the best imaging modality for analysing the parenchyma, but otherwise has limited value. Chronic prostatitis is the main differential diagnosis from prostate cancer; the two may be distinguished using diffusion MRI. In cases of cystitis, imaging is indicated when a patient has recurrent cystitis (to investigate what the causative factors might be), or an infection with a less common bacterium (to look for calcifications, emphysema, any involvement of the upper urinary tract), and in cases of cystitis with pseudotumour.","1426":"","1427":"","1428":"The recent application of endovascular treatment techniques to venous pathologies has meant that new therapeutic solutions can be offered to patients suffering from post-thrombotic syndrome. This often-underestimated condition frequently complicates cases of deep vein thrombosis, whether treated or not, leading to a chronic and disabling set of clinical symptoms (oedema, claudication, pain, venous ulcers, etc.) due to the combination of the pathophysiological phenomena of obstructions and reflux. These clinical signs see only minimal improvement when managed with the classic medical treatment, venotonic agents, and venous compression. We report the cases of two patients suffering with chronic post-thrombotic venous obstruction of the lower limbs in whom endovascular treatment brought clear and long-lasting clinical improvement.","1429":null,"1430":"","1431":"","1432":"The reference method for characterising a solid renal mass is computed tomography. MRI and ultrasound can provide useful diagnostic information for characterising masses the cystic or solid nature of which it is not possible to determine from data from the CT scan. For characterising a solid mass, only MRI can replace the CT scan in most cases. Once a mass has been shown to be solid and vascularised and not occurring in a context suggesting an inflammatory pseudotumour, it can be put, using CT, into one of the four categories of the classification that we propose: pseudotumoral dysmorphisms (type 1); typical high-fat angiomyolipomas (type 2); suspect indeterminate tumours (type 3); typically malignant tumours (type 4).","1433":"Malignant primary epithelial tumours of the penis are rare and mainly affect uncircumcised men in their fifties to seventies. They are most frequently located in the glans and foreskin. Imaging is performed if the clinician has doubts about deep extension, after a diagnostic biopsy. High-resolution ultrasound and above all MRI are used to detect invasion of the corpora cavernosa and spongiosum. The lesion is often seen as a moderate T2 hyposignal, making it possible to distinguish it from the relative hypersignal of the corpora cavernosa. The sentinel lymph nodes are inguinal. Adenopathy is frequently present, but does not, however, necessarily reflect tumour invasion, as secondary infection of the lesion, which is often ulcerated, is common. The prognosis for T1 N0 tumours is good, at the cost of mutilating ablation. Extension to the lymph nodes is detrimental. Non-epithelial tumours and metastases are even rarer.","1434":"This paper aims to argue the advantages of using routine multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) prior to the first series of biopsies in patients with suspected cancer of the prostate indicated by a rise in Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA). Using biopsy targeted onto a lesion seen by MRI, this diagnostic strategy could increase detection of significant cancers and improve evaluation of their grade and size. This strategy would also mean that the detection of insignificant cancers (microfoci detected by chance during systematic biopsy) would decrease, since if the mp-MRI did not give rise to suspicion, the indications for biopsy would be reduced. It could also reduce the number of biopsies to be performed even when the mp-MRI is suspicious, by resorting solely to targeted biopsies. This review does not evaluate the role of mp-MRI in locoregional staging.","1435":"Multiparametric MRI of the prostate is an essential examination for the diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and planning of treatment for prostate cancer. This examination can accurately detect cancer foci in the gland so that the most appropriate management can be offered, reduce the risk of over-treatment and also ensure that certain aggressive lesions or unusual locations, which might affect the prognosis, are not ignored. We present here its main indications, focusing on the techniques for interpreting MRI, its performance and its limitations, as well as the recent European recommendations underlining the need for international harmonisation.","1436":"Renal cancers account for approximately 3% of adult cancers and the mean age of diagnosis is 65, with men affected two to three times more frequently than women. However, an increase is being seen in kidney tumours also in young adults and in women. The classification of renal tumours includes both benign and malignant tumours, and is currently quite exhaustive, but may be even more extensive in the coming years, particularly for tumours in renal impairment. Except for certain specific entities (such as chromophobe carcinoma), two criteria are required to correctly classify malignant kidney tumours: the Fuhrman grade, and the pTNM stage, defining tumour extension. The stage and grade are applicable in the same way, regardless of the nature of the tumours; for a given group, they are the best prognostic factors.","1437":"In this article examining pitfalls in osteoarticular imaging we examine the differential diagnosis of osteomyelitis from bone tumours. We describe the different features which differentiate these two types of disease in radiology and CT and MRI scanning.","1438":"Cancer of the bladder is the seventh most common of all cancers observed in France, and is the second urological cancer after prostate cancer. It is mainly related to nicotine addiction. When doing the initial tests, ultrasound examination of the bladder can enable the clinician to diagnose a polypoid tumour and thus avoid his having to organise diagnostic fibroscopy. When the bladder tumour infiltrates the detrusor muscle, the situation becomes life-threatening for the patient and radical treatment is envisaged. Uro-CT is the standard examination to characterise the lesion and describe its relationship with neighbouring organs. It is essential, and must be performed before endoscopic resection of the tumour, to be correctly interpreted. It is imperative for imaging to look for a synchronous lesion in the upper urinary tract (ureters, renal pelvis), because the presence of such a lesion changes the prognosis of the disease and the sequence of therapy, which is decided by the urologist in a multidisciplinary consultation.","1439":"Bladder cancer occurs frequently and is serious. Although ultrasound and CT examination are essential, magnetic resonance imaging is more effective for staging large tumours and in atypical cases, in particular submucosal lesions. CT and MRI are equally effective in examining the lymph nodes. The examination technique is simple. The prospects for using MRI, in particular with diffusion imaging, are being evaluated.","1440":"Since there are salvage solutions, it is important to detect local recurrence of prostate cancer as early as possible. The first sign is \"biochemical failure\" in that the prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration rises again. The definition of biochemical failure varies depending on the initial treatment: PSA greater than 0.2ng\/mL after prostatectomy, nadir+2ng\/mL after radiotherapy. There is no standardised definition of biochemical failure after cryotherapy, focused ultrasound, or brachytherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (particularly dynamic MRI) can detect local recurrence with good sensitivity. The role of spectroscopy is still under discussion. For the moment, ultrasound techniques are less effective than MRI.","1441":"Thermal ablation techniques for renal tumours have become the norm in surgically at-risk patients. These percutaneous treatments are locally effective, particularly for tumours measuring less than 4cm. Larger tumours may be treated by adapting the technique and strategy. Multidisciplinary discussion is essential before any decision, in order to decide on the most appropriate technique. Radiofrequency is simple, effective and inexpensive. Cryotherapy is more complex and should be preferred when the tumour is large or there is vascular or urinary tract contact. Microwaves can be used to treat larger tumours. Morbidity is low, but good knowledge of these techniques and of dissection is required to avoid injury to neighbouring digestive or urinary structures.","1442":"The prognosis for testicular cancer is excellent, with a 5-year survival rate greater than 95%. Patients affected can therefore expect to be cured after treatment. Successful treatment requires assessment of the condition at the various stages of its management. Imaging plays a major role in initial analysis of the lymphatic extension and in looking for metastases. It is essential for evaluating the response to treatment and during follow-up after treatment. CT is the most commonly used imaging method in this context, but the role of PET is currently developing. The purpose of this paper is to review the role of the imaging methods commonly used in the management of testicular cancer.","1443":"To evaluate the diagnostic value of indirect ultrasound signs during acute appendicitis. Our retrospective study lasted 5 years, from May 2005 to April 2010. It concerned 620 cases of appendectomy performed following prior ultrasound examination of the right iliac fossa (RIF). In 448 cases, ultrasonography clearly showed the appendix, which was inflamed. The presence of indirect signs of appendix inflammation without visualisation of the appendix was confirmed by ultrasound examination in 160 cases. In 12 cases, the appendix was not visualised nor were there any indirect signs on the ultrasound image. The indirect signs involved were hypertrophy of the peritoneal fat (HPF), pain caused by compression on exploration of the right iliac fossa, and localised hypokinesia in the digestive loops (LHL). We compared the results found by ultrasonography with the operative and anatomical pathology reports. The positive predictive value of the indirect signs of appendicitis on the ultrasound scan was 95.8% if the three indirect signs were associated, 87.5% for the association of pain and HPF, 45.8% for the association of pain and LHL, and 25% if there was just pain. The negative predictive value of the indirect signs of appendicitis on the ultrasound scan was 57.2% if the three signs were associated, 65.9% for the association of pain and HPF and 60.7% for the association of pain and LHL, with 83.3% for pain alone. The sensitivity of the indirect signs was 83.9% if the three signs were associated, 31.8% for the association of pain and HPF, 50% for the association of pain and LHL, and 50% if there was just pain. The specificity of the indirect signs was 85.7% if the three signs were associated, 96.7% for the association of pain and HPF, 56.7% for the association of pain and LHL, and 62.5% if there was just pain. When tomodensitometry cannot be performed and the appendix is not visible on ultrasound examination, indirect ultrasound signs must be systematically sought, particularly in populations in which appendicitis are highly prevalent.

The source of infection is most often biliary, and more rarely gastrointestinal via the portal tract, or even hematogenic. Other than in special contexts (scarring after radiofrequency ablation), focal liver lesions are not a usual risk factor for hepatic abscesses in patients with a history of bile duct procedures (sphincterotomy, biliary stenting, biliary enteric anastomosis). MATERIALS AND METHOD - RESULTS: We report four cases of focal liver lesions (two patients with benign lesions of the biliary cyst type and two other patients with lesions due to pancreatic cancer) complicated by a superinfection in patients with a history of bile duct procedures. There were no predisposing factors other than a context of cancer or diabetes. Superinfection of a focal liver lesion should be considered when there is a suggestive clinical picture and a change in the appearance of the lesion in patients with a history of bile duct procedures in a context of cancer or diabetes. ","1450":"Triple-negative breast cancers generally occur in young women and they have the potential to be aggressive. It is important for this subtype of tumour to be detected early. We studied the appearance of 73 tumours on mammography, sonography and MRI in order to determine what specific features they showed on imaging. From July 2009 to December 2010, we retrospectively reviewed mammogram and sonogram images of 73 triple-negative cancers. Colour Doppler had been used to depict vascularisation in 34 cases and elastography score calculated in 17 cases. Sixteen patients had undergone MRI. The radiological description of these different modalities draws on the BI-RADS lexicon and categorisation. On mammography, triple-negative cancers often presented as a round mass (59.3%) or an oval or lobulated mass (65%), with circumscribed (15%), microlobulated (12.5%), indistinct (55%) or occasionally spiculated margins (15%). On sonography, the vast majority of these cancers appeared as masses (92.8%) with occasional posterior acoustic attenuation (22.6%). MRI showed more suspicious images than the standard examinations, notably rim-enhancement (eight out of 12 masses). . Radiological images appear as lobulated masses more readily, while on sonography posterior enhancement is shown more often than attenuation, and MRI finds rim-enhancement.

Improvement in scanning techniques has made it possible to modify the diagnostic strategy and improve the therapeutic management of the patients. The aim of this iconographic review is to recall the causes of digestive haemorrhage following supramesocolic surgery and to illustrate the dominant role of tomodensitometry in diagnosing it and in planning and controlling the efficacy of endovascular treatment.","1454":"Autism is a pervasive disorder of childhood development. Polymorphous clinical profiles combining various degrees of communication and social interaction with restricted and stereotyped behaviour are grouped under the heading of 'autism spectrum disorders' (ASD). Many teams are trying to pick out the underlying cerebral abnormalities in order to understand the neuronal networks involved in relationships with others. Here we review the morphological, spectroscopic and functional abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal circuit, the caudate nuclei, the cerebellum, and the frontotemporal regions, which have been described in subjects with ASD. White matter abnormalities have also been described in diffusion tensor imaging, leading to suspected damage to the subjacent neural networks, such as mirror neurones or the social brain.","1455":"","1456":"Inflammatory syndrome is one of the rare emergency breast situations. Its etiology is benign, infectious in most cases. The clinical examination is often self-evident and suggests the diagnosis. But alone it is insufficient, and diagnostic tests are necessary to guide therapy. As essential as it is, mammography's limitations reinforce the benefit of ultrasonography, which in all cases reveals an abscess and has greater sensitivity for detecting a malignant tumor. If the etiology is benign, clinical signs will disappear with medical treatment, with no need for further investigation. While it is legitimate to initiate a trial treatment, it must not delay oncologic management, because of the severity of inflammatory cancer.","1457":"Breast inflammation is a difficult clinical problem as it can result from a variety of causes: specific or non-specific infectious mastitis, which may or may not be complicated, primary or secondary inflammatory mastitis or inflammatory cancer. The main objective of radiology is to eliminate an inflammatory cancer. Other objectives are to characterise an inflammatory condition (where the clinical context is valuable in guiding diagnosis but which often requires a micro- or macrobiopsy) or to obtain a microorganism in cases of complicated infectious mastitis (a diagnostic procedure but also comprising the first stage of treatment). Whether for bacteriological or histological purposes, percutaneous samples therefore play a large part in the diagnostic procedure, other than in the clinical context of pregnancy where mastitis is more easily diagnosed because of its frequency. The guidance method is usually ultrasound, and the needle chosen will depend on the radiological or ultrasound signal: puncture with an 18G needle will be used for a bacteriological sample, microbiopsy of a mass or lymph nodes, or macrobiopsy in the case of microcalcifications.","1458":"Breast MRI should not be used for differential diagnosis between inflammatory breast cancer and acute mastitis (AM) prior to treatment. When mastitis symptoms persist after 10 to 15 days of well-managed medical treatment, MRI may be performed in addition to an ultrasound examination, a mammogram and to taking histological samples, in order to eliminate inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). For staging, MRI would seem to be useful in looking for a contralateral lesion, PET-CT for finding information about remote metastases and in certain centres, for information about the initial extension to local\/regional lymph nodes, which would guide the fields of irradiation (since patients can become lymph node negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy). MRI and PET-CT seems to be useful for early detection of patients responding poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy so that the latter may be rapidly modified.","1459":"Carcinomatous mastitis is a severe form of breast cancer and its diagnosis is essentially clinical and histological. The first examination to perform is still mammography, not only to provide evidence supporting this diagnosis but also to search for a primary intramammary lesion and assess local\/regional spread. It is essential to study the contralateral breast for bilaterality. Ultrasound also provides evidence supporting inflammation, but appears to be better for detecting masses and analysing lymph node areas. The role of MRI is debatable, both from a diagnostic point of view and for monitoring during treatment, and should be reserved for selected cases. An optimal, initial radiological assessment will enable the patient to be monitored during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","1460":"Benign mastitis is a rare disease and its management is difficult. The diagnostic challenge is to distinguish it from carcinomatous mastitis. We make a distinction between acute mastitis secondary to an infection, to inflammation around a benign structure or to superficial thrombophlebitis, and chronic, principally plasma cell and idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. Imaging is often non-specific but we need to know and look for certain ultrasound, mammogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs to give a pointer as early as possible towards a benign aetiology. A biopsy should be undertaken systematically where there is the slightest diagnostic doubt, to avoid failing to recognise a carcinomatous mastitis.","1461":"Red, hot, and painful breast inflammation can have a large number of causes. The history of the condition and clinical observations usually give a pointer to the aetiological diagnosis, which is based on the classic triad of clinical, radiological and histopathological examinations, and guide the choice of additional investigations for rapid therapeutic management of this breast emergency. In breastfeeding women, the cause is often mastitis or, more rarely, an abscess; in non-breastfeeding women, the problem may be mastitis or a periareolar abscess, inflammatory lesions sometimes with secondary infection, or more rarely a real abscess, regardless of a catalogue of various causes. In all cases, the possibility must be considered of inflammatory breast cancer.","1462":"","1463":"","1464":"","1465":"","1466":"","1467":"","1468":"We report a series of three cases of progressive anterior vertebral fusion diagnosed and monitored in our establishment.

The radiographic semeiotics are characteristic and combine anterior pinching of the disc, well-delimited erosion of the anterior vertebral corners and anterior then posterior intervertebral ankylosis. MRI is very useful for assessing the extent of the intervertebral ankylosis and the condition of the residual discs, without irradiation. The condition develops over several months or years. Conservative treatment is usually sufficient.","1469":null,"1470":null,"1471":"The objective of this retrospective study was to analyze the efficacy and morbidity associated with splenic artery embolization for hypersplenism due to portal hypertension (PHT), as a function of the volume of the splenic parenchyma embolized and the type of PHT (due to intrahepatic block or segmental PHT). This study retrospectively included 17 patients with hypersplenism secondary to PHT (intrahepatic block, n=14; segmental, n=3) treated by splenic artery embolization. The splenic volume embolized was estimated by computed tomography (CT) one month after embolization. A clinical assessment and platelet count took place at 7 days, 1 month and 6 months after the embolization. In the group with PHT due to intrahepatic block, the mean volume of embolized splenic parenchyma was 63% of the initial volume (range: 30-95%). Six months later, the platelet level had increased by an average of 232%. All patients with fewer than 80,000 platelets\/mL at 6 months had an embolization volume less than 50%. In the segmental PHT group, the mean volume of the embolized parenchyma was 62% of the initial volume (range: 20-95%), bleeding symptoms had disappeared in all patients, and the platelet level exceeded 80,000\/mL. Six patients (6\/17, 35%) had complications, two minor and four major: two splenic abscesses, one respiratory distress with ascites, and one pancreatitis with ascites. Five of the six complications were observed in patients with a volume of embolized splenic parenchyma more than 70%. Our results show that splenic embolization of more than 50% of the parenchyma is effective in the treatment of hypersplenism due to PHT, but that when the embolized volume exceeds 70%, the procedure is associated with considerable morbidity.

The success of the procedure is dictated by the indication. The radiologist must look for radiographic arguments indicating or contraindicating fitting an implant, and particularly for the presence of facet arthritis which will prompt the surgeon to choose an arthrodesis. Moreover, radiological information plays a major part in preparing for a surgical procedure, as far as access to the disc via the anterior approach is concerned and assessment by CT angiography of the risk of vascular complications. After insertion, radiological monitoring using dynamic X-ray images checks that the implant is correctly positioned and that mobility is restored. In the long term, it can detect complications related to the prosthesis and premature wear to other points of support such as adjacent discs and the facet joints.","1474":"Although optical colonoscopy is still the gold standard for diseases of the colon, radiologic examination of the colon is now being performed by CT scan. Evaluation of the colon is enhanced by distension, which \"de-folds\" the intestinal wall, thus facilitating its examination for abnormalities of the mucosa, the wall as a whole, and the diameter of the bowel lumen. Water or gas (CO(2)) may be used for the distension, depending on the suspected lesions. The water enema method of colonography combines filling the bowel lumen with water and intravenous injection of a contrast medium. It is indicated when there is a clinical suspicion of colon cancer, or for initial discovery of liver metastases, and for staging of colon tumors. This technique, which requires little or no colon cleansing preparation, can be performed with no special equipment and has a short learning curve. The gas enema method of colonography, or virtual colonoscopy, is performed by distending the colon with CO(2), without any intravenous injection of contrast medium. Its purpose is to detect polyps as part of a screening for precancerous growths. This technique, which does require bowel cleansing preparation, uses a dedicated console for reading and requires specific training.","1475":""},"articletitle":{"0":"CT-guided microwave ablation of osteoid osteoma: Long-term outcome in 28 patients.","1":"4D flow MRI derived aortic hemodynamics multi-year follow-up in repaired coarctation with bicuspid aortic valve.","2":"Liver spontaneous hypoattenuation on CT is an imaging biomarker of the severity of acute pancreatitis.","3":"Peer reviewing: A not so lengthy process.","4":"Risk of pleural and diaphragmatic complications following percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of basal lung nodules: Complications following radiofrequency ablation of basal lung nodules.","5":"Percutaneous reinforced cementoplasty using spindles as a palliative option for malignant fractures of the humerus.","6":"Unexpected discovery of ballistic metallic foreign bodies on postmortem imaging examinations.","7":"Comparison between 7 Tesla and 3 Tesla MRI for characterizing orbital lesions.","8":"Retrospective analysis of dose delivered to the uterus during CT examination in pregnant women.","9":"Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma: What the radiologist needs to know.","10":"Right-sided adrenocortical carcinoma with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus.","11":"Writing a successful original research paper for a radiology journal.","12":"A deep learning tool without muscle-by-muscle grading to differentiate myositis from facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy using MRI.","13":"Software-based assessment of tumor margins after percutaneous thermal ablation of liver tumors: A systematic review.","14":"Left ventricular diastolic early and late filling quantified from 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging.","15":"Diagnosis of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy in patients with prostate cancer: State of the art.","16":"Early results of a French care-related adverse events database in radiology: A step toward excellence.","17":"Comparison of peak skin dose and dose map obtained with real-time software and radiochromic films in patients undergoing abdominopelvic embolization.","18":"Gender diversity in authorship in Diagnostic &amp;
