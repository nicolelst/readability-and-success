the concept of followership has existed for several decades and is related to effective leadership, the concept is poorly understood and not well integrated into nursing education, practice and research. This paper reports the findings of a scoping review of 21 articles on followership in nursing. The literature discloses that followership and leadership roles are co-constructed, interdependent and synergistic and influence organizational success and patient safety. The lack of scholarship on followership in nursing is notable and points to the need for a greater understanding of the follower-leader dynamic and effective follower behaviours in the healthcare context.","1":"Registered nurses (RNs) provide abortion care in hospitals and clinics and support abortion care through sexual health education and family planning care in sexual health clinics, schools and family practice. Nurse practitioners (NPs) improve access to abortion not only as prescribers of medication abortion but also as primary care providers of counselling, resources about pregnancy options and abortion follow-up care in their communities. There is a need to better understand the current status of and potential scope for optimizing nursing roles in abortion care across Canada. In this article, we describe the leadership of nurses in the provision of accessible, inclusive abortion services and discuss barriers to role optimization. We present key insights from a priority-setting meeting held in 2019 with NPs and RNs engaged in medication abortion practice in their communities. As scopes of practice continue to evolve, optimization of nursing roles in abortion care is an approach to enhancing equitable access to comprehensive abortion care and family planning.","2":"The nurse practitioner's (NP's) role exemplifies the expertise needed to be leaders, researchers and policy influencers. Academia is called upon to provide teaching environments conducive to engaging scholarship that addresses leadership, research and change management skills. By providing opportunities that focus on political processes and policy development, NP students learn and engage in activities that provide a foundation in the development of political savvy, including advocacy and systems change. Deliberative, dialogue-based methods can enhance knowledge of the issues surrounding the NP role and develop students' understanding of political processes needed for policy change in furthering the NP role.","3":"Little is understood about developing the capacity of healthcare leaders to influence work cultures that promote health and healing. A program designed for clinical leaders to teach them how to create Strengths-Based care environments was piloted and evaluated using mixed methods. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 15 participants from two clinical sites. Evaluation of the data revealed that the program was impactful and that participants had the impetus to influence work environments by shifting their discourse from traditional deficit models of care toward an approach that illuminates a focus on strengths and relational ways of being a leader.","4":"Pediatric nursing expertise in home care requires continuous development and maintenance of competencies. Through the pandemic, practice of essential \"hands-on\" skills was enabled by delivery of training mannequins from hospital to home care and a shift to virtual education. Learners (n = 57) included family caregivers of children with medical complexity and nurses new to home care. Evaluation informed iterative design of the service and signalled \"Connected Care on the Go!\" as desirable (100% highly satisfied), feasible (100% easily implemented) and viable. Now a sustainable service, this nurse-led innovation promotes partnership across leaders, sectors and geographies to address specialized training needs in pediatric home care.","5":"Longwoods Publishing and the Canadian Nurses Association are pleased to welcome your new editor-in-chief of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership!","6":"In this issue of CJNL, we read about research being conducted on vitally important leadership capabilities - including followership, administrative leadership, practice leadership and communication with policy makers - required for nurses both during and post pandemic. These are leadership essentials that are part of our toolboxes as nurses.","7":"This postscript to the issue is a series of reflections by Dorothy Pringle, the previous editor-in-chief, on the contributions Lynn Nagle has made as editor-in-chief of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership over the past 11 years and the richness of the perspectives of the authors of the 18 invited papers. The author also reflects on the contrast between the amount of attention and accolades nurses as care providers have received during the pandemic while having few, if any, nurses emerge as spokespeople or interpreters of the nursing roles and the contributions that nurses have made. Unlike other disciplines and despite their contributions, we have not learned the names of any nursing experts.","8":"The past two years have demonstrated that we are not in a \"new normal\" but in something \"new altogether.\" As a result, incremental change will not be enough to support the nursing workforce now or in years to come. This commentary summarizes a series of cross-generational conversations about the structural change needed to enable nurses to learn, work and lead in the health system of the future. We examine a series of questions (What ifs?) intended to challenge what transformational structural change could look like and call on the Canadian nursing community to collectively lead reform within the profession.","9":"With a global nursing workforce shortage upon us, governments and health system decision makers are becoming alarmed at the potential risk to service delivery if solutions are not found. However, nurses know that what constitutes the fundamental threat to a healthy healthcare system is not the hard work of nursing, but rather the demoralizing conditions under which many nurses strive to practise their profession. This commentary examines the context for some of those conditions and encourages a collective commitment to articulating our vision for the profession in a manner that is sufficiently forceful to be effective.","10":"At this point of time in Canada, growing awareness of the great historical and ongoing harms of colonialism and racism demands that nursing take leadership in decolonizing the profession. Drawing on our experiences as nurses, educators and researchers and as persons who have experienced racism, we call on nursing leaders to deepen structural understanding of discrimination, make a collective commitment and shift away from \"shaming and blaming\" of individuals toward structural and systemic solutions. Action is required in all domains, diversifying and shifting power in every arena; revamping curriculum, practices and policies; and directly tackling racism.","11":"This commentary challenges historic and contemporary issues within nursing and provides direction toward a more inclusive future for nursing. This is a call-to-action for nurses, nursing students and nurse allies to advance effort toward the elimination of anti-Black racism in nursing in Canada. To achieve this, it is imperative to move beyond the performative and adopt practices that enable critical reflection and action. Addressing the manner in which exclusion is reinforced and perpetuated requires interrogation of four distinct yet interconnected processes of racial exclusion and discrimination. Notwithstanding, the future of nursing requires a critical examination of the role of nursing in and relationship with oppressive institutions, including prisons. Abolition, regarded as a radical stance, argues that beyond disproportional incarceration rates, prisons exist within a system of punishment that inflicts long-lasting irreparable mental and physical trauma upon individuals, families and communities. The effects of incarceration on mental, physical and spiritual health is a healthcare crisis that is in direct opposition to the core tenets of nursing and health.","12":"Canada desperately needs more doctoral graduates. We also need more diverse graduates to move into education and leadership roles across the country. This article examines the origins and development of doctoral education for nurses in Canada and the continuing dire shortfall of doctorally prepared nurses to meet the expanding needs of the profession. In the context of this desperate shortage, this article then moves to examine the critical issues of equity, diversity and inclusion and the failure of the nursing academy and the profession to address these long-standing matters. These two issues - the shortfall of doctoral graduates and the lack of diversity in education and leadership in nursing - need to be addressed through a combined and focused strategy if we are to ensure the future sustainability of the profession. Given the decade-long lead time required to effect significant changes in doctoral graduations, the article concludes with a call for a national strategy engaging multiple stakeholders to increase awareness of the issues and their implications for the sustainability of the profession. It concludes that only through the united efforts of the profession will Canadian nursing be able to ensure that nursing education will produce a sufficient number of graduates for the needs of education, practice and policy across the country and that these graduates will better reflect the diversity of the nursing profession and the Canadian population, overall.","13":"Calls for national-level chief nursing officers are over a century old. However, global uptake of these roles and Canadian opportunities for nurses to lead in federal health policy environments have been limited. The absence of such a role in Canada limits connection to global activities, reduces Canadian capacity to participate as a member state in World Health Organization-led nursing activities and, within our borders, leaves the healthcare system without national leadership to coordinate and liaise with senior nurses across our provinces and territories for the benefit of our citizens and systems. In this article, a brief history of global advocacy for state or national level chief nursing officer roles and examples of federal chief nursing officers, in the Canadian context, offers a consideration of the unique contribution of nursing knowledge and leadership to health policy - extending arguments for nursing leadership in the policy arena beyond traditional arguments of strength in numbers or unique claims to caring. Findings from a Canadian national project by the Global Nursing Leadership Institute further illuminate the concrete steps we need to take toward enabling full-spectrum nursing leadership in policy, where policy science, political competency, identification of policy nurses and a revitalization of organizational structures across the country can extend the vision for nursing leadership in policy beyond a single seat at a single table.","14":"After decades of growth and relative stability in professional nursing across the country, events of the past decade have generated unease across the profession as the very existence of some of our institutions is threatened. In this commentary, we describe factors leading to the erosion of historic membership models that were the backbone of professional nursing representation in Canada. We argue that clinging to old models of jurisdictional representation will not be fiscally sustainable in an all-voluntary membership model and suggest principles we believe could underpin a strong, united and pan-Canadian professional association representing all nurses in Canada.","15":"Globally, healthcare systems have been pushed to the breaking point. The demands for public health and community-based care - traditionally underfunded - have escalated. Necessity expedited the use of technology for virtual care delivery within the Canadian healthcare system and in post-secondary education, overcoming years of resistance. Now, more than ever, transformation of nursing curricula is critical to the socialization of our professional identity, what nursing values and what it means to be a nurse who can demonstrate capabilities that go far beyond the image of the pandemic proclamations of nurses as heroes (Goodolf and Godfrey 2021). Sustaining the changes that have supported access to healthcare delivery and post-secondary education throughout the pandemic will require vision and leadership. It will mean positioning nursing within the health professions to have a voice of influence, be visible, be recognized as essential to decisions that affect health and inform healthcare directions that are equity oriented and grounded in the social determinants of health and social justice.","16":"Given the nursing shortage, nurse educators and leaders are responsible now more than ever to advocate for baccalaureate education as an entry-to-practice requirement for registered nurses. The world today is complex, with population health issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, high patient acuity and climate change. Accordingly, a nursing workforce that receives high-quality education is required. In this paper, an overview is provided about the evolution of a baccalaureate degree in nursing as an entry-to-practice requirement. We highlight evidence about patient outcomes associated with baccalaureate-prepared nurses, identify gaps and examine the nature of workplace environments in optimizing contributions stemming from baccalaureate-prepared nurses.","17":"Expedited in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtualization of healthcare is becoming an inevitable norm. While this conveys hope for improving health systems performance, inequitable access could result in consequences that intensify health disparities and increase the burden on the health system. Nurse leaders are optimally positioned to tactfully influence policy directions on virtual care and shape a comprehensive research agenda that includes virtual nursing care in all domains of practice. With virtual care advancing into the mainstream, it is time to mind the health equity gap and co-design virtualized care that ensures the needs of all are met.","18":"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of virtual care in healthcare contexts globally, inclusive of nursing care. Along with the rapid adoption of virtual care by the nursing profession, reflections regarding how best to leverage virtual care in nurse-patient relationships and as an innovative model of care have begun to emerge in both the literature and nursing discourse. Subsequently, the purposes of this paper are to (1) provide a reflection on the significant innovation in virtual care in nursing that was established during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) suggest future strategic directions for the profession in order to retain the benefits related to virtual care becoming more widely adopted into various nursing roles and activities. It is hoped that through this reflection and presentation of strategic directions, nurses and their associated leadership can identify viable future pathways to help evolve the use and delivery of virtual care in the profession for a post-pandemic world.","19":"Advanced practice nurses' (APNs') role definition, education, regulation, scope of practice, working conditions and integration vary worldwide. Clarity and alignment of foundational APN tenets can strengthen future workforce harmonization, innovation and models of care and data reliability for discussions and decision making. This global clarity and consistency can inform the design, delivery and leadership aspiring for health, education and socio-economic systems. Healthcare demands related to the COVID-19 pandemic, opioid crisis, aging population, non-communicable diseases, natural disasters and climate change have exposed glaring health needs and taxed workforces' and service capacity locally and globally. A fulsome deployment of nurse practitioners is one strategy that could help mitigate the impacts of these forces.","20":"The complexity of nursing in Canada is evident in the diverse designations and jurisdictional approaches to legislation and regulation of the profession. The ever-evolving scope of practice of each designation of nursing shows the ability of nursing and nurses to adapt to the external environment and evolve to meet the needs of clients, the profession and the healthcare system. This commentary highlights the \"made-in-Canada\" research regarding intraprofessional collaboration. It also presents recommendations to strengthen intraprofessional collaboration over the next decade.","21":"While nursing is a profession built on collaborative relationships, a lack of unity and historically disparate power structures have become entrenched within the profession during our long history. We are still having many of the same conversations today about the state of the profession as we were 30 years ago. If we want nurses graduating today to enjoy vibrant careers that will see them holding different sorts of conversations about the profession in 2040, then a blueprint for action to optimize intraprofessional practice is required. This paper provides an overview of a recent pan-Canadian report, paints a picture of the current landscape of nursing in Canada and outlines several key strategies to begin transforming intraprofessional practice.","22":"Confronted with a pandemic amid a nursing shortage and an aging and culturally diverse patient population, nursing leaders need to explore innovative ways to meet increasing human resource demands to ensure patient safety. Internationally educated nurses (IENs) are an untapped resource to sustain the nursing workforce and provide culturally appropriate care. Based on the authors' lived experience and knowledge in supporting IENs, this commentary highlights the challenges that threaten the integration of IENs into the Canadian nursing workforce. It also recommends practical strategies to address these challenges, guide innovative and sustainable change and unpack systemic barriers to achieve organizational diversity and equity.","23":"There is a growing concern in education and healthcare that we are not adequately preparing or transitioning newly graduated nurses (NGNs) into the workplace. Several studies over the past decade have revealed relationships between the mental health of NGNs and their experience of the workplace environment. Even before the destabilizing impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, overwhelming workload intensities were forcing nurses to become organizational task masters and crisis facilitators rather than clinical case managers and direct-care providers. This paper outlines numerous practical and evidence-based interventions for mitigating transition shock and assisting NGNs in successfully navigating the stages of transition.","24":"The sustainability of a country's health human resources depends on the supply and mobility of its healthcare workers. Globally, nursing occupies the largest health professional labour group (59%), with a growth of 4.7 million nurses seen from 2013 to 2018, amounting to a nursing workforce of 27.9 million worldwide (WHO 2020a). Despite this increase, it is estimated that the world will need an additional nine million nurses and midwives by 2030 (WHO 2020b). Given these projections, enhanced nurse mobility can be anticipated and expected.","25":"Nursing leaders play a critical role in responding to health human resource challenges. Innovative approaches are needed to retain and support the nursing workforce; recruitment alone is unlikely to address the gap. Actions to robustly support the onboarding of new graduate nurses, ongoing professional development opportunities and creative scheduling arrangements are all required to retain nurses. Shifting to a widened definition of the \"health team\" and a move from the traditionally siloed scope of practice models will require a transformational shift in thinking, and nursing leaders must lead that change. Health human resource planning must also occur in lockstep with population health planning.","26":"Repeated calls to adopt more robust workforce planning, particularly for the nursing workforce, stretch back decades. These calls have generally not been met with action by health system decision makers, and the negative consequences - widespread shortages, even in wealthy countries, and decreased quality of care despite increased costs - have come to pass much as predicted. In contrast to this historical pattern, this paper presents Nova Scotia Health's experience in planning for its critical care nursing workforce during COVID-19 as a case study in integrating evidence-based workforce planning into the operations of a healthcare organization.","27":"The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the underlying vulnerabilities of the Canadian nursing workforce more clearly than ever before. In this commentary, I highlight how the roots of the present vulnerabilities of the nursing workforce lie in part with the complex and adaptive nature of the nursing workforce system. I also propose systemic solutions to address these vulnerabilities through enhanced foundational data on the nursing workforce. These data can be adopted across the range of Canadian nursing workforce stakeholders to create high-quality, interactive and iterative planning, policy and management processes.","28":"For more than 10 years, Dr. Lynn Nagle has demonstrated true nursing leadership as the editor-in-chief of this journal. Her leadership has been evident through her many, many accomplishments, some of which include establishing the Canadian Nursing Informatics Association, induction as a fellow into both the American and Canadian Academies of Nursing, being named one of the top 10 Women Leaders in Digital Health in Canada, being recognized with the CNA's Centennial Nurse Award and designation with a Distinguished Alumni award, University of Rochester - just to name a few.","29":"This is the final issue of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership (CJNL) for 2021, and the final issue for this editor-in-chief. It is with some reluctance that I step away from this role, but I am a firm believer in knowing when your expiry date is pending. When I took over CJNL from Dorothy Pringle in 2010, the task seemed daunting - what big shoes I had to fill - and almost immediately, imposter syndrome took hold of my psyche. But clearly, I forged ahead, and more than 10 years later, I have reflected on my editorial tenure, but more about that later.","30":"The objective of this paper is to describe the day-to-day activities, known as practice patterns, of nurse practitioners (NPs) across a four-site academic healthcare network in Ontario, which comprises acute, primary, rehabilitation and complex continuing care. Information regarding NP practice patterns is available from other jurisdictions and practice settings, but information specific to large, urban and multi-site organizations is available to a lesser extent. This information can inform and support leaders' decisions about NP roles and responsibilities. A cross-sectional online survey was sent to the 125 NPs employed in this healthcare network. Respondents (n = 45) were primarily experienced, graduate-prepared NPs, who work with specialized populations and support the education of healthcare professional trainees. The majority of these NPs' activities focused on direct and indirect care, with fewer activities centred on leadership\/administration, education, research and personal breaks. Clinical care activities varied among NPs and were contextual to the population and program. While direct and indirect care are vital components of NP practice, the overwhelming emphasis on these components indicates that the organization and the healthcare system are losing opportunities to capitalize on advanced nursing practice knowledge and skills in the domains of leadership, research and education. ","31":"Internationally educated nurses (IENs) face multiple challenges in entering and integrating into the Canadian workforce. These challenges include getting to know the Canadian culture, nursing accountabilities, professional practice requirements and experience or qualifications deemed not equivalent to the Canadian standard. Hamilton Health Sciences' (HHS') IEN Integration Project has been funded by the Ontario and Canadian governments to support IENs in overcoming these challenges and contribute to the healthcare system. The aim of this article is to describe a multiorganizational project that prepares IENs for employment in Canadian healthcare. HHS invited partners in education and immigrant support services to co-design the project. A community collaboration employment model (CCEM) was developed to leverage each partner's strengths in targeted interventions to address the needs of IENs, as identified in focus groups. The interventions pertain to professional practice and accountability in the Canadian healthcare setting, workplace language, communication and selected clinical skills. Between project initiation in 2009 and early 2021, 591 IENs obtained employment. Multiorganizational partnerships can help build and sustain a strong nursing workforce, and IENs can fill gaps in care. A needs-based approach and the CCEM increased the likelihood of IEN employment. The ability of the CCEM to engage partners makes it relevant for healthcare organizations. ","32":"Health organizations play a pivotal role during pandemic preparedness, response and recovery. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vancouver Coastal Health, BC, adapted their delivery of mental health and substance use services. Healthcare providers were required to be flexible while continuing to provide patient care. To understand how healthcare providers in the mental health and substance use field experienced the COVID-19 response at their workplace, a quality improvement initiative was designed. This initiative aimed to evaluate their perceptions using an online survey tool that explored their insights related to communication, redeployment and safety and well-being. The survey results aligned with the ADKAR (awareness, desire, knowledge, ability and reinforcement) model of change management, which informed our recommendations to healthcare leaders to support ongoing pandemic response procedures.","33":"Although bullying and racism are often explored separately in nursing literature, this commentary explores how bullying and racism intersect with each other. It emphasizes the importance of clearly understanding the meaning of each concept and argues that a focus on the intersectionality between the two ensures that bullying and racism are addressed not only at the intra- and interpersonal levels but also at the structural level. The authors ask themselves and their readers to reflect on posed questions and to make a commitment not to \"do nothing\" but instead to \"do something.\"","34":"Trauma-informed practices have been widely adopted in clinical, educational and research domains of nursing practice, supporting trauma-informed care for patients and contributing to the knowledge base for trauma-informed care practices. However, trauma-informed concepts and frameworks have not been taken up as readily by nursing leadership in the administration and policy domains, presenting an opportunity for the exploration of the ways in which trauma-informed leadership might shape nursing leadership practice. In this paper, the concept of trauma-informed leadership is defined and considered as a possible direction for nursing leadership practice in the context of the 21st century, wherein increasing complexity and rapidly accelerating social divisiveness require leadership practices that centre compassion, well-being and justice. A real-world example from the COVID-19 pandemic response provides an opportunity to consider trauma-informed nursing leadership in practice as an approach to supporting individual, population and system wellness and resilience.","35":"Notwithstanding the significant representation of social justice as a theoretical ideal of public health nursing (PHN), there is little agreement about how the concept is applied in PHN practice and supported by nurse leaders and organizations. A framework for social justice praxis in PHN was developed after a critical review of the literature to advance the ability of nurse leaders and healthcare administrators to support social justice praxis in PHN. This conceptual framework provides a foundation from which nursing leaders can launch meaningful conversations and make specific efforts toward achieving social justice to improve health equity.","36":"The Canadian Academy of Nursing (the Academy) was established in 2019 to provide a focal point for nursing leadership in Canada that had been missing among the 40+ specialty practice and interest groups affiliated with the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA). More than 41,000 regulated nurses work in formal administration or management leadership roles, and many of them have shared a worrying array of self-identified gaps in leadership skills and development. This article presents an overview of programs being launched within the Academy to help address these gaps and describes other public policy priorities being addressed by the CNA.","37":"In the last issue of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership, authors provided numerous examples of nurse leaders making efforts to address the mental health of nurses in the midst of the pandemic. I personally thank guest editor Joan Almost for leading the collation of the issue and the authors who took the time to share their strategies and learnings. Unfortunately, we are not out of the woods yet, and I hope this collection of papers will continue to provide guidance to our readers for many months to come.","38":"Street nurses who serve people experiencing homelessness and substance abuse are at risk of vicarious trauma and long-term mental health challenges. These risks have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a concomitant spike in opioid overdoses and deaths in Canada, fewer available support services and worsening social challenges. This article describes innovative interdisciplinary and participatory research currently being undertaken to develop and evaluate a multifaceted support program to promote the holistic well-being of street nurses and their front-line colleagues.","39":"Healthcare providers (HCPs) working at point of care with patients have experienced health-, home- and work-related stressors from the COVID-19 pandemic. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic pose particular challenges for nursing leadership, and there is little research to guide them during this unprecedented time. This study was designed to explore how the pandemic influences HCP well-being, professional practice, inter-professional collaboration and the education and supports that would assist them during the pandemic recovery period. The article reports on the qualitative portion of a mixed-methods study, which included 56 HCPs who work in a large mental healthcare facility in Ontario. Witnessing the impact of the pandemic restrictions on patients was a significant source of stress for HCPs. HCPs recommended strategies, such as learning new therapeutic modalities and participating in the redesign of health services as key strategies to support them during the pandemic as these would promote patient well-being. Lastly, the pandemic provided opportunities for HCPs to deepen their understanding of other professions. This awareness was viewed as a strength that could support interprofessional collaboration and enhance health services redesign. The findings and recommendations can assist leaders to address the mental health challenges arising from the pandemic.","40":"The Public Health Branch of the Regional Municipality of York created a specialized team to ensure a people-centred approach for the deployment of the workforce during COVID-19. Due to increasing stress and staff burnout, there was an apparent need for enhanced leadership supports that would expand the skills of managers to apply participative management competencies and resiliency strategies within their teams. A range of leadership development activities were designed that included ready-to-use actionable tools, best practice interventions for resiliency development and comprehensive initiatives, such as mentorship and debriefing. Benefits include manager capacity development resulting in improvements in organizational resilience and psychological safety.","41":"Absenteeism rates among nurses have increased across Canada over the last several years, with work environment challenges and staffing shortages being possible contributors. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have worked under increasingly stressful conditions. Unsurprisingly, many nurses are facing mental health challenges. Digital tools to support and enhance access to mental health services are one strategy to support the mental health of nurses. This paper outlines the digital tools and virtual programs available to support the mental health of nurses, recognizing that there is no single solution to address the mental health challenges faced by Canadian nurses during these difficult times.","42":"The rapid cadence of change and the fear of acquiring and spreading COVID-19 - coupled with moral distress exacerbated by fulfilling one's duty to care under extremely challenging conditions - continue to impact nurses' coping ability, resilience and psychological safety globally (McDougall et al. 2020). This paper provides an overview of how an academic health sciences centre (AHSC) has responded to the evolving waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we share our context and the strategies we used to build and enhance nurse resilience and psychological safety at the organizational, clinical team and individual levels. This is followed by a description of our nurses' achievements amid the pandemic.","43":"The Ministry of the Solicitor General is responsible for Ontario's 25 provincial prisons. On any given day, there are approximately 6,400 persons detained in provincial custody in Ontario, with many staying less than three days.","44":"As a clinical nurse specialist, I provide leadership and strategy for our primary care program where I lead clinical initiatives and develop practice tools and guidelines across our clinics. My portfolio encompasses five clinics, one perinatal program, an opioid agonist therapy (OAT) clinic and an intensive case management team, and in the past year I supported several teams that focus on COVID-19 testing and isolation support. Our clinics specialize in serving people who experience significant economic and social marginalization and those who are not well served by traditional health services. Our nurses, in particular, juggle many roles: providing both outreach- and clinic-based care and supporting our injectable OAT program, youth clinic and our transgender specialty care program. Our work has become increasingly complex as our clients navigate survival with competing syndemics - the opioid crisis, COVID-19, a Shigella outbreak and an ongoing housing crisis - among the many significant structural factors that impact our clients' health.","45":"SE Health is one of Canada's largest social enterprises, providing home and community care to Canadians since 1908. The organization's 8,000 staff make 18,000 contacts with people in their homes, per day, to deliver healthcare services. Registered nurses and registered practical nurses provide assessments and treatments and support patients and their families to remain healthy, stay safe at home, self-manage and be independent.","46":"Loch Lomond Villa is one of the largest long-term care communities within the province of New Brunswick. Our organization supports caring living environments for over 450 clients and their family members along with 354 employees.","47":"In their paper, Stelnicki and Carleton (2021) highlight both the findings of their 2019 survey of nurses' mental health (Stelnicki et al. 2020) and more recent literature published during the COVID-19 pandemic. This response outlines the role of nursing leaders in enabling the mental health of nurses in a mental health and addiction setting, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","48":"Canadian nurses have higher rates of mental disorder symptoms, suicidal behaviour and burnout than the general Canadian population. Exposure to potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs), such as severe human suffering, life-threatening illness or injury and physical assault, can partially explain the decrease in nurses' well-being; however, nurses will continue to regularly face PPTEs as long as they remain in their career. Recent research suggests that operational stressors (e.g., shift work) and organizational stressors (e.g., staff shortages) can also contribute to significant mental health problems. Systemic change is needed to lessen or eliminate the impact of these modifiable stressors. Nursing leadership should advocate for change and solutions to support the mental health of front-line nurses.","49":"Unprecedented is one of the words that has been most frequently heard during the COVID-19 pandemic. We read daily about the ongoing challenges nurses and nurse leaders face in ways that one could not have imagined 15 months ago. With each wave of rising COVID-19 cases, we are reminded of the toll that this pandemic is having on nurses. Nurse leaders have described being scared of failing and not being able to guide or support their staff through the pandemic while recognizing the need to be a strong leader, resilient and adaptable to change every single day (Lapum et al. 2021). The uncertainty and complexity have been overwhelming, and throughout this crisis, nurse leaders have been continually asked to reach into their leadership toolboxes to find ways to support nurses within contexts that have rapidly changed over and over again.","50":"It is time to acknowledge what has been hidden inside Canada's healthcare system for decades but has become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic: widespread stress, mental health problems and burnout in the nursing workforce. For the past 20+ years, repeated concerns about the mental health of nurses in Canada have been raised within many national reports, yet the rates have continued to rise.","51":"Nurses everywhere are called to seek new and better ways of providing care in the complex and dynamic environments where they practise. The core of innovation is the creation of new ideas and use of existing ideas in new ways or in new settings. Today, innovation and fresh thinking are more important than ever as the world is changing rapidly and complexity is the norm. Nurse leaders are called to action to create the insights, cultures, structures and methodologies needed to promote the development and uptake of innovative ideas in nursing practice and interdisciplinary team work. This paper highlights three successful examples of nursing leadership in the development of a culture of innovation at the national (SE Health), provincial (Registered Nurses Foundation of Ontario's Nurse Innovator Awards) and local (Sinai Health) levels. The goal of these initiatives is to cultivate innovation as a way of being, thinking and doing, ensuring that it is inherent in nursing culture and visible in nursing practice, education and research that enhances patients' and care partners' experiences.","52":"In the spring of 2019, Canada's House of Commons Standing Committee on Health reviewed the issue of workplace violence in healthcare and issued a report with nine recommendations. By summer that year, the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions had two active campaigns on workplace violence characterized by a strong social media presence. In 2020, a private member's bill was sponsored to amend Canada's Criminal Code in cases of assault against a healthcare worker. In the face of these developments, we were interested in the framing of the problem of workplace violence by professional and labour organizations in Canada. We examined documents, websites and social media posts from selected nursing unions and professional associations, including both national and provincial organizations. We found that nursing unions and professional associations have distinctive views on workplace violence. We argue that these divergent understandings preclude the creation of consistent and successful political and organizational strategies that would help create safe workplaces for nurses.","53":"The earliest records of critical thinking in Western thought are the teachings of Socrates, as recorded by Plato in the form of the famous dialogues containing Socratic questioning. How would a hypothetical discussion on critical thinking and leadership unfold between these two scholars? Socrates posing questions and Aristotle answering them? And what would this discussion mean to healthcare professionals? Let us find out.","54":"In the field of digital health research, nurse leaders have an opportunity to be integral to the design, implementation and evaluation of virtual care interventions. This case study details the experiences of two emerging nurse leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic in providing research and clinical leadership for a national virtual health trial. These nurse leaders trained and led a national team of 70 nurses across eight participating centres delivering the virtual care and remote monitoring intervention, using the normalization process theory. This case study presents a theoretically informed approach to training and leadership and discusses the experiences and lessons learned.","55":"As we struggle with the impacts of a global pandemic, there is growing evidence of the inequitable impacts of this crisis. In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and\/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all. Adopting a health equity lens is a means of both understanding and stimulating action to readdress the root causes of inequities and work toward a fairer, more just society.","56":"The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressure on a nursing workforce that is already under considerable mental strain due to an overloaded system. Convergent evidence from the current and previous pandemics indicates that nurses experience the highest levels of psychological distress compared with other health professionals. Nurse leaders face particular challenges in mitigating risk and supporting nursing staff to negotiate moral distress and fatigue during large-scale, sustained crises. Synthesizing the burgeoning literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress faced by nurses and identifying effective interventions to reduce poor mental health outcomes will enable nurse leaders to support the resilience of their teams. This paper aims to (1) synthesize existing literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress among nurses and (2) identify recommendations for nurse leaders to support the psychological needs of nursing staff. Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and PsycINFO (via Ovid); CINAHL (via EBSCOHost); and ERIC (via ProQUEST). The rapid review was completed in accordance with the World Health Organization Rapid Review Guide. Thematic analysis of selected studies suggests that nurses are at an increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Younger female nurses with less clinical experience are more vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes. ","57":"After a year of living a masked, isolated, virtual existence, there is much reflection among healthcare decision makers and providers around the world. What have we done well? What could we have done better? And more importantly, how will we ensure that our learnings inform decisions and actions the next time? In this latest installment of crisis leadership papers, authors address the toll exacted upon our profession thus far. Although profound, the psychological sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic are directly related to a number of pre-existing conditions that have been festering below the surface for several years. In particular, blame for the state of health inequities, ageism, staff shortages and workplace violence cannot be ascribed to the pandemic. Rather, each has been exacerbated because of it.","58":"This case study outlines the journey of a home-care organization to support practice change during the COVID-19 crisis. The leadership attributes and organizational structures and processes required for a nimble knowledge-to-action response are explored in relation to client screening, personal protective equipment and development of virtual care. A home and community practice lens was often not evident in the literature or guidance documents. This added complexity to the process of rapidly evaluating evidence and guidance across two provinces and issuing practice direction to a widely dispersed and mobile workforce. A cross-functional clinical response team has been invaluable in the organization's pandemic response.","59":"The initial focus of the COVID-19 pandemic was on the surge capacity of hospitals. Moving forward, however, the attention needs to shift toward keeping people healthy at home. In this paper, we discuss critical insights from the home and community care sector, which shed light on pre-pandemic fault lines that have widened. The paper, however, takes a positive look at how a better future can be built, particularly for those most vulnerable in society. We offer three key insights and analyses as well as examples of how one national homecare organization in Canada, SE Health, is facing the pandemic. We discuss the following key insights: (1) pre-pandemic systemic biases and barriers were exasperated during the pandemic, which impacted the most vulnerable; (2) nurse leaders were faced with unprecedented fear and anxiety from both patients and their staff colleagues; and (3) the pandemic provided an opportunity for significant learning, innovation and capacity development. The pandemic is far from over - we are in a marathon, not a sprint. The paper concludes with how nurse leaders can lead the way in navigating through the pandemic and build a better \"new normal.\"","60":"The \"wobble room\" is a wellness intervention designed to guide staff through unpredictable times that are not going away quickly. Emergency department teams are accustomed to trauma events and trauma debriefing, but the prolonged uncertainties and fears associated with COVID-19 have posed a unique challenge for healthcare workers. The wobble room has become a place where staff can make sense of how the pandemic is affecting them and create a \"new normal\" with respect to personal safety and team cohesion.","61":"At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an immediate priority for nurse leaders was to develop a care delivery plan to address anticipated surges in patient volumes and potential staff shortages. This article describes actions taken to enhance patient care capacity. Strategies included reviewing the competencies of nurses and other health professionals, mapping out redeployment pathways, preparing nurses and other health professionals for redeployment as needed and creating a collaborative care team model. This article includes an in-depth focus on the design, implementation and outcomes of an innovative role for fourth-year nursing students in the collaborative care team model.","62":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented time for leaders to lead. The uncertainty and complexity have been overwhelming, and for many of us, the tools available in our leadership toolboxes have been tested during the pandemic. In my experience, for nurse leaders to best lead during such challenging times, we need to truly understand what the front line needs from us in a crisis. I believe that six leadership practices are key for nursing leaders to support front-line engagement while navigating and leading teams through a crisis.","63":"In Canada, and internationally, in-patient nurse managers' leadership roles during the current COVID-19 pandemic have not been recognized. Yet these nurse managers play critical roles in safeguarding both staff and patients, and inspiring staff to provide complex patient care. This paper describes how 13 acute-care nurse managers enacted and experienced transformational and complexity leadership during COVID-19. This case study of leadership at one multi-site, academic health sciences centre, examined how the first phase of the pandemic impacted the first-line manager's role, the strategies used to navigate organizational and patient care challenges, supports available and overall key learnings about leadership during a pandemic. Results reveal the dual roles assumed by nurse managers during the COVID-19 crisis. Nurse managers in this organization safeguarded patients, families and staff while ensuring 24-hour unit operations. Through leader-staff relationships, managers inspired staff to keep going despite the constant uncertainty and ambiguity. Nurse leaders in this case study exemplified characteristics of transformational and complexity leadership as their roles intensified in the context of COVID-19. Recommendations for nursing and healthcare leaders regarding the ongoing and future pandemics are discussed.","64":"This article outlines how chief nurse executives (CNEs) in an urban regional hospital network are navigating the balancing act of organizational (internal) and system-level (regional and\/or provincial) accountabilities amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Key to their leadership efforts is finding the right balance in making critical decisions and building trust to ensure staff resiliency and safety amid managing their own resilience while enacting both internal and external accountabilities. These accountabilities include having presence and influence at the regional planning, executive planning and incident command decision-making tables. Insights from their experiences and lessons learned will be shared alongside recent calls to action for nursing leadership that can serve as a playbook for CNEs dealing with future waves of COVID-19 and unplanned events.","65":"The intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the mettle of political, healthcare and public health leaders over the past year. Amid the unfolding events, healthcare leaders, including many nurses, have been pivoting, innovating, collaborating, safeguarding, inspiring and navigating - all the while informing the creation of an effective playbook to wage a counterassault for all of us. Despite all efforts, this previously unseen opponent has been unrelenting. Having been in the eye of the storm during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, my memories of the events remain vivid. It was a time rife with uncertainty and fear, forcing the creation of a playbook on the basis of the best evidence and common sense but without the benefit of a precedent. Over the course of several months, our leadership was challenged by efforts to contain the virus and mitigate the very real possibility of a globally emerging pandemic. However, SARS was but a microcosm of the present situation. The COVID-19 pandemic is not like any other crisis we have experienced in our collective lifetime. We can only imagine the toll of this pandemic when it is finally over. It will be measured in terms of post-pandemic posttraumatic stress disorder, deaths from COVID-19 and delayed care, and deaths by suicide among healthcare workers and citizens; in the end, it will not be trivial. Those contributing to the COVID-19 playbook have given their all, and we should be eternally grateful to every single one of them.","66":"A Knapsack Full of Dreams: Memoirs of a Street Nurse, published by FriesenPress in 2019, is an engaging nursing read. The author, Cathy Crowe, is well known for her activism against homelessness and has received many commendations and awards for her work, along with five different honorary doctorates from various Canadian universities. This autobiography offers a critical historical perspective on the evolution of Canadian healthcare from the 1970s until today.","67":"Workplace violence is one of the most complex and dangerous occupational hazards facing hospital healthcare workers today. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that all hospitals have a violence prevention program. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and implementation of a preparedness program to address violent situations in healthcare as an essential component of workplace safety. The foundational program elements are leadership involvement, policy development, organization assessment, response personnel deployment, education, data repository and culture shift. A triad leadership from patient safety, security and nursing led the program. Key implementation lessons involved coordination of change within and across multiple sites.","68":"This article describes a three-year project between nurse researchers, the Saskatchewan Health Authority, the provincial nurses' union and nurses and leadership from two Regina tertiary care emergency departments. The purpose of the project was to create staffing guidelines based on patients' priority care needs. A patient needs assessment tool - the synergy tool - was used to categorize patients' acuity and dependency needs. Staffing guidelines were developed to match patients' needs to nurses' years of experience and classification. Staffing guidelines based on patient needs were compared to guidelines determined by operational budgets. The identified staffing gaps resulted in nurse hires for both emergency departments.","69":"Community Care City of Kawartha Lakes provides primary care through its Community Health Centre, a range of hospice services and numerous community support services. Along with other essential service providers, our organization has continued to operate throughout the pandemic. As a community-based health services provider, we recognized the imperative and the privilege for our organization and the larger home and community care sector to support individuals, especially those most vulnerable due to health status, socio-economic circumstances or isolation, to safely remain at home during the pandemic, in compliance with public health directives. This article describes the strategies and approaches we implemented along with reflections on the leadership practices and principles that emerged. It does not purport to be an exemplar for crisis management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather, it seeks to draw attention to the contributions made by community-based organizations and potentially serve as a case study for debate.","70":"In a high-speed pivot never seen before in post-secondary education in Canada, the COVID-19 pandemic upended every facet of academia. Almost overnight the system transitioned to remote teaching, empty campuses and research stoppages. Nursing school administrators were asked to make hundreds of decisions daily to ensure the safety of students, faculty and staff while maintaining education standards. Several months into the pandemic, circumstances are still far from normal as we continue to expect the unexpected and prepare to be nimble agents of change in the months ahead. This commentary outlines my observations as a faculty member during the past few months.","71":"During my career, I have had many mantras, including \"I love to wonder what will happen tomorrow\" and \"It's all about relationships.\" Well, I have been rewarded in spades because nothing has been predictable or stable about our professional practice environments since COVID-19 infiltrated our organizations. I have been challenged to develop and implement changes at The Hospital for Sick Children - a 300-bed tertiary pediatric academic health sciences centre in Toronto, ON - that we had never contemplated before. I believe that staying true to my leadership values and core principles has been essential when taking on such challenges and staying afloat during these tumultuous times.","72":"Thank you for initiating an important conversation regarding NCLEX-RN implementation and experience in Canada. We are three nursing leaders in the province of British Columbia (BC) with continued interest in the governance, regulation and contribution of nursing locally, provincially and nationally. We hold or have held senior policy positions in BC, including in roles responsible for nursing regulation and practice. It is not our intent to replay the past in relation to the exam; rather, our commentary is intended to position the discourse in the broader context of practice regulation and the roles\/responsibilities of regulators in our country.","73":"In the 1958 musical South Pacific, the character Nelly Forbush trills a song of optimism and hope amid the darkness of World War II (South Pacific Enterprises and Logan 1958). The chipper message of this fictional navy nurse might well be welcome amid the negative timbre of the pervasive political, cultural and societal upheaval that we are experiencing today - not to mention the burden of a global pandemic. The tune delivers the message of a so-called \"cockeyed optimist,\" staying positive while many are not and being buoyed by the anticipation of brighter, sunny days ahead (South Pacific Enterprises and Logan 1958). COVID-19 has unloaded countless blows to virtually every aspect of the life we once knew; surely, this is enough to leave any cockeyed optimist reeling. Where do we find the strength of character to prevail during times like this? Somehow, good leaders do; finding creativity, courage and conviction to make the most of a bad situation, they rise above it. They show optimism in the face of fear, the unknown and circumstances beyond their control. Instilling abiding trust in their followers, they lead out of the abyss, shining light on new possibilities and opportunities.","74":"Despite the increase in nurse practitioners (NPs) working in primary healthcare, little standardized data are available to understand NP activities at the system level. The Nurse Practitioner Access Reporting system (NPAR), a pilot project underway at 40 family health teams in Ontario, involves NPs recording and submitting standardized codes. The codes are intended to reflect NPs' clinical activities, using an existing physician claim system. The study compared how well data collected through NPAR reflect NPs' activities. The mixed-methods approach was used involving NPAR data, focus groups and time and motion data. All data sources indicated that NPs spent the majority of their time on direct patient care. Qualitative data and time and motion data revealed gaps in NPAR data, for example, codes that fail to capture activities unique to the NP role. Analysis of NPAR, time and motion and qualitative data provided a distinctive opportunity to examine NP-reported activities and patient characteristics; however, NPAR data did not adequately describe the scope or breadth of activities of NPs practising in primary healthcare. ","75":"Expanded nursing roles are being explored in Canada as a means to better support the health of the population, enable access to quality care and contribute to the sustainability of the healthcare system. As Canada embarks on a process of developing and implementing registered nurse (RN) prescribing roles, gathering evidence from jurisdictions with established nurse prescribing is helpful to inform policy development. Of particular interest is literature from the UK, with more than 20 years of experience with nurse prescribing, which identifies the importance of completing graduate pharmacological education and building on existing clinical knowledge and experience. Similar models of RN prescribing education have been adopted in New Zealand and Ireland. Within Canada, the RN prescribing role is still in its infancy, and there is some variation among provinces in the approach to prescribing practices and in RN prescribing education. This paper describes the results of an environmental scan that sought to explore the educational practices of national and international jurisdictions through published and grey literature sources. Findings from this environmental scan will support nurse leaders as they develop RN prescribing regulation and education in Canada and will highlight important areas for further knowledge development.","76":"Despite descriptions of nurse practitioner (NP) implementation, there is little guidance for health authorities on how to address the evolving and ongoing challenges of implementing and sustaining NP roles and practice, particularly in rural and remote communities where recruitment and retention are difficult and professional supports may be limited. This article describes a pathway through which NPs have been recruited, supported and retained in their practice in a large rural and remote health authority. The pathway's main steps were the creation of an NP lead for the health authority and the facilitation of conversations with NPs, which resulted in a new organizational model and a renewable action plan for recruitment and retention. The results are a strong NP leadership presence within the health authority, formalized role implementation within the medical staff structure, sustainable mechanisms for professional support, operational management and the strategic development of the NP portfolio. The experience of implementing and integrating the primary care NP workforce in rural and remote settings through an articulated pathway has provided insights into effective NP integration and sustainment in rural primary care settings.","77":"The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) is a large academic health sciences centre that employs over 4,300 nurses. TOH came into existence in 1998 with the provincially mandated merger of five academic and community hospitals. In addition to the challenges of merging competitive cultures and differing work processes, patient care was carried out at the different campuses through diverse delivery models. This proved to be problematic in the program management model adopted by the amalgamated organization.","78":"In British Columbia, the Nursing Policy Secretariat of the Ministry of Health recently issued a series of priority nursing recommendations, including team-based care delivery models. This paper will describe the data collection and analysis phase of a quality improvement initiative focused on care delivery redesign within three healthcare organizations. The focus of the care delivery redesign was a transition from total nursing care to team-based nursing care. Our leadership-academic partnership used the Canadian Nurses Association's \"Staff Mix Decision-Making Framework for Quality Nursing Care\" to guide data collection and analysis on patient, nurse and organizational factors. Data were collected by nurse-led project teams using a patient needs assessment tool, surveys of nurses' scope of practice and teamwork and an environmental profile tool with nurse demographics and unit\/facility-level characteristics. Findings from one organization's pediatric medicine and surgery units are presented in this paper. Quality improvement data provide multiple opportunities for proactive human resource planning and professional development. Resources and examples are provided to guide others' redesign efforts. ","79":"In the current environment of increasingly complex healthcare needs, evidence-informed practice, stronger partnerships and collaborative foundations with nursing professions, health professions and physicians (referred to as collaborative academic practice) are required to deliver integrated, value-based services across the care continuum. This paper outlines the co-design of a collaborative academic practice model in a recently integrated health system. An overview of key concepts from the literature around professional practice models is provided that lays the foundation for the integrated healthcare system's inaugural collaborative academic practice model.","80":"Over the past few months, in a world closed to face-to-face service delivery and social interaction, we have adapted and, for the most part, realized the importance of being apart to keep us all safe. In the face of the pandemic, we saw emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for all but the most urgent injuries and illnesses drop dramatically. The number of people who failed to seek timely treatment because of fear of exposure to the contagion will never be known. But this also raises the question of how the thousands of non-emergent cases seeking care in Canada's EDs in pre-pandemic times have managed over these past months. Has anyone realized that once and for all, policy needs to mandate changes to ensure appropriate ED utilization?","81":"In healthcare, teamwork is promoted as a means of delivering high-quality care. Although the literature emphasizes the personal responsibility of healthcare workers to work effectively within teams, it is equally vital to understand the role of leaders in supporting teamwork. In a focused ethnography that examined teamwork and its impact on care delivery and job satisfaction for healthcare workers, our participants shared how their leaders impacted team functioning. In this study, we examined these data related to leadership and found a strong daily relational component to team management, in contrast to high-level, strategic recommendations in the literature; this has significant implications for leaders.","82":"Understanding organizational cultures helps leaders focus on the content, context and levels of perspective needed to be successful leaders in the area of nursing informatics. The Minnesota Nursing Informatics Leadership Inventory (MNILI) was developed to expand assessment options and tools in the area of nursing informatics leadership. This article describes the result of the pilot test of the instrument. Using an ordinal Likert scale (0 = not like me to 4 = very much like me), respondents rated 12 leadership skills associated with four types of cultures across four scenarios. Respondents preferred collaborative culture leadership skills across all scenarios and differentially preferred culture-specific skills by scenario. Overall, older and more experienced respondents were more satisfied as leaders (p = 0.003) and more often used a democratic leadership approach (empower and care about all voices; p = 0.012). In three of the four cultures, nursing informatics leaders reported preferred and collaborative leadership skills that matched the scenario. This study provides preliminary evidence for using the MNILI to assess the requisite variety of nursing informatics leadership skills. Further research is needed to understand the dynamic interactions between organizational culture and nursing informatics leadership that are informed by conscious leadership and attention to the requisite variety of leadership skills.","83":null,"84":"Conducting research in corrections can contribute to improved individual and public health. Challenges to gaining entry to correctional settings to conduct research can impede research productivity, delay the launch of studies and inhibit researchers from proposing health research in corrections. The purpose of this paper is to share lessons learned from a large-scale corrections research project designed to develop computer-based learning modules to train front-line corrections personnel about geriatric and end-of-life care. Key lessons learned include the importance of building a team of experts, planning and punting, coordinating with institutional review boards and examining denied applications to inform future planning. To be effective in a correctional setting, leaders in nursing research and corrections nursing must work together within the contextual nature of prisons and jails to advance evidence-based practices for this vulnerable population. These lessons serve to establish best practices on how to access correctional settings and to enable more research in corrections.","85":null,"86":"Correctional Health Services (CHS) became part of the Provincial Health Services Authority in British Columbia (BC) in October, 2017. There are 2,700 clients in BC in 10 facilities, and approximately 60% of these clients have mental health issues and\/or substance use issues. To address healthcare quality complaints and queries for this unique setting, in keeping with provincial legislation, nursing role of the patient care quality specialist was created in 2018. Challenges, particularly related to direct communication limitations due to the security of incarcerated persons, have led to adapted processes, tools and approaches. Numerous collaborations have been established within and external to the CHS in BC, including the Federal Correctional Services and Accreditation Canada, which have resulted in new relationships to better understand client issues, develop policies and support continuity of care between the community and the correctional facility.","87":"Clinical placements in correctional settings offer nursing students unique opportunities for learning mental health and community health concepts, including social justice, restorative justice and the impact of poverty and marginalization on health and life choices. Although there is some evidence to suggest that a small number of nursing programs use clinical placements in correctional settings, relatively little scholarly literature addresses nursing education in such settings, or the implications for nursing leadership when students do have an opportunity to learn in correctional settings. In this paper, we examine the literature that is available on this topic and present the findings of a secondary analysis of interviews with undergraduate nursing students at our nursing program in relation to their clinical placements in correctional settings. Drawing on the students' perspectives, we have found that these placements, in particular, have fostered learning about caring for marginalized populations; themes of hope and restorative justice featured prominently in their descriptions of their learning. Students also emphasized that they learned a great deal about the expanded role of nurses and about caring for marginalized populations. With strong administrative and faculty support, these settings offer students exposure to expert registered nurse mentors who work with clients in an expanded role to facilitate their achievement and stabilization of a broad range of health challenges. They are also role models for students, by showing students that nurses can be agents of hope when working with a diverse client population and their families. We offer recommendations on how to maximize student learning in correctional settings, including a reflection on how to support students' integration of their learning experiences in their nursing practice, with the long-term view that these transformative student experiences have the potential to shape our future nurse leaders.","88":"Atlantic Canada hosts six federal and 18 provincial correctional facilities distributed across the four provinces. All employ nurses and offer significant career opportunities, yet minimal content related to forensic nursing is provided in nursing curricula. Furthermore, there is a paucity of continuing educational offerings for Canadian forensic nurses. This article describes the series of events that brought the practice of forensic nursing to the forefront of provincial news media. Actions taken by nurses in academia and practice addressed the lack of educational opportunities for forensic nurses in Atlantic Canada. One of these actions, a Knowledge Forum, was held to nurture partnerships between nurse leaders responsible for healthcare in correctional services in New Brunswick and nurse educators. The idea was to connect nurse leaders responsible for healthcare in federal and provincial jurisdictions, community liaison nurses and nurse managers working in hospital-based forensic mental health assessment units, and nurse educators, to explore nursing practice within secure environments and the current educational needs of forensic nurses.","89":"This article contains Letters from the Readears.","90":"In this issue, articles that embody the complexity and diversity of nursing care in correctional environments are showcased, highlighting the contributions of nursing leaders from across Canada and the United States. The papers featured herein represent unique educational initiatives, clinical practice contexts and research perspectives. Together their contributions challenge the notions of physical and professional \"hiddenness\" (Goddard et al. 2019) as they unmask the strides being made in the ongoing maturation of this nursing specialty.","91":"As we launch into the Year of the Nurse and Mid-wife, marking the 200th anniversary of Florence Nightingale's birth, there is much to look forward to in 2020. Numerous events and celebrations have been planned throughout the year, particularly with some schools of nursing also marking significant anniversaries. Indeed, in this country and others, there are many accomplishments to be celebrated in the context of the profession's evolution over the last two centuries. We should be proud but remain ever vigilant and appropriately responsive to circumstances that threaten our ability to sustain and effectively evolve into the future.","92":"The Canadian Nursing Students' Association (CNSA) is the national voice of Canadian nursing students. Its goal is to increase the legal, ethical, professional and educational aspects of nursing, which are an integral part of the profession. The association is actively dedicated to the positive promotion of nurses and nursing as a whole. Since the implementation of the NCLEX-RN, CNSA has worked extensively to support nursing students as they write this entry-to-practice examination. On national and provincial platforms, CNSA has implored stakeholders to engage in an inclusive dialogue that results in increased support for nursing students with regard to the NCLEX-RN.","93":null,"94":"This article describes the experience of adopting the NCLEX-RN as an entry-to-practice exam among francophone baccalaureate nursing students in New Brunswick, Canada. The journey between 2012 and now has been difficult, and nursing leadership was necessary to inform key stakeholders regarding the inequities faced by francophone nursing students and to bring about change. Here is a description of the arduous work done by a group of concerned nurses (active and retired) to advocate for the rights of francophone nursing students.","95":"In 2015, the traditional paper-and-pencil entry-to-practice exam in Canada was replaced by a computer-adaptive testing exam, the American National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). As there are two official languages in Canada - English and French - the NCLEX-RN was translated to French. Although initially the pass rates for anglophone writers with the NCLEX-RN were lower than with the previous Canadian licensing exam, their pass rates have now increased. By contrast, francophone writers have continued to have lower pass rates, and a decreasing number of candidates are choosing to write the exam in French. A lack of access to French language preparatory resources is being reported by francophone graduates as one of the contributing factors. Canadian nursing regulators report that they are not responsible for ensuring that candidates have access to preparatory materials. However, given the bilingual culture and heritage in Canada, there is a responsibility to ensure equitable access to preparatory resources to ensure success on the licensing exam. This paper raises alarm about the decreasing number of francophone graduates writing the NCLEX-RN in French and the ongoing delivery of safe, quality nursing care to francophone patients by nurses proficient in the French language.","96":"This commentary presents perspectives of two senior nursing professors who have extensive faculty and leadership experience in both Canada and the United States. To understand more about how the adoption of the National Council Licensure Examination-Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) examination in Canada came to be, the authors conducted conversations with 29 Canadian nurse educators and nursing education and practice leaders. Based on these conversations as well as a review of published materials on the topic, the authors conclude that regulatory leaders failed to involve key leaders and stakeholders from nursing education and practice in this decision, and the resulting negative consequences have been borne primarily by the education and practice sectors. The authors argue that the NCLEX-RN adoption has introduced a misalignment into what had been a well-aligned model of education, regulation and practice in Canada and invite readers to consider the following discussion points. First, the NCLEX-RN has been designed to operate within a healthcare system that should not, by any reasonable argument, be replicated elsewhere; therefore, what are the contextual factors that led to the Canadian adoption of the NCLEX-RN? Second, American regulators stipulate that the examination must fit associate degree graduate competencies and that the additional knowledge and competencies gained at the baccalaureate level are irrelevant for licensure purposes; however, is this a fit for Canadian nursing licensure that requires the baccalaureate degree as an entry for practice? In conclusion, as American higher education in nursing now begins to move toward a competency-based model, further changes will have to be implemented to shape and frame the future of nursing education in the United States, and by extension, the future development of the NCLEX-RN within Canada's distinct historical, social, political and institutional context.","97":"In 2015, the nursing faculty across most of Canada were informed by provincial nursing regulators that the America-based National Council Licensure Examination-Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) was going to replace the Canadian Registered Nurse Examination for our nursing students to become registered as nurses. This change in the exam has presented a number of challenges to both faculty and students as they transitioned from a Canadian exam for the Canadian context to an exam that was originally formulated for nursing registration in the United States. This manuscript examines the differences in the Canadian and American healthcare systems; explores the variations in Canadian and American nursing practice and education; outlines concerns surrounding the use of standardized testing that panders to corporate interests, encourages \"teaching to the test\" and is costing nursing programs and nursing students considerable resources; and explores the controversy surrounding the validity of the NCLEX-RN in both Canada and the United States. This manuscript asks Canadian nursing leaders, educators, clinicians and researchers to question why Canadians have taken on this exam when Americans themselves state that this exam \"gives a false and incomplete picture of practice readiness.\"","98":"The National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) has been the nursing licensure exam in most Canadian jurisdictions since 2015. Nursing faculty across the country have invested considerable effort into understanding the NCLEX-RN, so they could help to prepare students to be successful in the exam. A retrospective study was conducted at one Canadian university to identify predictors of success on the NCLEX-RN. Findings revealed that the strongest predictors of success were a grade point average of &gt;3.5 and a course grade in the community development course. The strong predictive value of the community development course was unexpected, and this suggests that content specifically related to acute care may not play as heavy a role in the NCLEX-RN outcome as previously expected. It is possible that students' higher levels of cognitive abilities, such as application, analysis and synthesis of nursing knowledge, play a larger role in the exam outcome than content-specific knowledge.","99":"Each president of CASN has one \"issue\" on which he or she focuses most during the presidency - for me, it was the NCLEX. Canadian nursing graduates first wrote the NCLEX for entry to practice in 2015. Failure rates were significantly higher than for the previous exam - the CRNE. Although the pass rates have improved, this is likely a result of better practice for writing this type of test. Apprehensions remain about the negative impact of the Americanization of our Canadian nursing curriculum and the damage that this examination appears to be doing to present and future francophone nurses.","100":"Decades of work by professional associations, regulators and educators have produced an ethical, reliable, robustly educated and regulated nursing workforce that enjoys high levels of respect in Canada and around the world. The officers of the Canadian Nurses Association comment here on the organization's history and changing role in regulatory policy over the past decade during the introduction of the American NCLEX-RN examination as the assessment tool for entry-to-practice for Canadian registered nurses. Facing forward, to maintain a strong, trusted nursing workforce the association remains committed to meaningful collaboration among nursing's professional, regulatory, education and union sectors.","101":"Whenever we approach a policy change or revision, it is important to consider the impact of mental models and path dependency on our ability to consider a full range of options. The need for an entry-to-practice (ETP) or pre-licensing nursing examination may well fit the description of an entrenched mental model that results in path dependency. In this commentary, the objectives and purpose of nursing ETP examinations are explored within Canadian historical context, jurisdictional comparisons are considered and questions raised that could inform a national discussion on why Canada may or may not need an ETP examination for nursing.","102":"The journey to this issue on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) began when the CJNL editorial director received two unsolicited NCLEX-focused manuscripts for consideration to publish. Adding to the growing body of articles and news stories published about the NCLEX since its 2015 implementation in Canada, the two papers revealed that the NCLEX-RN remains a controversial and unresolved issue for our profession. CJNL has long published special issues to focus attention on specific topics. Such focused publication creates a convenient repository of knowledge and information about a given subject, facilitating deeper exploration of the issue and serving as a historical reference point for the topic going forward. This issue continues that tradition by presenting 10 papers that discuss the NCLEX from the perspectives of researchers, policy makers, educators, students and a coalition of nurses that is vigorously advocating for remedies to address the disproportionately adverse impact of the NCLEX on students and especially on francophone writers. As CJNL's editor for policy and innovation, I was asked to serve as guest editor for this issue, and it has been my privilege to do so.","103":"When I learned this book was about to be published, I knew I would want to read it for three reasons: First, I worked with Donna Thomson on Bringing Care Home, a report I chaired for the then Ontario Minister of Health and Long-Term Care Eric Hoskins on homecare in Ontario, and knew Donna to be a dedicated, experienced caregiver and a fierce advocate for caregiving and homecare; second, I am passionately committed to ensuring that the role and importance of caregivers in our healthcare system is valued and supported; and third, I saw that Judy Woodruff had written the foreword. I am a big fan of Woodruff, who is the managing editor of PBS Newshour, a program of which I am a very loyal listener. I had no idea that Woodruff was a caregiver herself and that speaks volumes about the \"hidden army,\" as Woodruff calls them, of caregivers who provide the largest share of care (estimated to be in the area of 70% in Canada) to their families, friends and neighbours. The authors have written this book to help caregivers find meaning in their caregiving experience and to provide them with tools to manage the transition and advocate for their loved ones.","104":"The burden of complex, chronic conditions in Canadian healthcare is growing, requiring more human and financial resources than ever before. It has become increasingly paramount to look for new ways to more effectively manage complex care to meet the needs of patients and providers. Nurse-led models, including advanced practice models, are uniquely positioned to pioneer innovative care delivery methods for patients with complex chronic needs in Canada. A scoping review was undertaken to determine what is known about nurse-led models of care for patients with complex chronic conditions. Nurse-led models of care include not only nurses independently managing complex care but also nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and other specialist nurses. Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews, 35 publications were identified in the search. Although the academic literature was surprisingly limited, our results suggest that nurse-led models are feasible opportunities to better coordinate care of patients with complex chronic conditions. Specific aims of nurse-led models of care focused on patients with more than one condition were identified in the review. These findings highlight the need to continue to explore nurse-led models of care as a strategy to facilitate a more coordinated and systematic approach to chronic care delivery.","105":"Leadership is a critical component of health system performance. This paper describes a tailored leadership development program for nurse managers in an academic health network in Montreal, Canada, developed in collaboration with a university school of continuing studies. This program is aimed toward strengthening individual leadership competencies and developing a resilient nursing leadership community of practice. In total, 26 nurse managers across the health network participated in the program. Senior nurse directors participated by facilitating group discussions with the nurse managers. Program content was developed through a participative process and in direct response to senior leadership participation through online surveys, interviews and focus groups. An experiential learning approach was used to analyze incidents, explore problems and develop projects specific to the learners' context. The present paper describes the development of this program, outlines plans for evaluation and discusses the lessons learned throughout this process.","106":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a stakeholder analysis of the strengthening a palliative approach to long-term care (SPA-LTC) model and refine it based on feedback from long-term care (LTC) residents and their families, staff, researchers and decision makers. We used a mixed-methods design to conduct a stakeholder analysis of the SPA-LTC model that consisted of two sequential components: qualitative focus groups with LTC staff followed by a quantitative survey with key stakeholders. Twenty-one LTC staff provided feedback about the SPA-LTC model after residents relocated to LTC, during advanced illness and at end of life and in the period of grief and bereavement. This feedback helped to guide revisions of the model. According to the survey results, the SPA-LTC model was well received by 35 stakeholders, but its feasibility was questioned. The Canadian SPA-LTC model is evidence based and endorsed by LTC staff and stakeholders. Efforts are needed to determine the feasibility of implementing the model to ensure that residents' needs are made a priority while in LTC. ","107":"The goal of this scoping review was to identify existing palliative models in long-term care (LTC) homes and differentiate between the key components of each in terms of training\/capacity-building strategies; resident, family and staff support; and advance care planning (ACP) and goals-of-care discussions. We conducted a scoping review based on established methods to summarize the international literature on palliative models and programs for LTC. We analyzed the data using tabular summaries and content analysis. We extracted data from 46 articles related to palliative programs, training\/capacity building, family support, ACP and goals of care. Study results highlighted that three key components are needed in a palliative program in LTC: (1) training and capacity building; (2) support for residents, family and staff; and (3) ACP, goals-of-care discussion and informed consent. This scoping review provided important information about key components to be included in a palliative program in LTC. Future work is needed to develop a model that suits the unique characteristics in the Canadian context. ","108":"Amid the profile of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) and a prevailing interest to support living until death, discussions of appropriate care and care settings for dying abound. The when and how of easing the passage from this corporeal being to a state of other being, whatever you believe that to be, has been focal in healthcare discussions in recent years. I remember a time when the notion of \"palliative care\" was somewhat novel, in later years when a family member was the recipient of excellent end-of-life care, but still many recent instances in which we, \"the system\" fail to ensure that that final life journey is aligned (as much as possible) with a person's final wishes. Alas, a 2013 survey by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) showed that a majority of Canadians preferred to die at home, but few (15%) died outside of a hospital (CIHI 2018).","109":"The electronic medication administration record (eMAR) has been used in hospitals and acute care facilities in Canada for over a decade. Unfortunately, the Canadian continuing care sector has been slow to adopt eMAR usage. Medication delivery in long-term care has traditionally been through paper-based orders and manual documentation in the paper medication administration record. The effectiveness of this manual system as it relates to medication incidents, patient safety and nursing efficiency is not well understood because most of the information is based on anecdotal evidence. Peer-reviewed scientific literature supports the premise that the eMAR, compared to the MAR, is more efficient, significantly reduces medication incidents, promotes patient safety and improves workflow efficiency. In April 2016, the Brenda Strafford Foundation committed to implementing the eMAR at each of our three long-term care facilities to improve medication delivery, reducing and eliminating medication incidents and evaluating the benefits of the electronic system. Under the direction of the clinical team, including nurses, physicians, pharmacists, and the software provider\/vendor, an electronic system was developed and new processes for medication delivery were instituted within eight months of starting the project. Since the past year, the evaluation of the eMAR at the Brenda Strafford Foundation demonstrated a reduction in medication delivery time allowing for more time for direct care and a decrease in medication incidents, which directly affects resident health and safety. Nursing and the healthcare aides trained in medication management were surveyed and indicated that the eMAR provides a holistic view of the resident and provides important information readily available to improve the quality of resident care.","110":"Nurse managers play a significant role in the way care is provided by point-of-care nurses. Yet it is unclear what role nurse managers have in supporting nurses in using health information technologies (ITs) specifically. The objectives of this article are to (1) uncover the role of nurse managers in supporting point-of-care nurses to optimally use health ITs and (2) identify strategies that nurse managers can employ to support point-of-care nurses in using these technologies. A scoping review methodology was used, which resulted in the inclusion of 10 relevant articles. Concerning the role of the nurse manager, four themes were identified: (1) decision making, , (2) implementation planning, (3) supporting staff and (4) evaluation. With regard to strategies to support the use of health ITs, two themes were identified: (1) strategies that prepare nurse leaders in their role of supporting point-of-care staff in using health ITs and (2) strategies that directly support point-of-care staff in using health ITs. The results of this review will be of interest to nurse leaders, informatics researchers and nurse informaticians.","111":"Purpose of the paper: To describe the development of a testable conceptual model that examines the relationship between implementation leadership characteristics and nurses' use of mobile health technologies (mHealth) as part of their nursing practice. The model is currently being tested in the pan-Canadian context. Primary concepts and issues to be addressed: The 2014 and 2017 Canada-wide surveys of nurses' use of technologies reported seemingly low rates of mobile technology use: 3% in 2014 and 7% in 2017(Canada Health Infoway 2014, 2017). The agenda to increase the use of mHealth by nurses persists, though understanding of nurses' use of mHealth remains underexplored. Nurses' usage of mHealth has primarily been examined using technology acceptance models, which are limited in their ability to account for unique aspects of nursing practice. The Nurse LEADership for Implementing Technologies (Nurse LEAD-IT) - mHealth (Nurse LEAD-IT - mHealth) model draws concepts from implementation science, computer science, organizational behaviour, information science and nursing to develop a testable conceptual model. The model facilitates examination of the relationship between nurses' use of mHealth and leaders' implementation characteristics (proactivity, knowledge, support and perseverance) and technology acceptance (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use), while controlling for factors that influence technology use (previous experience and voluntariness of use) and nurses' acceptance of evidence-based practice (age, gender and education). Significance and\/or implications for nurse leaders: The Nurse LEAD-IT model can aid in delineating the pragmatic skills and knowledge necessary for nursing leaders to successfully implement mHealth initiatives in nursing practice settings. Use of mHealth in Canadian nursing settings remain in the emergent stages; results from the testing of this conceptual model will be timely and important in informing current and future strategies by nursing leaders to best situate the development and implementation of mHealth for successful uptake and usage in nursing. ","112":"The use of electronic documentation systems (EDS) has the potential to ensure timely, up-to-date and comprehensive patient health-related information is available and accessible to nurses regardless of their physical location. Despite the benefits of EDS, nurses' low intention to use such systems is well documented, which may predict behavioural usage. Further, limited knowledge exists about nurses' intention to use EDS in the context of home care. The aim of the study was to examine factors that influence nurses' intention of using EDS in home care practice. The conceptual model framing this study is adapted from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A cross-sectional design was used. Nurses (N = 217) currently practicing within the home care sector in Ontario participated in the study. An online survey using adapted and psychometrically sound quantitative instruments was administered. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear regression. Performance expectancy, attitude, social influence and facilitating conditions had significant, positive and direct effects on nurses' behavioural intention. Effort expectancy and nurses' individual characteristics (i.e., age, level of education and technology experience) were not found to have a direct and\/or moderating influence on nurses' intention to use EDS in home care practice. Theory, practice and research implications for the findings are presented and discussed.","113":"In this poem, the author considers healthcare technology from the perspective of the patient, and of the nurse.","114":"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare delivery has not only provided a glimpse into an enhanced digital future but also raised significant concerns about the social and ethical implications of this evolution. Nursing leaders have a critical role to play in advocating for the just and effective use of AI health solutions. To fulfill this responsibility, nurses need information on the widespread reach of AI and, perhaps more importantly, how the development, deployment and evaluation of these technologies can be influenced.","115":"Big data using data science methods (data analytics) has the potential to effectively inform strategies to address complex healthcare challenges. However, this potential can only be realized if healthcare professionals have the requisite depth and breadth of knowledge (i.e., informatics competencies). With the emergence of electronic health records (EHRs - commonly known as clinical information systems [CISs]) in healthcare organizations, data analytics that can \"interrogate\" CIS big data are now possible. In its digitized form, CIS healthcare data meant to support real-time, evidence-based practice decisions and guide new health policy directions remain more of a conceptual promise than a practice reality. Further, the \"data rich information poor\" phenomenon existing with today's CISs is often the reality for nurses who document more patient information compared to other healthcare professionals and get negligible results in return. However, data science methods when applied to CIS big data are \"uncovering\" new evidence currently unavailable through traditional data analytic approaches. Big data science is predicted to provide immense opportunities for nurse leaders by offering robust, electronic tools, which support informed decision-making at corporate tables and \"arm\" all point-of-care\/service clinicians with real-time evidence. In this article, we provide a perspective on how the field of data science can enable informatics-savvy nurse executives to lead clinical transformation in the development of the next generation of evidence-based practice, \"practice-based evidence.\"","116":"The importance of nursing informatics (NI) is highlighted because of changing healthcare landscapes in response to rising digital health and technology integration and use. However, NI education, competency requirements and roles are not standardized across the world, and the potential of NI is modestly understood internationally. This paper explores opportunities and challenges in NI discussed in a panel at the 14th International Congress on Nursing and Allied Health Informatics. The panel was organized by the International Medical Informatics Association's - Nursing Informatics Working Group's Student and Emerging Professionals group. Discussions during the panel session were synthesized and analyzed using content analysis. Results indicate that challenges in NI education, career opportunities and roles continue to exist across healthcare settings and regions. Findings suggest that the following issues need attention: (1) collaboration to build stronger infrastructure to guide NI education, research and practice; (2) improved visibility and appreciation of NI; and (3) greater dissemination of evidence of NI in various health settings. This paper offers recommendations for nurse leaders on strategies to address these issues in NI at the local, regional and global levels.","117":"The editor-in-chief provides an overview of this issue's focus on nursing leadership and digital health. She encourages nurse leaders to be knowledgeable and engaged in digital health initiatives.","118":"Feelings of empowerment in nursing staff can contribute to increased job satisfaction, improved quality of care and a higher retention rate within healthcare organizations. Nursing is critical at healthcare organizations, with direct and significant impact on the quality of care provided; yet, nurses often feel undervalued for the work they do. The strength-based approach of appreciative inquiry is one way to engage individuals in finding collective value through the identification of successes, enabling the creation of a shared vision and strategy for the future.","119":"There has been limited attention to ethical leadership for formal nurse leaders around the world. Assuming that codes of ethics provide meaningful standards of what is expected of health professionals, what specific guidance for ethical leadership is available to formal nurse leaders in national nursing codes of ethics? We conducted an integrative review of national nursing codes of ethics for 131 member countries of the International Council of Nurses (ICN). In the ICN Code, nurse managers\/leaders are highlighted for their role in ethical practice. With the exception of the US, no other country code focuses as much attention on formal nurse leaders. While all country codes (except the United States) implicitly group nurses, practitioners and managers together, most codes do not provide meaningful guidance for formal nurse leaders. The level of ethical guidance provided to formal nurse leaders in national nursing codes of ethics is lacking. However, creating a separate code of ethics for formal nurse leaders is not the answer. Rather, including specific guidance in nursing codes of ethics not only informs nurses about what they can expect of nurse leaders but also allows formal nurse leaders to use the code with their own senior leaders, conveying what their professional body expects of them.","120":"This research examined the role and scope of licensed practical nurses (LPNs) in home care (HC) and case management. Case management is relatively new to LPNs in Alberta having been added to their list of competencies in 2015. The extent to which LPNs are performing functions and the circumstances or criteria that shape their reported case management functions and role are not clear. Our research questions were: a) What roles do LPNs play within HC and case management? and b) What roles could LPNs play within HC and case management given their scope of practice to achieve optimal client outcomes and system efficiencies? We used a mixed methods multiple case study design to engage LPNs in case management practice, their managers and HC leaders from rural, urban and suburban HC offices. Approaches for data collection included semi-structured interviews, participant observation, focus groups, document review and survey.","121":"Scope of practice of nursing roles is continually evolving to meet the ever-changing needs of patient populations and the healthcare system and to reflect changes in legislation, regulation and education requirements. As such, leaders must embrace the impermanence of scope of practice rather than constructing mental models, policies and practices as if the foundation will never change. Impermanence is the only constant, as the complexities within healthcare require that nurses be knowledgeable and flexible to fully leverage our individual and collective contributions to not only our patients but also our profession.","122":"Registered nurses (RNs) enact their scope of practice in everyday practice through the influences of client needs, the practice setting, employer requirements and policies and the nurse's own level of competence (Canadian Nurses Association 2015). A scope of practice is \"dynamic and responsive to changing health needs, knowledge development and technological advances\" (International Council of Nurses 2013). In Canada, RNs' scope of practice is set out through provincial and territorial legislation and provincial regulatory frameworks, which are broadly consistent, but vary across provinces (Schiller 2015). Provincial and territorial regulatory bodies articulate the RN scope through frameworks that include expected standards as well as, in some jurisdictions, limits and conditions upon practice (British Columbia College of Nursing Professionals 2018), and which are commonly referred to as a licensed or registered scope of practice. Rural and remote practice is starting to be explicitly acknowledged within nurses' legislated scopes of practice through the identification of certified practices for RNs in specific rural and remote practice settings, following approved education (British Columbia College of Nursing Professionals 2018).","123":"Over the past two decades in Canada, licensed or registered practical nurses (LPNs) have experienced an extension of their educational preparation and scope of practice. Simultaneously, there has been an increase in the number of LPNs employed in rural and remote communities. These changes have influenced the practice environment and LPNs' perceptions of their work. The aim of this article is to examine what factors predict rural and remote LPNs' perceptions of working below their legislated scope of practice and to explore their perceptions of working below scope. The findings arise from a national survey of rural and remote regulated nurses, in which 77.3% and 17.6% of the LPNs reported their practice as within and as below their legislated scope of practice, respectively. Three factors, age, stage of career and job-resources related to autonomy and control, predicted that LPNs would perceive themselves to be working below their scope of practice. These results suggest that new ways to communicate nurses' scope of practice are needed, along with supports to help rural and remote LPNs more consistently practice to their legislated scope of practice. Without such changes, the LPN role cannot be optimized and disharmony within rural and remote settings may be exacerbated.","124":"Within Canada, nurses' scope of practice is varied between jurisdictions, often poorly understood and way too often defined on the basis of tasks. Nurse leaders generally recognize that defining the practice of nurses solely on the basis of tasks only serves to devalue the critical thinking and evidence-base of the profession. But nurses themselves have also frequently fallen into the trap of delineating their practice in terms of tasks and time. An unfortunate outcome of this task orientation is a lack of appreciation for the full breadth of nurses' knowledge and scope of practice capabilities. In the extreme, (as I recently read in a letter to the editor) this leads to the conclusion that one doesn't need a university education to be a nurse - hospital-based training schools did the job just fine.","125":"A commitment to best practice guidelines (BPGs) is crucial for ensuring the safety of patients. Recognizing the power of information technology, Humber River Hospital has integrated BPGs into the electronic medical record (EMR) infrastructure. The large-scale implementation institutes a uniform standard of care and ensures adherence to BPGs through a forcing function designed to require nurses to complete and document the necessary assessments. The initiative strengthens the audit process and provides the opportunity to identify long-term trends. The implications of the quality improvement initiative are discussed. Due to the widespread use of EMRs, the replication of this initiative is economically feasible in other healthcare settings.","126":null,"127":"With the increasing development and integration of information and communication technology (ICT) into hospitals, there remains a lack of understanding of the impact of these technologies on the hospital's largest core users: nurses. Humber River Hospital (HRH), one of the first hospitals to completely integrate technology across all hospital systems and workflows, has sought to understand how ICTs have transformed the clinical working environment. The aim of the study was to achieve a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of nurses practising in North America's first digital hospital. The methodological approach was informed by van Manen's hermeneutic phenomenological methodology. Data were gathered through in-depth semi-structured interviews with eight nurses at HRH. Thematic analysis was conducted using the van Manen and Colaizzi methods of data analysis. Six thematic categories that formed the nurses' lived experiences of working in a digital environment were identified: safety, time, teamwork, technology failures, patient responses and adapting. Nurses at HRH identified six themes regarding their lived experiences working in a fully digital hospital that provide an insight into nurses' values and cause us to reflect on how we might use this information to further support nursing practice in the fully digital environment. Nurses at HRH seem to have normalized the nursing process within the fully digital environment. Technology appears to be viewed by nurses at HRH within the premise of nursing as an art, allowing patient responses to be acknowledged and incorporated into nursing workflows, and as a science, permitting safe care delivery. Overall, nurses perceived technology as being essential for patient safety and facilitating nursing practice. These findings offer insight into nurses' perception of ICTs, and as technological advancements continue to emerge, these findings will inform education, practice and policy. ","128":"Nurses are disproportionately prone to experience incidents of violent victimization. Despite the vast literature on violence in healthcare settings, few studies have identified effective violence prevention interventions. The aim of the study was to explore the experiences of nurses regarding the implementation of technology-based violence prevention interventions. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured focus groups and interviews with 11 nurses at Humber River Hospital. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and subjected to a content analysis to identify core themes from the data. Three themes were identified: reassurance of safety, an increase in proactive measures and limitations of technology. Nurses held positive perceptions of the impact of technology-based interventions on violent incidents. The interventions were regarded as effective for the detection of potentially violent patients as well as for providing assistance from security staff when a violent incident occurs or appears imminent. However, nurses also acknowledged that patient-related violence was \"unavoidable\" and that technology cannot fully prevent violence from occurring. The findings from this study support the replication of these interventions in other healthcare facilities. Engaging staff, patients and families in this unique digital and technology-enriched environment has been critical for the successful implementation of the violence prevention electronic flagging system. Patient and family education and communication were essential for addressing concerns related to \"labelling.\" ","129":"Integrated bedside terminals (IBTs) were implemented at Humber River Hospital with the goal of supporting patient independence and autonomy and improving nursing workflows. The IBTs provide access to a range of convenience and entertainment services as well as access to personal health information. Due to the novelty of the technology, there is a paucity of empirical data on patients' use of, satisfaction with and perceptions of bedside terminals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of IBTs on patient empowerment and nursing workflows. A mixed methods design was employed using a cross-sectional patient survey and semi-structured interviews with nurses. The patient survey assessed patient empowerment and satisfaction with the range of services offered through the IBT. Patient scores were summarized using descriptive statistics. Additionally, face-to-face interviews with nurses were used to illicit feedback regarding the IBTs' impacts on nursing workflows. In total, 113 patients and 11 nurses participated in the study. Analysis of patient satisfaction surveys indicated that the IBTs enhanced the patient experience and increased self-care management. Nurses reported that the IBTs helped patients feel comfortable and entertained and helped enhance the nurse-patient relationship. However, nurses also expressed concern that elderly patients were less inclined to use the IBT. The results from the present study suggest that the IBT system has the potential to empower patients and decrease demands on nurses. Patients' notes incorporated into the IBT may provide the necessary level of involvement to garner a greater sense of patient empowerment. The IBT does not replace the need for nurses to deliver information to patients in a manner that supports their trust. ","130":"Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing field with the potential to transform healthcare delivery. Smartphone technologies have been developed and integrated into the patient call bell system for healthcare staff to receive calls; however, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support the implementation and evaluate the effectiveness of these devices in a healthcare setting. The aim of this study is to explore nurses' perceptions of smartphone technology devices in enhancing the nurse-patient relationship and improving nursing workflows. A semi-structured focus group and interviews were used to illicit nurses' experiences with smartphone technology. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and subjected to a content analysis to identify emerging themes from the data. Interviews with nurses provided insight into the benefits and challenges of smartphone use in the clinical setting. Multiple benefits were identified by nurse participants, including time management and convenience, prioritization, patient safety and enhancement of the nurse-patient relationship. There are multiple benefits of smartphone technology for both nurses and patients. Hospitals proposing to introduce smartphone technology need to educate patients and families about the clinical use of smartphones to avoid unfavourable perceptions. Smartphone technology must be interoperable with the electronic medical record to optimize interprofessional communication and exchange of patient information. ","131":"Healthcare organizations have long been dependent on the vigilance of nurses to identify and intercept medication errors before they can adversely affect patients. New technologies have been implemented in an effort to reduce medication errors; however, few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of technology-based interventions in reducing medication errors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of barcode medication administration (BCMA) and the closed-loop medication system (CLMS) interventions on medication errors and adverse drug event (ADE) rates. An autoregressive integrated moving average model for interrupted time series design was used to evaluate the impact of the BCMA and CLMS interventions on the monthly reported medication error and ADE rates at Humber River Hospital between September 2013 and August 2018. Descriptive statistics were generated to evaluate the types of error and their gravity. A total of 1,712 medication errors and ADEs were reported in the five-year study period. The results of the interrupted time series indicated that the introduction of the BCMA intervention was associated with a statistically significant gradual decrease in reported medication error and ADE rates at 0.002 percentage points per month (p = 0.003). The introduction of the CLMS intervention was associated with an immediate absolute decrease in reported medication error and ADE rates of 0.010% (p = 0.020). The findings from this study support the adoption of both BCMA and CLMS interventions to prevent medication errors. Staged implementation of CLMS allows time for learning and incorporating barcode scanning. Interprofessional and cross-functional collaboration is necessary to successfully integrate the requirements of each respective discipline and service in the CLMS. ","132":"In the fully digital practice realm, a new relationship has emerged between nurses, patients and technology. Nursing leadership in this unique practice setting requires new and enhanced skills, knowledge and abilities. Maintaining the principles of patient and family centredness, attentiveness to nurses' concerns regarding workflows and involvement of nurses in the design of technologies is critical for creating a safe, professional practice environment in the fully digital hospital. Technology cannot replace the humanness of caring. Mindfulness of the digital impact on the therapeutic relationship is necessary. Competency in technology is the new proficiency that nursing leaders will need to acquire.","133":"Happy Nursing Week! In this special issue of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership for Nursing Week, you will find much food for thought. This issue may surprise you while you ponder the workings of Humber River Hospital, the first fully digitalized hospital in North America. Dr. Vanessa Burkoski and her team of researchers present their findings and insights related to the various technologies and the ways in which they impact nurses' work and patients' experiences of care. I imagine you will read with anticipation the ways in which digital health care practices have transformed nursing practice and the patient experience at Humber River Hospital.","134":null,"135":"The provision of MAiD will be in flux for a few years, as legislative challenges are underway. This article addresses what leaders need to know and do to support nurses today and in the future regarding care of patients choosing MAiD. Drawing on complexity leadership theory and research into nurses' experiences in caring for persons choosing MAiD, we share 10 simple yet foundational things a leader must know. Underpinning our key messages are current evidence and familiar nursing concepts such as end-of-life care, death trajectories, conscientious objection, scope of practice, ethics, sense-making and care cultures. These key messages are embedded in a framework of leadership practices where attention to inter-relationships, emergence and innovation are highlighted. They provide nurse leaders with concrete actions to inspire a team dynamic for creating inclusive cultures of quality care. Leadership is needed across healthcare settings where MAiD is being enacted.","136":"In 1987, six Canadian community health nursing leaders recognized the need for a national body to represent and advocate for the diverse practice of community health nursing and the health of communities. Their vision and action three decades ago resulted in the formation of the Community Health Nurses of Canada (CHNC), a national professional nursing association. This paper will describe the development of CHNC from an early vision to a recognized centre of excellence for community health nursing in Canada. Significant milestones described include developing structures to advance excellence in practice, creating and acting on a vision, advancing leadership capacity, supporting professional development and promoting best practice, advancing community health nursing in undergraduate education and advocating for health policy.","137":"Nursing leadership is a journey that begins in nursing school. Whether it is at the diploma, baccalaureate or graduate level, nurses and nursing students are provided the tools to develop and refine their leadership capacity throughout their career. Cope and Murray explain that all nurses have the capacity to be leaders and thus require training that enhances this role. In this paper, I share insight into my personal journey of nursing leadership by describing a leadership development plan that has guided my journey thus far and will continue to guide the remainder of my doctoral studies and nursing practice.","138":"This article highlights a growing gap in the Canadian nursing workforce, specifically in nursing leadership. Black nurses are significantly underrepresented in nursing and even more so as nurse leaders. This commentary will provide a brief background related to Black nurses in healthcare, a description of nursing leadership, the significance of having Black nurses in leadership positions and finally how to move towards increasing the representation and visibility of Black nurse leaders. This commentary is timely and necessary, as it will describe how Black nurse leaders can enrich the nursing profession as well as the lives of Black individuals, families and communities.","139":"Nurse managers occupy a critical position in leading change on the front line of patient care. They are often recruited from clinical roles and possess a wealth of expertise in providing quality client care. However, novice managers often receive insufficient professional development for their complex roles and require support to obtain leadership and management competencies to function successfully. An internship training initiative was created to support graduate nurses interested in management roles to develop necessary skills for success. The initiative focused on an Individualized Role Development Plan guided by a management competency framework and a robust mentorship model that leveraged support from a network of experienced organizational leaders. This paper examines one nurse manager intern's experience in developing both management competencies and mobilizing mentorship support for personal resilience in a mental health and addictions setting.","140":"Nurses, with their intimate knowledge of person-centred healthcare, are called to lead at the point of care and to promote health across settings and the continuum of care. Capacity building and knowledge development for nursing leadership is a current priority in Canada, and therefore, academic preparation is foundational to developing nurses who lead. We provide examples of how to build leadership capacity in undergraduate, graduate and continuing professional development programs. Nurse educators across practice settings need to align educational content and pedagogies with the necessary knowledge, skills and attributes for leading both within and beyond healthcare contexts. Excellence in nursing education and strong partnerships with health sectors will contribute to effective and collaborative healthcare provided through nursing's distinctive lens.","141":"As the world prepares to celebrate the remarkable life and contributions of Florence Nightingale on her 200th birthday in 2020, the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) is putting the pieces in place to host an entire new pillar of programs and services focused on leadership for all regulated nurses across Canada. First among these is our relationship with the Dorothy Wylie Health Leaders Institute (DWHLI), which has built a partnership with CNA since 2015. As a great gift to CNA and nursing across Canada, to mark the Nightingale bicentennial we are thrilled that the DWHLI will come fully under CNA in 2020 as our premier residential leadership development program.","142":"The Dorothy Wylie Health Leaders Institute is a Canadian success story, providing leadership development to over 2,600 nurses and healthcare professionals since its inception in 2001.The authors describe the original design and intent of the Institute and its evolution over the last 18 years as both the context for leadership and leadership requirements have evolved. The Institute's framework, key features, principles, concepts and streams of learning are outlined along with summaries of research on personal and organizational impact. Lessons learned and recommendations are included in the areas of program design, registrant selection and organizational support. This paper will be of interest to those who wish to better understand how the context of leadership in healthcare is evolving and how leadership attributes and behaviours can be developed to meet current and new challenges.","143":"The evolving nature of Canada's healthcare system has necessitated a corresponding evolution of leadership informed by contemporary theoretical perspectives. It has long been recognized that the leadership capabilities, knowledge and skills of the past are no longer sufficient to manage and lead amidst the complexities of today's healthcare system. Events of this millennium have challenged the most talented of leaders to thrive and lead in the face of managing: unprecedented critical incidents and technological advances; a multigenerational, multicultural and interprofessional workforce; shifting scopes of practice and spans of control, never-ending fiscal constraints; and new legislative changes to mention but a few.","144":"The nursing profession has long acknowledged the importance of leadership and like many other professions has been criticized as \"leader-centric.\" The role of leadership is to influence followers towards a common goal. Leaders, therefore, must have a clear understanding of followership, including the factors that promote followers' effectiveness and engagement. They must be able to identify following and non-following behaviours, and they must practice leadership styles that support effective followership. Although nurse authors in the 1980s and early 1990s advocated for the inclusion of followership in nursing education and practice, the role has received little attention. Currently, it is not included in standards and guidelines, and there are few nursing research studies on this topic. Our understanding of leadership is incomplete without also understanding followership; without the following role, there is no leadership role. The purpose of this article is to focus the lens on followership, clarify what it is, outline the different styles, explain the importance of the role to nursing and offer recommendations that guide its integration into the nursing profession.","145":"Around the world, registered nurses are working increasing amounts of overtime. This is particularly true in critical care environments, which experience unpredictable fluctuations in patient volume and acuity combined with a need for greater numbers of specialized nurses. Although it is commonplace, little consensus exists surrounding the effects of overtime on nursing sick time and patient outcomes. Using data from 11 different critical care units nestled within three major academic health science centres in Southern Ontario, a multilevel-model Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between nursing overtime and nursing sick time, patient mortality and patient infection incidents. Most significantly, for every 10 hours of nursing overtime worked, study findings revealed an associated 3.3-hour increase in nursing sick time. Because of the potential cost and patient care ramifications, hospitals and nurse managers are encouraged to track collective and individual paid and unpaid hours to impose appropriate limits and ensure accountability. Further qualitative research should be commissioned to explore the underlying reasons for these findings and diversify the settings and, in turn, wider application.","146":"Aware of the evidence demonstrating how important employee engagement is to patient experience, outcomes and cost containment, leadership at Bluewater Health, Sarnia, was looking for strategic solutions to improve engagement. Work with compassion fatigue and resilience specialists suggested focusing on kindness. This article shares the hospital's experience designing and implementing their campaign - from a core committee that empowers and encourages teams to find their own creative ways to promote kindness, through to leadership's commitment to changing organizational culture. There's even a treat cart! Bluewater Health's employee engagement solution has an aspect of fun that is fresh and innovative.","147":"Against the backdrop of Ontario's \"Inquiry into the Safety and Security of Residents in the Long-Term Care Homes System,\" this commentary offers personal reflections about nursing regulation and the profession. The evolution of the three pillars of nursing is briefly described, and emerging changes in regulatory structures and professional associations are identified. The nature of the relationship between the regulator and the registrant is commented on, and the lived experiences of regulation from the perspective of an employer and a chief nursing executive are discussed. In the context of the examples shared in the commentary and the proceedings of the Inquiry, the author calls upon each pillar of the profession to work together more effectively to protect the public and optimize the contributions of our profession as a whole.","148":"Nursing organizations including regulatory colleges are undergoing transitions that fundamentally alter the face of Canadian nursing. As British Columbia regulatory and professional organizational transitions are held up as a potential model for the rest of Canada, we offer a critical commentary on a most recent transition to the One Nursing Regulator of all nursing role designations in the formation of the British Columbia College of Nursing Professionals in 2018. We draw attention to amalgamation processes - professional regulation and governance, the preservation of nursing history, allocation of nurses' fees and resources and the role distinctions and identities of registrant groups - Registered Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, Licensed Practical Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses. We argue that nursing's collective engagement and nursing leadership in self-regulation and decision making related to professional practice is key to public safety and integral to the identity of Canadian nursing. In our critique we identify issues and raise questions for consideration in the coming years.","149":"Public expectations of safety are a given in all aspects of our daily lives and certainly in the delivery of health services. Can enhanced legislation and regulatory requirements strengthen the very systems established to support safe care and safe practice by those professionals delivering this care? The delivery of health services is a complex matrix of public and private systems and care providers. Individual regulated health professionals play a key role in ensuring safe care as do legislators, employers, regulators and unions.","150":"Identifying poor or unsafe practice is an important aspect of professional regulation. One way that health profession regulators access this information is through legislated mandatory reporting of incompetence or incapacity. Australia's mandatory reporting provisions are far-reaching and have become a touchstone issue in Australia's regulatory framework. In Ontario, mandatory reporting of health professionals is more limited. In this article, we compare the mandatory reporting regimes in these two jurisdictions through a historical and legal analysis examining the development and reform of mandatory reporting. Regulators' access to and handling of information about professionals has been under a critical media spotlight recently. Canadian policymakers and nurse leaders should consider advocating for more comprehensive mandatory reporting regimes with clear reporting structures to improve public confidence in regulation and protect the public.","151":"A registered nurse of questionable professional competence, with a dodgy employment record, a history of mental illness and substance abuse, remains employed and ultimately murders eight vulnerable seniors, attempts to murder four others, and assaults another two over the course of a decade. At least those are the ones for which Elizabeth Wettlaufer offered a confession. Like most nurses and citizens, I was horrified by the revelation of multiple homicides at the hand of one of us. How could such a confluence of incompetence, mental illness and addiction, and willful murder go undetected for so long by so many?","152":"Family practice nurses (also known as primary care nurses) are registered nurses who practice in primary healthcare and function as generalists who provide a broad range of health services, including preventative screening, health education, chronic disease management, care coordination, and system navigation. This paper reports on the current state of family practice nursing in Canada and findings from an environmental scan of literature focused on family practice nursing competency development internationally. Overall, there is a lack of clear information regarding the deployment of family practice nurses in Canada and a lack of clarity about their role in primary healthcare teams. Although family practice nurses play a key role within interprofessional primary healthcare teams, the degree to which family practice nurses have been integrated into primary healthcare varies substantially across provinces\/territories. Our environmental scan indicates that the development of family practice nursing competencies is occurring internationally. The steps being taken to develop a defined set of national Canadian family practice nursing competencies are described and implications for policy, administration, leadership, education and patients are discussed.","153":"This paper presents the development of a mental health and addictions settings-specific Client Care Needs Assessment (CCNA) tool. The process of tool development was completed using a modified Delphi approach. During Round One, indicators reflecting the unique needs of patients with mental illness and addictions issues were identified through meetings with interprofessional teams. During Round Two, an interprofessional mental health practice expert panel further refined the tool via online survey. Round Three consisted of refining and finalizing the tool. The final CCNA tool consists of 31 indicators and 11 questions that are associated with the eight domains of the Synergy Model.","154":"As jurisdictions around the world transform their healthcare systems, the home and community care sector represents both a significant challenge and a critical opportunity for the future. One of the biggest challenges is that home and community care lags behind hospitals and primary care in most health systems in funding, policy, and infrastructure. At the same time, home and community care is an ideal foundation for a health system which is patient and family-centred and provides care options that are delivered closer to home. This article builds on the patient-centred care concepts in an article by Sharkey and Lefebvre (2017) and identifies how nurses can lead the way to health system transformation by working with patients and families to co-design changes to achieve a higher quality, more integrated and patient-centred home and community care system.","155":"As part of the special focus on nursing leadership and quality improvement, I had the privilege of interviewing Chris Power (CP) chief executive officer of Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI); Michael Villeneuve (MV) chief executive officer of the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) and Judith Shamian (JS) past president International Council of Nurses (ICN) and former CNA president around their perspectives of our current context and their collective wisdom on key actions for nurse leaders to undertake to advance the quality and safety agenda in Canada and globally.","156":"To lead effectively within their organizations, nurse executives must possess quality and safety literacy and be able to engage and motivate clinicians to participate in safety and quality initiatives. Given the paucity of research in Canada, a study was undertaken to explore nurse executives' understanding of the key concepts and strategies associated with patient safety and quality improvement, and their engagement with patient safety and quality improvement in their hospitals and healthcare systems. This study used an exploratory qualitative design with a content analysis approach on 20 nurse executives working in hospitals in Ontario. Three key themes emerged from the narrative data set including: (1) being a strategic and system thinker while possessing the emotional intelligence to influence staff; (2) building credibility and relationships with point-of-care staff, board of directors, and leadership team and (3) creating a culture of safety and high reliability. Study findings can be useful in informing future learning opportunities for nurse executives and nurses leaders at all levels to enhance their quality and safety literacy.","157":"Now more than ever with the increasing complexity of care needs and the aging nursing workforce, nurse executives need to embrace the opportunity to acquire and enhance their transformation leadership competencies to advance and accelerate patient safety and quality improvement in healthcare. This paper calls for nurse leaders to engage in authentic, complex and resilient leadership to meet the evolving challenges and advances in technology in healthcare amidst achieving the quadruple aim of improving the care experience, improving population health, reducing the cost of care and improving the provider experience.","158":"The editor-in-chief discusses the central theme of this issue of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership - advancing quality and safety in healthcare. As she explains, authors in this issue represent a range of perspectives and highlight nursing leadership strategies, competencies, and obligations to ensure quality and safety in Canadian healthcare organizations.","159":"While multisource feedback and coaching have shown promise as effective professional development strategies for physicians, the effectiveness of these interventions with nurse practitioners - a growing profession in Canada - remains unknown. Despite this knowledge gap, multiple nursing colleges in Canada require their nurse practitioner members to participate in multisource feedback processes. An exploratory study was performed with twelve nurse practitioners using an online multisource feedback process (based on the CanMEDS Framework) and an in-person coaching session (using the R2C2 Model). Participants were surveyed immediately post intervention and two months later. Perspectives of the coaches and process coordinators were also assessed. Nearly all participants reported that the intervention was valuable for their professional development, and 63% reported they changed an aspect of their practice because of participating. However, the majority of participants reported difficulty finding colleagues who could provide them with valid feedback. This was because of the independent nature of their practice. Multisource feedback and coaching show promise as effective professional development strategies for nurse practitioners who work in collaborative practices. Further research is needed to confirm these exploratory findings. ","160":"Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has the highest prevalence of diabetes in Canada. In 2011, Eastern Health (EH) selected diabetes as its chronic disease management focus in response to national statistics on the disease. In 2012, EH partnered with Saint Elizabeth (SE) to offer a free e-learning module on diabetes management to its healthcare providers. In this paper, the Engage Others domain of the LEADS in a Caring Environment Framework is used to describe the EH-SE partnership for this e-learning including strategies used to engage nursing and allied health staff.","161":null,"162":"Nurse leaders, educators and employers work to address the challenges of providing optimal care to Indigenous people and communities in Canada, which is often further complicated by geography and isolation. The Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association (CINA) has responded to the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada through partnerships with various levels of government, including the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of the new federal department of Indigenous Services Canada, to increase and better support Indigenous nurses in the healthcare system. Grounding nursing practice with the wisdom and strength of Indigenous knowledge, balanced with the perspectives of western ways of knowing is further facilitated when nursing students can be educated and supported closer to home. Learning in a supportive way, closer to where one lives, can allow for important family ties, cultural supports and practices to improve experiences and outcomes for students.","163":"Canadian universities are developing strategies to address the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action. There has been much attention paid to the positivist, individualistic and Eurocentric foundations of nursing and its educational curricula, but limited focus on assessing organizational structures or engaging with stakeholders. Without both approaches, the success of new initiatives may be limited. The College of Nursing at the University of Saskatchewan implemented a \"Learn Where You Live\" model that demonstrated a sense of place by providing access and opportunity in rural, remote and northern regions of the province. Key to this initiative was the creation of the position of Strategist for Outreach and Indigenous Engagement, whose role it is to develop strategic initiatives designed to interpret and influence socio-political and policy-level system changes. This paper shares how adding a political scientist to nursing education created an interprofessional team by introducing new ways of thinking and being that have cultural relevance and understanding for a sustainable future.","164":"A number of universities have introduced Indigenous student-specific programming to improve recruitment. These programs target the needs of Indigenous students and often impart a sense of comfort or belonging that may be more difficult to obtain in a mainstream program. The University of Saskatchewan, College of Nursing, implemented a Learn Where You Live delivery model that challenged the university community to think differently about outreach and engagement. This is best described by redefining distance such that student services and supports would no longer be localized to a main campus but redesigned for distribution across the province. Sustaining this model meant the College leadership had to find new ways to support faculty to engage in teaching and learning opportunities that would be context relevant and aid student recruitment and retention. The new position of Strategist for Outreach and Indigenous Engagement was created to lead opportunities for faculty and staff to gain knowledge and expertise in policy development, negotiation and implementation for success in the distributed delivery model. The framework of Two-Eyed Seeing was adapted to guide the introduction and ongoing implementation (Bartlett et al. 2012).","165":"The practice of nursing today demands that the nurse identify and meet the cultural needs of diverse groups, understand the social and cultural reality of the client, family, and community, develop expertise to implement culturally acceptable strategies to provide nursing care, and identify and use resources acceptable to the client (Andrews and Boyle 2002).","166":"Patient partnership has become a central element of healthcare delivery in many countries. The concept has specific relevance in mental health, as it is a critical enabler of recovery and healing (Bailey and Williams 2014). Patient partnership implies active engagement of patients in shaping decisions at the direct care, organizational and system level (Health Quality Ontario 2017). This article will outline the concept of patient partnership, and highlight the journey of one mental health.","167":"Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, is experiencing a substance use and addiction crisis with devastating consequences. To engage local stakeholders on substance use and addiction issues, nurse researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, Prince Albert Campus, planned and organized a one-day community engagement and knowledge exchange forum. The forum provided the opportunity for interested community groups, members and individuals to share their experiences and to explore novel ways to prevent and respond to the substance abuse and addiction challenges in the region. Participants included community leaders, people and families living with addiction, service providers, local stakeholders, health professionals, researchers and Indigenous Elders. This paper describes the process and outcomes of this event and describes the role of nurse scholars in leading these efforts.","168":"The current overdose epidemic we are facing in Canada and internationally calls on nursing leaders to prioritize holistic and compassionate care for people who use drugs (PWUD) and their families. Nurses are well positioned to provide person-centred care and advocate with and for this population. To do so requires an examination of one's personal values and beliefs surrounding drugs and the people who use them. As a nurse leader, I was forced to confront my views about illicit drug use following the untimely death of my brother Brad from overdose. This paper chronicles my personal experience with his death and subsequent journey into advocacy for drug policy reform amidst an emerging overdose crisis. This short paper is written from my personal perspective, and informed by both personal and professional experiences in drug policy reform. It addresses strategies for challenging stigma and opportunities for partnering with PWUD through engagement in harm reduction.","169":null,"170":"Transitions between hospital and community are particularly challenging for vulnerable adults experiencing behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) of dementia. Too often, miscommunication results in triggering a recurrence of disruptive behaviours leading to frustration of staff and families. As part of the implementation of Health Quality Ontario (HQO) Quality Standards, this project involved improving transitions using an electronic-based care plan on a 23-bed geriatric dementia unit in a mental health hospital. \"My Dementia Careplan,\" is an interprofessional care plan that was developed in the electronic medical record (EMR) to enhance communication of information between healthcare providers when patients are being discharged to the community. It is written from the patient's perspective in collaboration with the family and interprofessional team. It describes strategies to manage behavioural challenges along with the standardized tools to objectively monitor progress. This care planning will help to support transition of knowledge between hospital and community.","171":"The promotion, protection and restoration of mental health are foundational to healthy communities. However, most mental health services in Canada, already underfunded in comparison to hospital-based medical-surgical programs, continue to be focused on providing reactive acute care. Mental health problems in later life often have their roots in the prenatal, infancy and early childhood life periods, and considerable evidence has accumulated about the effectiveness of interventions during this period of time. Although public health nurses (PHNs) play a leadership role in Canada in developing and providing programs that promote mental health in the early years, much of this work is largely invisible. This paper describes the concept of infant and early childhood mental health, identifies key national policies, and explores the role of PHNs in supporting mental wellness for infants and families, in keeping with health equity and Indigenous perspectives. Canadian practice exemplars are provided to highlight the value of investing in the promotion of infant and early childhood mental health.","172":"Mental health and addictions services are integral to Canada's healthcare system, and yet it is difficult to recruit experienced nurse leaders with advanced practice, management or clinical informatics expertise in this field. Master's-level graduates, aspiring to be mental health nurse leaders, often lack the confidence and experience required to lead quality improvement, advancements in clinical care, service design and technology innovations for improved patient care. This paper describes an initiative that develops nursing leaders through a unique scholarship, internship and mentorship model, which aims to foster confidence, critical thinking and leadership competency development in the mental health and addictions context. The \"Mutual Benefits Model\" framework was applied in the design and evaluation of the initiative. It outlines how mentee, mentor and organizational needs can drive strategic planning of resource investment, mentorship networks and relevant leadership competency-based learning plans to optimize outcomes. Five-year individual and organizational outcomes are described.","173":"Five nurse leaders in mental health offer their perspectives on key issues facing the sector and reflect on how nurses can make a difference in the following critical areas: nursing practice, transitions of care, innovative technologies, challenging stigma and creating patient partnerships.","174":"Over the course of the last two decades, much progress has been made in the approaches to the care of people with mental health and addiction challenges. Yet there is still more work to do in terms of advocacy and the provision of meaningful and effective support for these individuals.","175":"In the province of Ontario, many of the public health units (PHUs) now possess and use social media as part of their daily health promotion and communication operations. To explore this topic, a planning meeting was held to generate deeper insights toward the use of these forms of technology for preventative services delivery. The planning meeting was held with 50 participants, comprising representatives from 20 of the 36 PHUs in Ontario, interested academics, students and government representatives. A nominal group technique (NGT) was used to build consensus related to future research needs, as related to public health and social media. Participants generated a range of insights around the use of social media, including the need for: leadership buy-in and resource allocation; social media policy and governance structure; performance measurement and evaluation; practices related to engagement with program recipients and addressing the lack of resources faced by many health units. Future research priorities were also generated, related to evaluating the cost-benefit of social media activities and understanding behaviour change implications. Further research is needed to evaluate the functionality, leadership and competency requirements and impact(s) of these new forms of health communication technology within public health service delivery.","176":"The Special Focus on Advanced Practice Nursing in Canada, published in the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership (http:\/\/www.longwoods.com\/publications\/nursing-leadership\/24885), highlights the unique contributions that advanced practice nurses (APNs) have added to meet the demands of the evolving Canadian healthcare system. Drs. Martin-Misener and Bryant-Lukosius should be commended for their vision as editors of this Special Issue of CJNL, and profiling some excellent work that has occurred across the country in this field of research. In light of this Special Issue, this commentary is written to offer some reflections upon how APNs (i.e., nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists) have influenced the nursing profession more broadly within the Canadian context.","177":"As a prime example of the value of an interprofessional approach to care advocated by Orchard and colleagues earlier in this issue (Orchard 2017a, 2017b), the following case study profiles one highly effective interprofessional New Brunswick-based team which cares for clients and families in their homes; a model which has been functional and extremely successful for more than three decades and remains unparalleled in Canada.","178":"There are promising signs that interprofessional collaborative practice is associated with quality care transitions and improved access to patient-centred healthcare. A one-day symposium was held to increase awareness and capacity to deliver quality collaborative care transitions to interprofessional health disciplines and service users. A mixed methods study was used that included a pre-post survey design and interviews to examine the impact of the symposium on knowledge, attitudes and practice change towards care transitions and collaborative practice with symposium participants. Our survey results revealed a statistically significant increase in only a few of the scores towards care transitions and collaborative practice among post-survey respondents. Three key themes emerged from the qualitative analysis, including: (1) engaging the patient at the heart of interprofessional collaboration and co-design of care transitions; (2) having time to reach out, share and learn from each other; and (3) reflecting, reinforcing and revising practice. Further efforts that engage inter-organizational learning by exchanging knowledge and evaluating these forums are warranted. ","179":"This paper presents a discussion on the key role that nurses assume with their patients and also with other health providers. We will argue that a change is needed to provide \"space\" for nurses to re-engage with their patients and to return to their key coordinating role between their patients, their family members and other health providers in interprofessional patient and family-centred collaborative practice. Furthermore, we will discuss the important role of nurse leaders to present the nurses' unique role and importance to health system administrators and policy makers to improve health outcomes of patients and how their role can concomitantly reduce healthcare costs.","180":"The purpose of this paper is to present a perspective advocating for a dual role of nurse leaders as both managers and advocates for nurses to demonstrate their disciplinary knowledge and practice. Further, the paper will demonstrate that nurse leaders have the capacity to influence integration of interprofessional collaborative practice with other health professionals within their leadership areas. Additionally, we present strategies to advocate for changing the meaning of nursing leadership in practice, and creating a shift from task orientation of nurses' care to one that is individualized and comprehensive. Finally, a plea will be made to return the coordinating role of the nurse to its rightful place within patient care.","181":"Editor-in-Chief, Lynn Nagle, recently talked to the new CEO of the Canadian Nurses Association, Michael Villeneuve about his leadership plans and goals.","182":"The editor-in-chief asks: with strong evidence in favour of collaborative practice, why has it not yet been adopted across the system? What is holding it back?","183":"This paper focuses on the central role of senior nurse leaders in advancing organizational resources and support for communication between healthcare providers and carers that influences patient and carer outcomes during the transition from hospital to the community. A Think Tank (Lobchuk 2012) funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) gathered interdisciplinary and intersectoral stakeholders from local, national and international levels to develop a Family Carer Communication Research Collaboration. Workshop stakeholders addressed critical challenges in meeting communication needs of carers as partners with clinicians in promoting safe care for the elderly, chronically or seriously ill or disabled individuals in the community. Key priority areas identified the need to uncover nurse leader perspectives at the system, nurse leader, healthcare provider and patient levels where communication with carers occurs. The overarching outcome from the workshop focuses on the need for nurse leaders to advocate for patients and their families in meeting carer communication needs. The authors' \"call to action\" requires commitment and investment from nurse leaders in the critical juncture of healthcare delivery to strengthen communication between healthcare providers and carers that influence patient and carer outcomes in seamless transitions of care.","184":"Calls for transformational change of our healthcare system are increasingly clear, persuasive and insistent. They resonate at all levels, with those who fund, deliver, provide and receive care, and they are rooted in a deep understanding that the system, as currently rigidly structured, most often lacks the necessary flexibility to comprehensively meet the needs of patients across the continuum of care. The St. Joseph's Health System (SJHS) Integrated Comprehensive Care (ICC) Program, which bundles care and funding across the hospital to home continuum, has reduced fragmentation of care, and it has delivered improved outcomes for patients, providers and the system. This case study explores the essential contribution of nursing leadership to this successful transformation of healthcare service delivery.","185":"Our country's recent negotiations for a new Health Accord have shone light on the importance of more accessible and better home care. The direction being taken on health funding investments has sent a strong message about healthcare system redesign. It is time to design a healthcare system that moves us away from a hospital-focused model to one that is more effective, integrated and sustainable and one that places a greater emphasis on primary care, community care and home care. The authors of the lead paper (Sharkey and Lefebre 2017) provide their vision for people-powered care and explore the opportunity for nursing leaders to draw upon the unique expertise and insights of home care nursing as a strategic lever to bring about real health system transformation across all settings. Understanding what really matters at the beginning of the healthcare journey and honouring the tenants of partnership and empowerment as a universal starting point to optimize health outcomes along the continuum of care present a very important opportunity. However, as nursing leaders in the health system change, it is important that we extend the conversation beyond one setting. It is essential that as leaders, we seek to design models of care delivery that achieve a shared vision, focused on seamless coordinated care across the continuum that is person-centred. Bringing about real system change requires us to think differently and consider the role of nursing across all settings, collaboratively co-designing so that our collective skills and knowledge can work within a complementary framework. Focusing our leadership efforts on enhancing integration across healthcare settings will ensure that nurses can be important leaders and active decision-makers in health system change. A shared vision for healthcare requires all of us to look beyond the usual practices and structures, hospitals and institutional walls.","186":"In this commentary, Thorne and Stajduhar respond to Sharkey and Lefebre's (2017) thoughts on Bringing Nursing Back to the Future Through People-Powered Care by reflecting on the kinds of structural and ideological conditions that have dismantled the traditional root structure by which the nursing profession nurtured its members and optimized their inherent capacity as champions of placing patients at the centre of care. Although the idea of patient-centred care has great popular appeal in the current context, embedding it meaningfully into a transformed healthcare system will require dedicated attention to addressing the attitudes, discourses and leadership mechanisms within which strong systems of nursing can flourish and thrive.","187":"At a time when there is a growing interest in person- and family-centred care and integrated community-based models, the unique strengths and expertise of home care nursing is a strategic lever for change across all healthcare settings. In this paper, we explore the theme of people-powered care as a universal starting point - a new approach to health and wellness that is anchored in the strengths of people, their networks and the patterns of everyday life. Leveraging key insights from home and community care, along with broader societal shifts towards personalization and empowerment, we discuss how nurses in all areas of the system can lead the way by empowering staff, patients and their families. Finally, we look at the implications for nursing leadership including how our knowledge, skills and abilities must continue to evolve to effectively impact change and enable this vital transformation to occur.","188":"There is agreement across all provinces that there is transformation needed in the area of home and community care. Yet, where is the collective voice of nurse leaders in this transformation? The guest editor calls on nurses to respond to this unique opportunity to shape the transformation of our health system, and improve care for patients and their caregivers.","189":"The editor-in-chief extends thanks to all contributors to this special focus on nursing leadership in home and community care. Thank you for leadership, thoughtful reflections and call to action. The possibilities for a different \"person-centered\", \"people-powered\" home and community-oriented health system can be realized with nursing at the helm.","190":"The addition of nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary healthcare (PHC) is intended to improve accessibility. This study compared access to NP services in consultative, dyad and multiprofessional team structures in Nova Scotia. Accessibility indicators included NP appointment wait times, after-hours coverage and acceptance of new patients. Secondary analysis of province-wide survey data from PHC providers showed multiprofessional structures had shorter median NP appointment wait times: 0.5 days for urgent appointments versus 6.5 days (dyad, p= 0.004) and 4.5 days (consultative, p= 0.003), 4 days for non-urgent appointments versus 15 days (dyad, p= 0.020) and 4.5 days (consultative, p&gt; 0.05). Only NPs in the multiprofessional structure provided after-hours coverage and over half the NPs in each structure were accepting new patients. These results support the use of team-based care and should be considered along with local needs and resources when planning team structures.","191":"Hospitals require identification of the most responsible provider (MRP) for care of admitted patients. Traditionally, the MRP has been a physician. However, legislation changes within Ontario authorize the nurse practitioner (NP) to admit and provide care for hospital in-patients. There is little evidence illustrating adoption of the NP-as-MRP model in Ontario. Reasons for a delayed adoption of this innovative model of care are unclear and warrant investigation. One hospital implemented the NP-as-MRP as an appropriate and beneficial model to maximize access to care for senior patients. Rogers' (2003) model of diffusion of innovation provides a framework to describe the processes undertaken that led to their adoption of the NP-as-MRP model. Detailed processes are highlighted for hospital leaders, hospital board members, and NPs. Other sites are encouraged to evaluate whether the NP-as-MRP model will be appropriate for specific populations; each site should undertake a process that is as detailed to ensure thorough preparation of all who will be affected by this change. Evaluation of the outcomes of the NP-as-MRP model is necessary and must be population- and institution-specific, as these provide new evidence in the early stages of this recent NP-related innovation in Ontario.","192":"In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that the number of people living with dementia worldwide was approximately 35.6 million; they projected a doubling of this number by 2030, and tripling by 2050. Although the majority of people living with a dementia live in the community, residential facility care by nursing providers is a common part of the dementia journey in most countries. Previously published research confirms that caring for people living with dementia in such facilities often creates moral distress for nursing care providers. In this paper, the authors share additional findings from a two-year, two-phase, mixed methods study of moral distress as experienced by nursing caregivers of residents with dementia in residential care settings in a Western Canadian province. The findings relate to strategies to reduce moral distress in this caregiving group, with a particular focus on the role of supportive and responsive leadership. Important implications for practice and for leadership in the residential care sector are presented.","193":"Presently only about 9% of seniors over the age of 75 live in residential care facilities but the anticipated exponential growth of the senior population will put increasing pressure on the need for supportive, continuing care services in the years ahead (CIHI 2017a). They are on average 86 years of age with a diagnosis of dementia (67%) and some cognitive and\/or functional impairment (98%) (CIHI 2017b). These compromised seniors are also more likely to use hospital services than others, and in many jurisdictions occupy acute care beds for extended periods because ongoing management of their complex conditions is often not possible within long-term care (LTC) homes. In addition, unnecessary and futile care at the end of life often leads to suffering for individuals and their families (Dobbins 2016), which might otherwise be avoided with the presence of institutionally based providers such as nurse practitioners (NPs). Christian and Barker (2009) identified NPs as a valuable resource to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations which often lead to complications and devastating results for seniors. Although evidence of the positive impact of NPs working in LTC facilities dates back to the 1970s, very few organizations have created and obtained funding support for these positions in LTC settings. This case study illustrates the impact of the NP role in a New Brunswick LTC facility; demonstrating the value of a model that includes an NP collaborating with physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. As shown in this case, the presence of an NP clearly impacted a reduction in emergency room visits and hospitalizations, events that more often than not accelerate further physical, mental and functional decline particularly among the frail elderly. Christian and Barker (2009) described the significant consequences of hospitalization for the elderly patient including irreversible decline in function, delirium and exposure to iatrogenic disease. Having an NP available within LTC affords the residents ongoing monitoring that allows for preemptive and proactive care. NPs providing oversight to the collaborative management of the care of LTC residents has the potential to not only realize cost-avoidance for the healthcare system but also enhance the quality of care for residents and their families.","194":"Using a cross-sectional survey of managers, we examined the role of nurse practitioners (NPs) in long-term care (LTC) facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador. We compared facilities with no regular primary care provider, with only family physicians (FPs) and with both FPs and NPs. A total of 91 of 127 (71.0%) facilities completed the survey; 19 (21.3%) facilities had no primary care provider, 42 (47.2%) had FPs only and 28 (31.5%) had both FPs and NPs. NPs and FPs provide a similar range of services in LTC. On a five-point Likert scale, facilities with no primary care provider were more likely to rate continuity of care lower (2.59; p &lt; 0.001) than either facilities with FPs (3.85) or facilities with FPs and NPs (3.78). All facilities agreed with the statement that increased availability of other health professionals (4.64) and using NPs (4.47) would improve care. NPs were perceived to reduce the need for hospital admissions and emergency room visits. There is support among LTC administrators for incorporating NPs in LTC, including among administrators whose facilities did not have an NP.","195":"Nurse practitioners (NPs) can play an important role in providing primary care to residents in long-term care (LTC) homes. However, relatively little is known about the day-to-day collaboration between NPs and physicians (MDs) in LTC, or factors that may influence this collaboration. Survey data from NPs in Canadian LTC homes were used to explore these issues. Thirty-seven of the 45 (82%) identified LTC NPs across Canada completed the survey. NPs worked with an average of 3.4 MDs, ranging from 1-26 MDs. The most common reasons for collaborating included managing acute and chronic conditions, and updating MDs on resident status changes. Satisfaction with NP-MD collaboration was high, and did not significantly differ among NPs working full versus part time, NPs working in a single versus multiple homes, or NPs with more versus less experience. By understanding the nature of NP-MD collaboration, we can identify ways of supporting and enhancing collaboration between these professionals.","196":"The recently released book Public Policy and Canadian Nursing: Lessons from the Field, by Michael J. Villeneuve, has been described as a \"must read\" by Gail Donner, professor emerita, Faculty of Nursing, University of Toronto, and by Kathleen Macmillan, professor and director of the School of Nursing at Dalhousie University. That is an excellent recommendation from two well-respected Canadian nurse leaders.","197":"Discussions of seniors with complex co-morbid conditions \"clogging up\" or \"blocking\" acute care beds have been persistent over the last two decades. In reality, many of these hospital admissions are likely avoidable with the allocation of appropriate resources to manage their care in the community. While promises of enhanced community-based care and support have been touted for years, the solutions have been inadequate, and continue to fall short of the mark. Notwithstanding the likely need for more long-term residential care beds in the face of Canada's aging demographic, it is clear that much more could be done to maintain seniors in their own homes or within residential care facilities - that is to say, out of the hospital!","198":"The use of mobile devices by nurse practitioners (NPs) to meet an evolving technological landscape is expanding rapidly. A longitudinal study of the ways NP students \"normalize\" the use of mobile devices in clinical education was completed. This study used researcher-designed survey tools, including sociodemographic questions, and the numerical picture was augmented and interpreted in light of the textual data in the form of selected interviews. Data indicate that mobile technology is normalized in the social realm but still developing in the clinical realm. Progress is hindered by non-modelling by faculty, inconsistent healthcare policy and lack of understanding of the affordances available through this technology. Overall, mobile technology is utilized and normalized in practice; this in turn has influenced their ability to prepare students for practice. Data presented can assist educators and clinicians alike in developing a more fulsome understanding on how to appropriately incorporate mobile technology into education and practice.","199":"It is estimated that the number of people who die of life-limiting illnesses in Canada will double by the year 2056. Advance care planning (ACP) is one way to improve the quality of end-of-life care. ACP is a process of ongoing discussions whereby a person communicates important values and desired outcomes at the end of life prior to healthcare crises. Nurse practitioners (NP) commonly diagnose and plan healthcare for patients who may have life-limiting conditions and thus are in a strategic position to engage patients in ACP. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the extent and nature of NP involvement in ACP. This descriptive study explored Ontario NPs' knowledge, beliefs and level of implementation of ACP. NPs employed in hospital settings were significantly more likely to engage in ACP with patients and to have a policy governing ACP initiation compared with their community-employed counterparts. There were no significant differences between the NPs in these two settings in the beliefs, attitudes or personal comfort in initiating ACP. Implications for education, practice and research are provided.","200":"In 2012, the Canadian Government revised regulations under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to allow nurse practitioners (NPs) to prescribe controlled substances. In Ontario, it remains illegal for NPs to prescribe controlled substances, as provincial law prohibits this practice. In 2013, the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) conducted an online survey of NPs to inform future development of regulations and practice standards that would promote safe, ethical and effective practice when NPs are permitted to prescribe controlled substances in Ontario. The objectives of the survey were to better understand current NP practice with clients requiring controlled substances, NP learning needs related to controlled substances and their future intent to prescribe controlled substances if the authority to do so is introduced. A total of 1,447 Ontario NPs were invited via e-mail to complete the survey. The survey sample consisted of all NPs registered with CNO with an Adult (n = 462) or a Pediatrics (n = 204) Specialty Certificate and a random sample of NPs with a Primary Healthcare Specialty Certificate (n = 781). A total of 529 NPs (37%) responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (71%) reported that they would prescribe controlled substances if they were given the legal authority. This was more prominent for NPs working in specialized practice (79%) compared with those working in generalist practice (66%). Most NPs (64%) indicated they would require additional education to gain the competence to prescribe controlled substances. The most common educational needs identified were related to pharmacotherapy, jurisprudence and the knowledge to assess and manage the unique risks associated with controlled substances, such as addiction, diversion and misuse. As NP authority to prescribe controlled substances is implemented across Canada, these survey results may help inform regulatory bodies, educators, employers and NPs in establishing mechanisms and policies to support safe, ethical and effective client care.","201":"Hospital leaders in Canada are continuously seeking new ways to meet patient needs and Ministry of Health priorities. One approach, integrating nurse practitioners (NPs) into the interprofessional team of caregivers, has demonstrated the quality outcomes hospital leaders seek. However, hospital leaders report there is limited information available to them to clearly know NP role value. This is concerning, as these leaders make the employment and integration decisions that enable role success. The lack of information for leaders has left NP role integration success to chance. Without clear strategies, there is risk that hospital NP roles will not be integrated such that optimal practice and quality outcomes can be achieved. This paper aims to provide pragmatic information for hospital leaders using a real-life example of a hospital NP role. Optimal NP practice and outcomes are described using the three major practice foci of a new evidenced-based framework specific to the hospital NP role. New strategies to support successful integration and role value optimization are provided for hospital leaders, physicians and NPs.","202":"Background: Nurse practitioners (NPs) were introduced in British Columbia (BC) in 2005 as a new category of health provider. Given the newness of NPs in our health system, it is not unexpected that continued work is required to better integrate NPs in healthcare in BC. Aim: This paper will focus on a research study using dialogic methods as a participatory knowledge translation approach to facilitate integration of NPs in primary healthcare (PHC) settings. Methods: Deliberative dialogue (DD) is a useful knowledge translation tool in health services delivery. Through facilitated conversations with stakeholders, invited to consider research evidence in the context of their experience and tacit knowledge, collective data are generated. DD is a powerful tool to engage stakeholders in the development and implementation of evidence-informed policies and services through discussion of issues, consideration of priorities and development of concrete actions that can be implemented by policy makers and decision-makers. Two DD sessions were held with stakeholders involved in supporting NP integration in a health authority in southern interior BC. Stakeholders were provided syntheses of a literature review and interview results. The first session resulted in the collective development of 10 actions to promote NP integration in PHC settings. The second session was conducted six months later to discuss progress and revisions to actions. Discussion: The use of the dialogic methods used in studying NP integration in PHC settings proved useful in promoting real conversation about the implications of research evidence in living contexts, enabling diverse stakeholders to co-create collaborative actions for further NP integration. The conversations and actions were used to support further NP integration during the study and beyond. Conclusion: DD is a useful approach for transforming health services policy and delivery. It has the potential to move change forward with co-created solutions by the stakeholders involved.","203":"The study aim was to determine benefits and challenges of a community initiative to introduce the nurse practitioner (NP) role in rural primary care. We used a mixed-methods, participatory action research design. Data collection included surveys, interviews, patient record data and shadow billing data. Patient, physician and healthcare professional (HCP) surveys were followed by interviews of survey participants and key local informants. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey and patient record data, and content analysis was used to analyze interview data. Benefits, challenges and recommendations were the result of mixed-methods synthesis. Forty-one patients, one HCP and four physicians returned surveys, with 14 patients, one HCP, two local leaders and the NP participating in interviews. The NP provided primary care to 10% of clinic patients in a flexible service delivery model. A high proportion of patients had chronic health concerns. Patient outcomes were generally positive, and patients expressed satisfaction with care. Being connected to the community was important to role implementation. Benefits included increased access to cost-effective, quality primary care. Challenges were funding, limited role understanding and potential for role isolation. Recommendations highlight the need for local community buy-in and provincial support in sustaining the innovation.","204":"Nurse practitioners (NPs) are being encouraged to practice to the full extent of their skills, and they have a critical role to play in leading health system reform. The evidence in support of NP-led initiatives is growing; however, in spite of the positive outcomes associated with these initiatives, considerable opposition to and debate about the potential for NPs to lead health system change and interprofessional teams continues. To date, we know very little about NP leadership activities, particularly those activities that contribute to primary care system change, and there are very few examples of this type of leadership. The qualitative descriptive study here was part of a larger case study that examined stakeholder participation in a system change led by NPs. The change involved the introduction of a new NP-led model of team-based primary care delivery in Ontario, Canada. Data from participant interviews and public documents were analyzed to describe the activities and attributes (perseverance, risk-taking and effective communication) of two NP leaders who were the drivers of this change. Knowledge of these activities and attributes has the potential to inform NP leadership roles in health system policy planning and implementation. However, to be able to provide effective leadership in system change, NPs need access to educational content about public policy and opportunities to develop and practice the skills required to work with multiple stakeholders, including those who oppose change.","205":"The previous 16 years have seen a number of healthcare reforms meant to increase access to primary healthcare services in Ontario. This included the establishment of an innovative model, the nurse practitioner-led clinics (NPLCs). NPLCs held promise for nurse practitioners (NPs) to practice to their full potential and optimize patient care. A multiple-case study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of care for patients with diabetes and multimorbidity at NPLCs. Five NPLCs, all in underserved areas in the mid-northern region of the province, were part of the study. Data collection included a chart audit, NP interviews and review of organizational information. Multiple-case analysis was conducted and four interrelated themes emerged about the quality of care of patients with diabetes and multimorbidity at the NPLCs. It was confirmed that the NP is the primary care provider at NPLCs. Healthcare policy such as a lack of increase in NP salary for 10 years has contributed to poor NP recruitment and retention. Insufficient healthcare resources in the communities where NPLCs are located and high patient vulnerability have a negative influence on the quality of care. Strategies, including mentoring, offer possible solutions to improve the quality of care at NPLCs.","206":"The impact of substance use disorders on the Canadian healthcare system is large, contributing to high use of hospital resources. At the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada's largest mental health and addictions academic teaching hospital, substance use disorders constitute the primary diagnosis of 31% of annual inpatient admissions. Clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) with expertise in addictions are ideally prepared to promote competency development among baccalaureate-prepared nurses who are caring for this population. Despite recent advocacy to advance the addictions nursing workforce in Canada, recruitment of graduate-level CNSs in this field remains a challenge owing to a shortage of candidates with addictions expertise. Healthcare organizations specializing in substance use treatment must use innovative professional development strategies to foster nursing leadership that addresses the complex needs of this clinical population. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an innovative competency-based professional development framework designed to build capacity of CNSs at CAMH.","207":"The Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) is pleased to provide this update on the integration of the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) role in Canada. Many advances have occurred since the publication of the Canadian Journal of Nursing Leadership special issue focused on advanced practice nursing (APN) in 2010. The CNA continues to promote and advance this APN role, and views the CNS as an essential and critical role for better care to Canadians.","208":"The optimization of the health workforce is perhaps one of the most critical actions that health reform initiatives need to address moving forward. The optimization of advanced practice nursing roles is no exception. In general, scopes of practice tend to be organized on the basis of tradition and politics rather than how best they can meet shifting population health needs. Health workforce optimization is now both the language adopted internationally and a key area of focus for health reform.","209":"This 2016 special edition on advanced practice nursing (APN) roles in Canada builds on earlier role progress reported in the first special edition in 2010. Advancements in role development and innovative models that utilize APN roles are highlighted. The need for further efforts to support health systems integration of APN roles related to funding, research and decision-maker understanding of the roles, and to learn from international experience in APN role implementation are described.","210":"","211":"Members of a nursing research cluster realized that they needed to determine whether, given their diverse philosophies, they could formulate a collective research agenda responding to an administrative recommendation. The cluster's leaders conducted an appraisal of the role and importance of trust as an element for promoting collaboration in a nursing research cluster and for building a collective social identity. The Social Exchange Theory framed the appraisal. A survey and a facilitation session about trust in research partnerships were conducted with eight female nursing researchers\/faculty. Facilitation day's discussion was fully audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and the content coded using ATLAS.ti 6. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the qualitative aspects of the recorded discussion and the survey questionnaire explanatory responses. Responses to survey closed-questions were compiled as descriptive statistics. Participants revealed that mutual support, valuing each other and working collaboratively facilitated trust in intellectual partnership. Hindering factors were an environment suppressing expression of ideas and views, lack of open dialogue and decision-making among team members and lack of a sense of belonging. This paper has the potential to contribute to the knowledge of nursing leaders who are intending to develop and sustain nursing research teams in both academic and non-academic organizations. The paper will be especially useful as they deal with issues of trust in intellectual partnership in diverse settings. ","212":"To describe how organizational context and restructuring influenced nurse leaders' use of evidence in decision-making in their management practice. Qualitative descriptive study. Fifteen leaders at executive and front-line manager levels in one organization were interviewed using a semi-structured format. Inductive content analysis generated five main themes: leaders strove to keep relationships that preserve best decision-making ability; and sought the best knowledge to inform their decisions. However, a context of constant change; more scope; less autonomy; and decisional inertia in a sea of change had profound effects on their ability to employ evidence in decision-making. Evidence-informed decision-making is a dynamic social process highly influenced by political instability in work environments. Organizational restructuring creates threats to common decision-making strategies, including information flow, relationships and priority setting. Healthcare restructuring is now a global constant, and there is a need for hospital leaders to understand and mitigate the effect restructuring has on the ability of leaders to engage in evidence-informed decision-making. Strategies are proposed to manage uncertainty and support nurse leaders in their evidence-informed decision-making to deliver quality health services. This research provides an in-depth examination of how evidence-informed decision-making is influenced in the context of instability and uncertainty due to ever-present organizational restructuring. ","213":"The aim of this paper is to explore the role and activities of nurse practitioners (NPs) working in long-term care (LTC) to understand concepts of access to primary care for residents. Utilizing the \"FIT\" framework developed by Penchanksy and Thomas, we used a directed content analysis method to analyze data from a pan-Canadian study of NPs in LTC. Individual and focus group interviews were conducted at four sites in western, central and eastern regions of Canada with 143 participants, including NPs, RNs, regulated and unregulated nursing staff, allied health professionals, physicians, administrators and directors and residents and family members. Participants emphasized how the availability and accessibility of the NP had an impact on access to primary and urgent care for residents. Understanding more about how NPs affect access in Canadian LTC will be valuable for nursing practice and healthcare planning and policy and may assist other countries in planning for the introduction of NPs in LTC settings to increase access to primary care.

The aim was to better understand the perceived influence of the Institute over time on professional lives and careers of alumni and identify the critical design features that supported leadership development. Nurses and other health disciplines from all levels of leadership and from most provinces completed an online survey (n = 165) and a subset was interviewed (n = 33). The majority of alumni (50-68%) rated the impact of the Institute as significant or very significant on seven of the eight selected intended leadership outcomes. For 73-78% of the alumni, the Institute had a recurring or profound positive impact on their professional lives as leaders and personal careers. Alumni who reported the greatest impact of the program on their knowledge, skills and confidence as leaders also had higher levels of career satisfaction and work engagement. Design elements that impacted their development included the theoretical and conceptual content, interactive and experiential structure and mentoring. Recommendations for organizational sponsors included the need for opportunities to apply learning, ongoing coaching, mentoring and career counseling specific to their leadership career path.

By creating reliable and resilient healthcare organizations that enhance nurses' capacity to engage in relational care and vigilance, healthcare agencies can effectively achieve safety and quality aims. Integral to this is the nurse-patient relationship, whereby nurses know patient preferences for care and recognize when patients are deteriorating to prevent harm within the context of care environments. ","223":"The omission of oral care is linked to increased nurse workload and may contribute to serious patient infection and growing healthcare costs. Therefore, ineffective oral care comprises a significant patient safety issue across healthcare settings internationally. As studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between Nurs Leadersh (Tor Ont) and improved patient outcomes, it is imperative that leaders seek effective approaches to facilitate contextual exploration of barriers and facilitators for resolution of oral care delivery problems. One approach to improved processes of oral care is the creative engagement of front-line clinicians in the problems they confront in everyday practice. By drawing upon the role and process of facilitation, we outline two projects, located in Australia and Canada, that engaged front-line nurses, health leaders, and researchers as partners to identify a path to improved oral care delivery. In this paper, we summarize key learnings for nursing leaders about strategies to facilitate delivery of fundamental oral care. We found that facilitation, contextual knowledge and academic-clinician partnerships were essential to the detection and evaluation of oral care delivery problems and the identification of priorities for practice improvement. As collaboration is imperative for sustainable innovation, we summarize strategies of effective leadership for improving oral care delivery.

Without being aware of it, educators and practicing nurses may be teaching nursing students that fundamental nursing care is unimportant, uncomplicated and not really nursing's responsibility. This paper explores the concept of the \"hidden curriculum\" in nursing education, as it relates to fundamental nursing care and calls for greater partnerships between education and service to uncover the hidden curriculum; to effectively shape it to achieve alignment between classroom and practice; and, ultimately, to improve care processes and patient outcomes through collaboration. A renewed focus on the vital importance of what is considered \"basics\" to patient outcomes is required in nursing education. ","225":"In the current healthcare environment, cost control is an ongoing concern of public and private payers and of healthcare administrators. For nursing leaders in this environment, a critical task is establishing nursing as a service line and communicating its value to the organization. The work of nurses needs to be better articulated and models such as the Fundamentals of Care Framework can assist in this. Also critical is presenting what is lost for patients and the hospital through missed care and its consequences when nurse staffing is inadequate. Economic analysis has found that when the cost savings from lower length of stay, reduced adverse outcomes, reduced admissions and other benefits of adequate staffing are taken into account, adequate staffing is affordable. ","226":"The fundamentals of care have re-emerged as an important consideration in nursing following a period when these role elements were predominantly \"delegated tasks\" delivered by other (usually unregistered\/unregulated) members of the health and social care team. Contemporary critiques of nursing highlight the technical focus of nursing at the expense of its caring function. Person-centred nursing theory offers a way of reinstating the value of fundamental care as a core part of providing holistic nursing to persons as well as highlighting the importance of the nursing role in coordinating healthcare services in ways that are consistent with a person's beliefs and values. This paper argues that a focus on person-centredness enables the core function of nurses as providers and coordinators of holistic person-centred fundamental care to be revalued. It highlights the importance of nurses being clear about \"what matters\" in caring practices and suggests that nurses adopting a person-centred approach can achieve effective care coordination through the lens of the fundamentals of care. In reading this paper, a greater understanding of person-centredness in the context of the fundamentals of care can be achieved. ","227":"This paper makes the case for revisiting our understanding and valuing of basic or fundamental nursing care. Despite the interest in movements such as the person-centred or patient-centred care agenda, there continues to be concern about patient safety, quality of experience and getting the simple things right. Part of this debate is around whether meeting patients' fundamental care needs (such as personal hygiene, elimination and eating and drinking) within acute care settings constitutes legitimate nursing responsibilities or whether these needs ought to become part of \"hotel services\" executed by care assistants with elementary training or, as in many lower-income health systems, undertaken by relatives.

Namely, the nursing informatics specialty currently faces a range of important decisions related to its knowledge base, established values and future directions - all of which are in need of development and future-proofing. In light of the increased use of automation, artificial intelligence and big data in healthcare, the specialty must also reconceptualize the roles of both nurses and informaticians to ensure that the nursing profession is ready to operate within future digitalized healthcare ecosystems. To explore these goals, the author of this manuscript outlines an examination of technological advancements currently taking place within healthcare, and also proposes implications for the nursing role and the nursing informatics specialty. Finally, recommendations and insights towards how the roles of nurses and informaticians might evolve or be shaped in the growing post-nursing informatics era are presented.

","232":"","233":"Despite a global commitment to the adoption of technologies, such as electronic health records (EHRs), to support the delivery of health services, there is little empirical guidance to support effective planning for the integration of these tools into practice settings (Suter et al. 2009). In particular, although EHR learning is known to positively influence integration (Byrne 2012), individual perspectives are often overlooked because of investigative designs that devalue such viewpoints by exploring the utility of technologies rather than the lived experiences of individual users of the technology. Therefore, this qualitative study offered nurse participants opportunities to make sense of EHR learning through talking about their experiences. This narrative inquiry was a collaborative interpretive method of discovery: stories and thematic analysis were the two separate yet complementary frames used to support data analysis. Finally, several practice implications and recommendations about EHR learning are presented with an emphasis placed upon patient safety as a way to impart accountability on behalf of learners, educators and those charged with governing responsibilities during times of EHR integration.

This article examines how the Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care (C-HOBIC) dataset can support clinical decision-making and facilitate improved sharing of information as patients transition between sectors of the healthcare system. If the benefits of electronic health records are to be fully realized, it is vital that information is collected in a standardized format to support point-of-care clinicians in decision-making, as well as for health system use. ","236":"Informatics competency adoption is a recognized issue across nursing roles in digital health practice settings. Further, it has been suggested that the health system's inability to reap the promised benefits of electronic health\/patient records is, in part, a manifestation of inadequate development of informatics competency by chief nurse executives (CNEs) and other clinicians (Amendola 2008; Simpson 2013). This paper will focus on CNE informatics competency and nursing knowledge development as it pertains to the Big Data revolution. With the paper's aim of showing how CNEs armed with informatics competency can harness the full potential of Big Data offering new opportunities for nursing knowledge development in their clinical transformation roles as eHealth project sponsors. It is proposed that informatics-savvy CNEs are the new transformational leaders of the digital age who will have the advantage to successfully advocate for nurses in leading 21st-century health systems. Also, transformational CNEs armed with informatics competency will position nurses and the nursing profession to achieve its future vision, where nurses are perceived by patients and professionals alike as knowledge workers, providing the leadership essential for safe, quality care and demonstrating nursing's unique contributions to fiscal health through clinically relevant, evidence-based practices (McBride 2005b). ","237":"Nursing informatics (NI), as a specialty of nursing, can trace its origins back as far as the 1960s. While difficult to find empirical evidence to pinpoint exactly when NI moved from the fringes of nursing to more mainstream recognition, the late 1990s to early 2000s was a period of significant growth in the desire to leverage information technology as a means of collecting more robust and reliable healthcare information. This, in turn, has led to a significant increase in the number of nurses working as NI specialists. Those who have remained in NI roles since this time are now reaching the \"mid-career\" point. This paper will examine the current NI landscape and the experience of a number of early and mid-career nurses who chose to focus on NI by exploring how and why they chose this career path, the opportunities and challenges they have faced to date and their predictions for the future of NI.

However, monitoring nursing-sensitive indicators (NSI) is a challenge. Prevalence surveys are one method used by some organizations to monitor NSI, which are patient outcomes that are directly affected by the quantity or quality of nursing care that the patient receives. The aim of this paper is to describe the development of an innovative electronic data collection tool to monitor NSI. In the preliminary development work, we designed a mobile computing application with pre-populated patient census information to collect the nursing quality data. In subsequent phases, we refined this process by designing an electronic trigger using The Ottawa Hospital's Patient Safety Learning System, which automatically generated a case report form for each inpatient based on the hospital's daily patient census on the day of the prevalence survey. Both of these electronic data collection tools were accessible on tablet computers, which substantially reduced data collection, analysis and reporting time compared to previous paper-based methods. The electronic trigger provided improved completeness of the data. This work leveraged the use of tablet computers combined with a web-based application for patient data collection at point of care. Overall, the electronic methods improved data completeness and timeliness compared to traditional paper-based methods. This initiative has resulted in the ability to collect and report on NSI organization-wide to advance decision-making support and identify quality improvement opportunities within the organization. ","240":"The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) working in alternative or complementary roles in inpatient settings. Those in alternative roles substitute for another provider and deliver similar services. Those in complementary roles deliver additional services to meet patient health needs. We searched 10 electronic databases, reference lists, pertinent journals and websites from 1980 to July 2012 with no language, publication or geographical restrictions. Study identification and assessment were completed independently by two-member teams. Internal validity was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The quality of the economic analysis was evaluated using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess outcome-specific quality of evidence. Three dated trials evaluated CNS and NP inpatient roles; they were conducted in North America and included 488 adults and 821 neonates. In one study, CNSs in complementary provider roles, when compared with usual care, were equally effective with equal resource use (very low-quality evidence). In two studies, NPs in alternative roles, when compared with physicians, were equally effective with equal-to-more resource use and equal costs (low- to moderate-quality evidence). The quality of the economic analyses was poor. Only three dated studies were identified. More research is needed to determine cost-effectiveness and inform policies and decisions related to the implementation of CNSs and NPs working exclusively in inpatient roles.

Engaged employees give an extra measure of effort to contribute to organization goals, whereas disengaged employees withdraw, have lower performance and are more likely to leave their jobs. The aim of this ethnographic study was, in part, to explore the reasons why high-calibre nurses became disengaged from their work and opted to leave their hospital-based employment in favour of independent practice, as well as to consider the organizational conditions that influenced their desire to leave. The findings revealed that nurses left their hospital-based jobs because of health system change, job characteristics, working conditions and lack of respect, which relate closely to the antecedents of employee engagement. Employee engagement can be fostered through organizational support, trust-building management behaviour and transformational leadership.","243":"Working overtime, absenteeism and agency use can negatively impact working environments, the health of staff and patient outcomes, and increase healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to explore how healthcare leaders in Ontario hospitals implement and sustain best practices that advance workforce stability within their organization. Qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. Participants included 23 healthcare leaders from 16 hospital sites. Two main themes emerged: (1) enacting proactive human resource practices and (2) having strong, caring and strategic leaders that create learning and supportive work environments. A number of sub-themes identified were reported through narratives stratified according to size (small\/large) and performance (low\/high) of each site. Insights gained from this study may offer healthcare leaders strategies to maximize the nursing workforce and minimize overtime, absenteeism and agency use to ensure safe, efficient and quality healthcare.

Leadership strategies that create empowering working conditions are likely to retain nurses who are eligible to retire, and attract future nurses to the profession. Several studies have focused on leader behaviours and structural empowerment in recent years and how these impact the work environment and staff engagement. Correlations among leader empowering behaviours, structural empowerment and work engagement have been demonstrated (Laschinger et al. 1999; Peachey 2002); however, there is a gap in the empirical literature as to how leader empowering behaviours influence nurses' work engagement by creating structurally empowering work environments. Kanter's (1977, 1993) structural empowerment theory was used to test this proposition using data from a cross-sectional study of 322 Ontario staff nurses. Mediation analysis revealed that structural empowerment partially mediated the influence of leader empowering behaviours on work engagement. The implications for healthcare managers and leaders are discussed with a view to the recruitment and retention of nursing staff, by fostering greater work engagement.

It is unknown how nurses in PC settings have responded to this practice change. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to examine registered nurses' (RNs) perspectives of the strengths, gaps, barriers and opportunities for optimizing nursing roles in the delivery of CSC within PC settings. Participants completed a demographical questionnaire and semi-structured, in-depth telephone interview. Data collection and analysis were conducted concurrently. Data were analyzed using content analysis approaches. The sample included 18 RNs working in diverse PC settings across Ontario. Participants' involvement in CSC was limited, but it could be categorized into the following three themes: care coordination and system navigation, emotional support and facilitating access to community resources. Individual, practice setting and PC team factors influenced nurses' involvement in CSC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Canadian study to examine RN roles in PC settings related to CSC. There is wide variability and opportunity to enhance RNs' roles and involvement in CSC.","249":"Healthcare organizations have been challenged to create a just culture as part of their culture of safety.

Throughout the campaign and in the post-election period, the nursing organizations presented an outward-looking view to improve health and healthcare for Canadians. We observed ways in which they adopted a nursing lens on the issues by showcasing background research, by drawing on relevant nursing knowledge and by communicating clear policy messages based on nursing expertise. The organizations and their members were effective in using social media as a primary tool for reaching out to the candidates, the public and the opinion leaders. The increasing engagement of nursing students in political action is noted as a promising sign for the future impact of the profession. Although the nursing presence was visible in this election, healthcare did not become a strong issue for the public and the political parties. We include a section on post-election uptake of issues raised during the campaign. We conclude with a call for a policy research agenda that deepens our knowledge of political advocacy with a view to identifying how patterns of engagement are defining nursing's collective influence and contributions to health equity.","251":"","252":"","253":"","254":"There is an integral connection between leadership, mentoring and professional career progression within the nursing profession.

Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) nurses practice within a unique domain both domestically and abroad. The military environment incorporates many aspects of mentoring that could benefit significantly by distance interchange. Supported through examining literature within nursing, CAF publications and other professions along with contrasting successful distance mentoring programs, the findings suggest that a top-down, leadership-driven formal mentoring program could be beneficial to CAF nurses. The literature review outlines definitions of terms for mentorship and distance mentoring or e-mentoring. A cross section of technology is now embedded in all work environments with personal communication devices commonplace. Establishing mentoring relationships from afar is practical and feasible.

In total, 18% of Canadians live in rural locations but by proportion have fewer healthcare providers compared with urban settings. Relying on a recently completed documentary analysis of published reports and grey literature on rural and remote nursing practice from Canada and around the world, we recognize that recruitment and retention will be a recurring issue. However, a variety of programs and initiatives have been developed to address this age-old problem. A discussion is provided about educational opportunities, financial incentives and enhanced infrastructure that have been developed to address recruitment and retention challenges. Ongoing evaluations of each of these areas are necessary but require cooperation across provincial and national settings.

The purpose of this study was to determine the perceived level of nursing teamwork by registered nurses, registered practical nurses, personal support workers and unit clerks working on patient care teams in one acute care hospital in northern Ontario, Canada, and to determine if a relationship exists between the staff scores on the Nursing Teamwork Survey (NTS) and participant perception of adequate staffing. Using a descriptive cross-sectional research design, 600 staff members were invited to complete the NTS and a 33% response rate was achieved (N=200). The participants from the critical care unit reported the highest scores on the NTS, whereas participants from the inpatient surgical (IPS) unit reported the lowest scores. Participants from the IPS unit also reported having less experience, being younger, having less satisfaction in their current position and having a higher intention to leave. A high rate of intention to leave in the next year was found among all participants. No statistically significant correlation was found between overall scores on the NTS and the perception of adequate staffing. Strategies to increase teamwork, such as staff education, among patient care teams may positively influence job satisfaction and patient care on patient care units.

The program represents a model of collaboration between a health region and a university, which is intended to build organizational research capacity while simultaneously facilitating quality in hospital care for seniors. We explain the program and provide implementation details with examples to illustrate how the program builds organizational research capacity at the point-of-care, where healthcare is delivered by professionals, and received by patients admitted to a hospital.

The need to improve the patient and family experience, establish and streamline professional practice standards, strengthen interprofessional collaborations, increase efficiency, create a critical mass of experts in the clinical domain of care transitions and program access, and evaluate customer experience were the organizational drivers for this transformation. The new framework identifies clients' needs and assigns a priority code. It also identifies which family member provides what support to the client and offers a one-stop service number staffed by individuals trained to provide client- and family-centred homecare services. This transformation of home healthcare transitions has improved the client and family experience, strengthened service provider satisfaction and generated efficiencies in prioritizing and delivering community healthcare services.

Public health nurses (PHNs) are in a unique position to utilize leadership and advocacy to increase the overall health and well-being of their clients. Domestic violence (DV) is a serious and widespread public health issue and PHNs have a crucial role in providing a preventative and coordinated approach to identifying and responding to DV. This article describes the process through which a group of front line PHNs took an active role in leading the development and implementation of a pilot project to address DV within their practice area. Through the development of a working group, a foundation for guidance was established to reinforce the role of the PHNs in advocating for the need to shift the focus of DV interventions from a reactive to a proactive approach.

While compassion has historically been viewed as the essence of nursing, there is concern that this has become an abstract ideal, rather than a true reflection of nursing practice. This paper describes a compassionate care initiative undertaken by the CRNNS and the initial outcomes of these educational workshops. This work is informed by an exploration of the multiplicity of factors that have brought this issue to the fore for nursing regulators, educators, administrators, the public as well as front-line staff. The two most significant areas of learning reported by workshop participants included understanding the connection between mindfulness, non-judgmental care and compassion\/self-compassion and recognizing possibilities for action related to compassionate care, even in the face of personal and environmental constraints. Implications for nursing regulators and leaders include consideration of their roles and responsibilities in supporting nurses to meet professional practice standards, such as provision of compassionate care.

The authors describe and compare the characteristics of federal, provincial and territorial financial recruitment incentive programs for registered nurses (RNs), nurse practitioners (NPs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), registered practical nurses or registered psychiatric nurses. The authors identified incentive programs from government, health ministry and student aid websites and by contacting program officials. Only government-funded recruitment programs providing funding beyond the normal employee wages and benefits and requiring a service commitment were included. The authors excluded programs offered by hospitals, regional or private firms, and programs that rewarded retention. All provinces and territories except QC and NB offer financial recruitment incentive programs for RNs; six provinces (BC, AB, SK, ON, QC and NL) offer programs for NPs, and NL offers a program for LPNs. Programs include student loan forgiveness, tuition forgiveness, education bursaries, signing bonuses and relocation expenses. Programs target trainees, recent graduates and new hires.

Nurse knowledge brokers can bridge the gap between research producers and those that need evidence for decision-making and support capacity development for evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM). Knowledge broker competencies include graduate-level education with exposure to research methods; experience with the EIDM process; and established networking skills to bring researchers, decision-makers, stakeholders and policymakers together. For the knowledge broker to be successful, the nurse leader can cultivate an organizational culture supportive of evidence use with advocacy for mandates that require evidence for decisions, structures in place for each stage of the EIDM process, and physical resources such as library services for evidence retrieval.

There has been little research describing the preferred knowledge transfer strategies used by different stakeholder groups, including healthcare providers, policymakers and administrators. The purpose of the survey was to gain an understanding of the content and preferred dissemination strategies of knowledge users of briefing notes about the effectiveness of advanced practice nursing (APN) roles in Canada. An on-line cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2011 to January 2012. Purposeful sampling was used to identify the target audience. The questionnaire included six items. The response rate was 44% (n=75\/170). Participants identified that the briefing note should concisely summarize definitions for APN roles and information about the safety, effectiveness, cost savings and effective role implementation strategies. Multiple approaches were favoured to disseminate the information. Preferred dissemination strategies included personalized emails, meeting with briefing note recipients, engaging nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists in organizations where APN roles have been successfully implemented, engaging the media and using social media.

A Delphi survey of nurse experts was conducted to explore perceptions about workplace interventions in terms of feasibility and likelihood of positive impact on nurse outcomes such as job satisfaction and nurse retention. The interventions that received the highest ratings for likelihood of positive impact included: bedside handover to improve communication at shift report and promote patient-centred care; training program for nurses in dealing with violent or aggressive behaviour; development of charge nurse leadership team; training program focused on creating peer-supportive atmospheres and group cohesion; and schedule that recognizes work balance and family demands. The overall findings are consistent with the literature that highlights the importance of communication and teamwork, nurse health and safety, staffing and scheduling practices, professional development and leadership and mentorship.

It was part of a larger mixed-methods study (2011) designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of new graduate nurse transition best practices, across six British Columbia health authorities. Data collection involved individual interviews with academic nurse educators (n=4) and separate focus groups with new graduate (n=48) and front-line nurse leaders (n=69). Disparity emerged as the overriding theme and described differences between stakeholder group perspectives, between expectations and reality, and within and across programs. Four disparities emerged: entry-level education and practice, perspectives on employment and career planning, transition program elements and support. Despite general satisfaction with undergraduate preparation, theory-practice gaps were identified. New Graduates experienced misalignments between their employment expectations and their realities. The employed student nurse program in which many new graduates had participated did not always yield employment, but when it did, differences in transitional expectations arose between new graduates and leaders. There was considerable variation across and within provincial new graduate programs with respect to orientation, supernumerary time and preceptorship characteristics, including lack of training. Disparities arose in the nature, amount of and access to support and the monitoring of new graduate progress. Findings reinforced organizational complexities and the importance of communication across education and practice sectors. This paper uncovers the tensions between the perspectives of new graduates and nurse leaders about transitional programs and opens the opportunity to collaborate in aligning the perspectives. ","274":"The landscape in master's-prepared nursing education has vastly changed. Programs are constantly expanding and evolving to respond to changing trends and needs in healthcare. Simultaneously, the demographic profile of nurses returning to graduate studies has immeasurably diversified. While it can be argued that developing advanced practice nurses (APNs) at an earlier time point may lengthen their leadership careers such that they build stronger portfolios to effect more substantive healthcare changes, it is also worth questioning whether limited clinical experience in our new generation of nurse leaders will ultimately widen our proverbial knowledge-practice gap. ","275":"","276":"","277":"Nurse migration is of global concern for every country, and study of migration can provide critical information for managers concerned with nurse recruitment and retention. This mixed-methods research examined factors influencing registered nurses' (RNs') decisions to work in their home country, Canada, or to commute daily to a nursing position in the United States. Measures included nurses' feelings about their work environment conditions, work status congruence (the goodness of fit between employer expectations and their own regarding hours and times worked), professional development opportunities, and their perceptions of organizational support and autonomy (freedom and independence) in the workplace. All work environment variables were significantly higher for nurses working in Michigan. Qualitative results supported these survey findings, providing additional information about nurses' satisfaction. Nurses in our sample were more satisfied with all the work environment factors examined, even when stress from commuting out of country was experienced. The environmental issues examined in this study should be considered by nurse managers concerned with recruitment and retention of nurses. ","278":"Increasing role complexity has intensified the work of managers in supporting healthcare teams. This study examined the influence of front-line managers' characteristics and scope of responsibility on teamwork. Scope of responsibility considers the breadth of the manager's role. A descriptive, correlational design was used to collect cross-sectional survey and administrative data in four acute care hospitals. A convenience sample of 754 staff completed the Relational Coordination Scale as a measure of teamwork that focuses on the quality of communication and relationships. Nurses (73.9%), allied health professionals (14.7%) and unregulated staff (11.7%) worked in 54 clinical areas, clustered under 30 front-line managers. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modelling. Leadership practices, clinical support roles and compressed operational hours had positive effects on teamwork. Numbers of non-direct report staff and areas assigned had negative effects on teamwork. Teamwork did not vary by span, managerial experience, worked hours, occupational diversity or proportion of full-time employees. Large, acute care teaching hospitals can enable managers to foster teamwork by enhancing managers' leadership practices, redesigning the flow or reporting structure for non-direct reports, optimizing managerial hours relative to operational hours, allocating clinical support roles, reducing number of areas assigned and, potentially, introducing co-manager models. ","279":"Critical reflection on the introduction to baccalaureate education as the entry-to-practice requirement in Canada is timely. Efforts to chart future directions for nursing education must take into account long-standing issues from the past. ","280":"Despite political support for the baccalaureate degree as entry to practice, historical concerns over nursing education - the value of education versus service, professional versus vocational identity and theoretical versus practical knowledge - persist. The authors challenge the notion of a \"two-tiered\" nursing system and call for a nationwide curriculum review to help the profession adapt to the changing needs of the Canadian healthcare system. ","281":"Leaders need to look far ahead, setting a course that \"excites and engages\" others in improving nurses' positive impact on health, throughout life and at the time of death. ","282":"When examining the qualities required to meet the future, it is clear that if nursing does not learn and adapt, it will not survive; if it does not survive and begin to shape its environment, then it will become irrelevant. ","283":"Nursing is on the verge of a major shift in both its work and its value due to increasing pressure to move out of acute-care hospitals and into the community; and the influence of digitization in how nurses are able to provide care. ","284":"Critical appraisal is a skill that nurses require. But how can they develop it? ","285":"There has been enormous progress in nursing, and that progress did not come without change. Nurses have two choices: to be a part of developing and leading the change, or to have change happen to them. ","286":"","287":"","288":"","289":"The global movement towards free trade and market integration has enabled greater mobility for skilled professionals, including nurses. As of 2015, newly graduated Canadian nurses will enter the register with an exam prepared by the US-based National Council of State Boards of Nursing, making Canadian nurses possibly the most mobile skilled workers in North America. But given the fragmentation of Canada's internal labour market, it is the United States that stands to benefit most from greater nurse mobility. ","290":"","291":"Although the licensed practical nurse (LPN) workforce represents an ever-growing and valuable human resource, very little is known about reasons for practical nurse mobility. The purpose of this study was to describe LPN perspectives regarding motives for inter-provincial\/territorial (P\/T) movement in Canada. Participants included 200 LPNs from nine P\/T, and data were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach. Three primary themes were identified regarding motivators for LPN migration, including (a) scope of practice, (b) education and advancement opportunities and (c) professional respect and recognition. Although current economic forces have a strong influence on nurse mobility, these findings emphasize that there are other equally important factors influencing LPNs to move between jurisdictions. As such, policy makers, administrators and researchers should further explore and address these themes in order to strengthen Canada's nursing workforce. ","292":"Understanding the experiences of nurses who have moved between the provinces and territories (P\/T) in Canada for work provides insight into the role of professional socialization in career decision-making. This paper analyzes some of the qualitative data arising from a survey of nurses from across Canada. The findings provide insight into nurses' professional socialization and demonstrate that early perceptions and expectations of nursing practice can influence future career decisions such as mobility and intent to remain. Participants described how \"caring\" and direct patient contact were central to their choice of nursing and career satisfaction. As the data reveal, nursing is also regarded as a career that enables mobility to accommodate both family considerations and professional development opportunities. The findings highlight the need for professional socialization strategies and supports that motivate Canadian nurses to continue practising within the profession and the country. ","293":"The purpose of this study was to explore how educational opportunities may affect nurses' decision to move within Canada. Thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained from 35 registered nurses and 35 licensed practical nurses highlighted educational opportunities available in Canada and how these influence nurses' decision to move across the country for work. The results indicate that Canadian nurses value continued learning but face several barriers while trying to further their education. Two main themes emerged: support for and access to continuing education. Canadian nurses perceive a lack of support, both financially and in the form of scheduling, for engaging in continuing education. Additionally, the lack of access to accredited continuing education programs was reported. The findings and implications of this study are examined within the context of nurse mobility. ","294":"Recent years have witnessed the publication of a growing number of studies of nursing which, from a disciplinary perspective, are geographical in their orientation. Conceptually, while the emphasis in much of this research has been focused at the micro scale on the dynamics between nursing and \"place,\" curiously there has been scant attention to geometrical \"space,\" and the basic yet important locational and distributive features of nursing at the macro scale. Noting this gap in the literature, the authors of this paper used a Geographical Information System (GIS) to map the movement of 199 nurses from two Canadian provinces where they were educated - Manitoba and Newfoundland - to the provinces where they currently live and work. While the findings show that nurses who move tend to move to nearby provinces, more generally they illustrate the effectiveness of GIS for managing data and representing findings from workforce studies. ","295":"The internal migration of nurses within Canada has had limited study. This paper reports the results of a survey of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who had migrated between the provinces and territories in Canada. Factors contributing to internal nurse mobility included seeking full-time work, opportunities for career advancement and flexible scheduling options. Few nurses received incentives to move between the provinces\/territories to work. A number of challenges with internal migration are identified, including complexities related to licensing and limitations in available job information. Implications for nursing health human resources policy related to nurse retention in Canada are identified and discussed. ","296":"Nurses who are early in their careers make important decisions that begin them on unique career trajectories. One of these decisions may be migration. Little is known about the experiences and career decisions made by early career nurses who were educated in Canada and are working in the United States. Focus groups were conducted with nine nurses to explore and describe their experiences. Utilizing the Learning Theory of Career Counselling as a framework, the analysis highlighted the environmental conditions and learning experiences described by the participants. Two themes were identified: early decisions and ongoing decisions. The career trajectories of these nurses were characterized by decision-making. They made decisions about becoming a nurse, where to work and in what clinical specialty. The learning experiences and environments to which they were exposed influenced their early decisions and continued to influence their ongoing decisions about returning to Canada. ","297":"The migration of nurses from Canada to the United States has occurred for decades, although substantial increases have been noted since the 1990s. A survey of 4,295 Canadian-educated nurses in the US identified that this trend in mobility is largely unchanged. Almost half the nurses in this study migrated to the US in search of full-time work, often after unsuccessfully seeking employment here in Canada prior to leaving. Incentives to migrate were provided, although the opportunity for full-time work was often perceived as an incentive to move. While some intent to return is apparent, this is unlikely to occur given the levels of satisfaction with work and the high value attributed to Canadian nurses by US employers. Policy makers and nurse leaders are urged to use these data to formulate strategies aimed at retaining Canada's nurses in this country. ","298":"","299":"Leadership and staff from the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) Nursing Resource Team (NRT), including members of their Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) Council, attended the first Southern Ontario Nursing Resource Team Conference (SONRTC), held March 2012 in Toronto. The SONRTC highlighted healthy work environments (HWEs), noting vast differences among the province's various organizations. Conversely, CQI Council members anecdotally acknowledged similar inconsistencies in HWEs across the various inpatient departments at LHSC. In fact, the mobility of the NRT role allows these nurses to make an unbiased observation about the culture, behaviours and practices of specific units as well as cross-reference departments regarding HWEs. Studies have documented that HWEs have a direct impact on the quality of patient care. Furthermore, the literature supports a relationship between HWEs and nurse job satisfaction. Based on this heightened awareness, the NRT CQI Council aimed to investigate HWEs at LHSC. The American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) Standards for Establishing and Sustaining Healthy Work Environments was adapted in developing a survey for measuring HWEs based on the perceptions of NRT staff. Each of the departments was evaluated in terms of the following indicators: skilled communication, true collaboration, effective decision-making, appropriate staffing, meaningful recognition and authentic leadership (AACN 2005). Ultimately, the Building a Healthy Work Environment: A Nursing Resource Team Perspective survey was employed with NRT nurses at LHSC, and data was collected for use by leadership and staff for creating HWE strategies aimed at improving the quality of patient care. ","300":"For nurses, the stress caused by entering a new place of employment may give rise to insecurity and a lack of confidence. Lack of confidence in one's nursing skills can affect performance and, ultimately, patient care and safety. In healthcare, growing fiscal constraints have resulted in lost resources, and support for new nursing staff is limited by both time and cost considerations. Clinical educators therefore must find innovative ways to provide education and support, including creative learning modalities that facilitate nurses' transition into a new role and work environment. ","301":"The dynamic world of healthcare requires continuous review of practice to ensure that patient care aligns with current evidence and best practice. Superficial subcutaneous lidocaine injection has been an order option at London Health Sciences Centre-University Hospital (LHSC-UH) for use in post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prior to femoral artery sheath removal (FASR). The purpose of administering lidocaine is to reduce pain during FASR, subsequently enhancing the patient's experience. A critical appraisal was performed by the Continuous Quality Improvement-Cardiac Care Council (CQI-CCC) at LHSC-UH, evaluating the effectiveness of superficial subcutaneous lidocaine for use in patients undergoing FASR. This paper details the process followed to evaluate this practice and reports on the subsequent findings and recommendations. A literature review, a retrospective chart audit, a blinded online survey and peer hospital polling were compiled, and a summary of findings was shared with the cardiac interventionists, with subsequent polling. No significant evidence for pain reduction was identified when lidocaine injections were administered prior to FASR. As such, a unanimous decision was reached to remove lidocaine from the LHSC Coronary Angioplasty Clinical Pathway order form.","302":"Hospitalized sub-acute medicine patients face challenges to their functional and cognitive abilities as they await transfer to long-term care facilities or return home. The Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) Council, representing a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working in the Sub-Acute Medicine Unit (SAMU), implemented a twice-weekly lunch program called the Lunch Bunch in order to combat depression and delirium in our elderly and cognitively impaired patients. The Lunch Bunch initiative includes chaplains, nurses and physiotherapists who have provided a framework through which essential socialization and exercise for this vulnerable population is facilitated. Providing a means for both mental and physical stimulation also allows patients to open up and discuss hidden feelings of loneliness and isolation, thereby beginning a journey of spiritual and emotional healing. ","303":"Early breast milk, known as colostrum (\"liquid gold\") provides immune benefits to infants, offering potential risk reduction for nosocomial infection (NI) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal emergency. Provision of colostrum is recognized as oral immune therapy (OIT) and is valuable to all NICU infants unable to feed orally. A quality improvement project was initiated by the multidisciplinary NICU Quality Care Council at London Health Sciences Centres-Victoria (LHSC-VH) to obtain mothers' colostrum for early OIT. The initiative was driven by the Canadian EPIQ (Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality) group as a means of reducing the rates of NEC and NI, two major morbidities in the NICU. The overall aim was to facilitate the availability of OIT to preterm and critically ill neonates as soon as possible after birth. ","304":"Suboptimal oral care is well documented in the literature and is linked to increased nosocomial pneumonia rates and prolonged hospitalization, negatively affecting patients' quality of life (Terezakis et al. 2011). A standardized approach to oral care can change these adverse outcomes. This project used best practice guidelines and evidence in the literature to guide the development of oral care best practice within an acute care inpatient unit. Based on the work of the interprofessional Clinical Neurological Sciences (CNS) Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) Council at London Health Sciences Centre-University Hospital (LHSC-UH), an oral care policy and bedside assessment tool were implemented in line with Stroke Best Practice Recommendations (Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada 2010). A validated, reliable and feasible oral health assessment tool (OHAT) was selected for implementation, and is now completed on every patient within 24 hours of admission to the CNS inpatient unit. Favourable outcomes to date include improved accessibility of oral health supplies, including regular and suction toothbrushes, toothpaste and bite blocks. Post-implementation audits indicate increased frequency and quality of oral care. This review provides a synopsis of how oral care best practice was implemented in an acute care neurology\/neurosurgery setting.","305":"The ICU at London Health Sciences Centre-University Hospital (LHSC-UH) is a 40-bed critical care unit that contains two separate supply rooms that carry all the essential materials necessary for patient care. However, considering the patient acuity in critical care, it is vital that this equipment is made more accessible for practitioners at the bedside. Therefore, nurse servers or bedside supply cabinets are present in each of the patient rooms. While these servers provide timely access to the supplies essential for nursing care, they are also a huge source of waste. When patients who are identified as having antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) are discharged, numerous unused items are discarded for infection control purposes. Project objectives were to curtail waste by minimizing stocked supplies at the bedside, exploring alternative stocking options and increasing awareness of this issue with practitioners. An interprofessional team was formed consisting of registered nurses, support service workers, environmental service workers, infection control practitioners and critical care leadership. A cost analysis of discarded supplies was undertaken, and results were communicated to all staff. Infection control practitioners developed guidelines specific to use of the nurse servers and linen supply areas. The stocking process and contents of the servers were reviewed; surplus was removed and relocated to a close central area outside patient rooms. Following agreement on new server contents, lists and photos were created and posted in each supply room. New stocking guidelines were phased in gradually and were adapted according to user feedback. Over a two-week period, a pilot cost analysis identified that supplies valued at $2,327.25 had been discarded from five bedsides. Future long-term cost savings will enable management to redirect such resources and therefore improve other essential care services in the ICU. Increasing awareness of wasteful stocking practices facilitated the engagement of this CQI project. New stocking practices have greatly reduced waste and increased service efficiencies while maintaining the integrity of optimal patient care. ","306":"Motivate, Innovate, Celebrate: an innovative shared governance model through the establishment of continuous quality improvement (CQI) councils was implemented across the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC). The model leverages agent-specific knowledge at the point of care and provides a structure aimed at building human resources capacity and sustaining enhancements to quality and safe care delivery. Interprofessional and cross-functional teams work through the CQI councils to identify, formulate, execute and evaluate CQI initiatives. In addition to a structure that facilitates collaboration, accountability and ownership, a corporate CQI Steering Committee provides the forum for scaling up and spreading this model. Point-of-care staff, clinical management and educators were trained in LEAN methodology and patient experience-based design to ensure sufficient knowledge and resources to support the implementation.

These issues raise ethical concerns, affecting the care workers provide to seniors and other recipients. This paper is derived from a subproject of a larger Canada-wide study, Safety at Home: A Pan-Canadian Home Care Safety Study, released in June 2013 by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute. Semi-structured, face-to-face, audiotaped interviews were conducted with providers, clients and informal caregivers in British Columbia, Manitoba and New Brunswick to better understand their perceptions of patient safety in home care. Using the BC data only, we then compared our findings to findings of other BC studies focusing on safety in home care that were conducted over the past decade. Through our interviews and comparative analyses it became clear that HSWs experienced significant inequities in providing home care. Utilizing a model depicting concerns of and for HSWs developed by Craven and colleagues (2012), we were able to illustrate the physical, spatial, interpersonal and temporal concerns set in the context of system design that emphasized the ethical dilemmas of HSWs in home care. Our data suggested the necessity of adding a fifth domain, organizational (system design). In this paper, we issue a call for stronger advocacy for home care and improved collaboration and resource equity between institutional care and community care. ","309":"Clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) are advanced practice nurses. They contribute to the quality and safety of patient care by providing an advanced level of clinical care to patients and families and by supporting healthcare team members to deliver evidence-based care. CNSs help to reduce healthcare costs when the roles are fully deployed and all the dimensions of the CNS role are implemented. The dimensions of the CNS role include clinical care, organizational leadership, research, education, professional development and consultation to provide patient care. There is a paucity of research on CNSs in Canada. We conducted the first Canada-wide survey of CNSs and asked each nursing regulatory body to identify the CNSs in their registration database. One-quarter (n=196\/776) of the regulator-identified CNS respondents whom we contacted for the study were no longer or had never been a CNS. Currently, adequate mechanisms are lacking to identify and track CNSs in Canada, and little is known about the factors that influence CNSs' decisions to leave their role. The non-employed CNS respondents in our survey highlighted that the lack of role clarity, their inability to find employment as a CNS and the inability to implement all the dimensions of the CNS role were key factors in their decision not to work as a CNS. These findings have important implications, given that these factors are potentially modifiable and amenable to decisions made by nursing leaders in organizations and regulatory bodies. Mechanisms to identify and track CNSs in Canada are needed to develop an effective workforce plan and maximize the integration of CNSs in the workforce.

As part of a larger quantitative study examining relationships between FLMs' SOC and performance outcomes, 10 manager focus groups were conducted by teleconference, involving 48 managers from 14 academic healthcare organizations. Themes and subthemes were identified according to (a) perceptions of the size and scope of SOC; (b) factors influencing the complexity of SOC; (c) supports needed to manage SOC; (d) changing leadership style; and (e) ways of coping with role overload. Participants described system demands as a significant contributor to their work responsibilities and a sense of role overload. About half of managers stated their SOC was unreasonable and that they lacked the necessary supports to manage it. Many managers who described their SOC as reasonable still expressed concerns about internal and external workload pressures that contributed to changing leadership style and role overload. Findings reinforce the importance of organizational strategies to create regular dialogue with FLMs regarding the size, complexity and appropriateness of current spans and to provide the resource supports necessary to ensure they can manage their SOC effectively.

Since the early 1990s, restructuring and the increasing pressure to save money and improve efficiency have plagued acute care hospitals. These changes have affected both the work environment and the work of nurses. After recognizing this impact, healthcare leaders have dedicated many efforts to improving the work environment in hospitals. Admirable in their intent, these initiatives have made little change for RNs and their work environment, and thus, an opportunity exists for other efforts. Research indicates that spirit at work (SAW) not only improves the work environment but also strengthens the nurse's power to improve patient outcomes and contribute to a high-quality workplace. In this paper, we present findings from our research that suggest SAW be considered an important component in improving the work environment in acute care hospitals. ","318":"The implementation of advanced practice nursing (APN) roles can yield improvements in patient and health system outcomes, and supportive leadership is integral in facilitating the implementation of such roles. The purpose of this study was to explore the awareness and understanding of APN roles among hospital decision-makers, and to learn about the information they require and the ways in which they prefer to receive that information. Fifteen administrators and leaders from two multi-site acute care organizations were interviewed. Their practical knowledge of APN roles was based on experience developing the roles or working with APNs in hospital programs. The most common sources of APN information were internal contacts (i.e., APNs) and documents from nursing organizations. Participants reported difficulty distinguishing between the roles of nurse practitioners (NPs) and clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and identified knowledge regarding CNS roles as their greatest need. They required specific information regarding the \"value-added\" benefits offered by an APN role. Strategies to address the knowledge gaps of healthcare leaders are urgently needed in order to support the implementation of new APN roles and to sustain existing ones. ","319":"Engaging clinical nurses in practice-based research is a cornerstone of professional nursing practice and a critical element in the delivery of high-quality patient care. Practising staff nurses are well suited to identify the phenomena and issues that are clinically relevant and appropriate for research. In response to the need to invest in and build capacity in nursing research, hospitals have developed creative approaches to spark interest in nursing research and to equip clinical nurses with research competencies. This paper outlines a Canadian hospital's efforts to build research capacity as a key strategy to foster efficacious, safe and cost-effective patient care practices. Within a multi-pronged framework, several strategies are described that collectively resulted in enhanced research and knowledge translation productivity aimed at improving the delivery of safe and high-quality patient care. ","320":"As Canadian health systems transform to meet changing needs, grounding nursing practice in evidence remains an essential goal for providing safe, high-quality care. nursing research facilitators (NRFs) are strengthening the use of evidence in nursing practice across the province of British Columbia. NRFs are nurses with a research background, whose work is focused on supporting people within health systems to use and do research in their practice and decision-making. Since this role was established in 2009, NRFs have provided facilitative support to over 50 funded research projects, led numerous workshops and journal clubs, and conducted more than 600 research-related consultations. In this paper, we discuss the role and offer exemplars of creative ways in which NRFs are strengthening nurses' engagement in doing and using research by developing capacity for research and evidence-informed practice, building meaningful partnerships and cultivating a culture of curiosity among nurses and other healthcare providers. We reflect on factors contributing to the success of this role and some of the challenges of integration. The paper concludes with a comment on the strategic value of the role.

Yet it arguably plays a less prominent role in charting the future course of the system than it should. As in any complex system, power matters in health, and the history of healthcare and gender relations explains a good deal of why nursing's influence has not rivaled that of medicine. But society has progressed immensely in the last century and nursing has both contributed to and benefited from these broader social trajectories. If the profession is to expand its leadership role in healthcare, it will have to reflect on its internal politics, its culture of representation and decision-making, and how to translate its diversity into a coherent change agenda. Perhaps above all it must champion and focus on the public interest to avoid being defined as just another interest group. ","327":"Healthcare institutions and providers are in complexity. Networks of interconnections from relationships and technology create conditions in which interdependencies and non-linear dynamics lead to surprising, unpredictable outcomes. Previous effective approaches to leadership, focusing on top-down bureaucratic methods, are no longer effective. Leading in complexity requires leaders to accept the complexity, create an adaptive space in which innovation and creativity can flourish and then integrate the successful practices that emerge into the formal organizational structure. Several methods for doing adaptive space work will be discussed. Readers will be able to contrast traditional leadership approaches with leading in complexity. They will learn new behaviours that are required of complexity leaders, along with challenges they will face, often from other leaders within the organization.

Nurses can also contribute in much wider spheres of influence by applying their knowledge and skills to address broader issues affecting population health across communities, nations and globally. Despite the prevalence of so many vexing health and social issues, nurses often fail to think globally, or even regionally, when they are lobbying for change. And while much political influence is local, some issues are simply too complex to rely on local influence alone. Importantly in all this, we must acknowledge the ways these complex health issues are shaped by economic and political agendas and not necessarily by healthcare agendas. As such, the nursing community has to act globally and locally, both within and outside of the nursing arena. This paper explores early thinking about an evolving model of spheres--or \"bubbles\"--of policy influence in which nurses can and must operate to more effectively impact key global health and healthcare challenges.","329":"The Canadian healthcare system must change to meet current and future realities, particularly to respond effectively to changing age and cultural demographics and new medical\/scientific technologies. To meet its ongoing policy role, the Canadian Nurses Association established a National Expert Commission in 2011, mandated to prepare a report on healthcare reform and transformation, with a clear focus on the role individual nurses and the nursing profession generally could play in ensuring better health, better care and better value for Canadians. In this paper, Commission co-chair, health law specialist Maureen McTeer, outlines the key findings and recommendations of their final report, titled A Nursing Call to Action: The Health of our Nation, the Future of our Health System which she and co-chair Dr. Marlene Smadu presented originally at the CNA's biennial meeting in Vancouver, in June, 2012.

","332":"The origin of future-proofing seems lost in the mists of recent history. Dictionaries date its use from about 1991, referring to the prevention of obsolescence in information technology manufacturing and occasionally in organizational systems. However, closer analysis in healthcare demonstrates it can be traced back to the Rand Corporation and the studies commissioned there in the 1960s. These aimed at identifying the predictive factors in planning healthcare, including development of the workforce. It is a managerial concept that helps to project a vision of change that is not simply reactive or short-term. It permits a focus on leadership and the maximising of learning opportunities and includes analysis of the policy horizon. It held within it an assumption about the importance of establishing the cognitive frameworks that would influence long-term behaviours and not focus simply on short-term gains. This paper utilises this approach to explore options for future-proofing of nurse education. ","333":"","334":"","335":"Nurse managers play pivotal roles in hospitals. However, restructuring has resulted in nurse managers having wider span of control and reduced visibility. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare two methods of measuring span of control: departmental complexity and number of direct reports. Forty-one nurse managers across nine hospitals completed The Ottawa Hospital Clinical Manager Span of Control Tool (TOH-SOC) and a demographic survey. A moderate positive relationship between number of direct reports and departmental complexity score was identified (r=.49, p=&lt;.01). Intensive care departments were more likely to be classified differently, using departmental complexity compared to number of direct reports (54%). TOH-SOC is a reliable instrument (Cronbach's alpha = .838). Using departmental complexity rather than direct reports may more accurately reflect the full scope of nurse managers' responsibility. ","336":"As part of efforts to improve patient safety, quality of care and patient- and family-centred care, there is a growing interest in moving away from traditional taped nursing reports or reporting at the nursing station to reporting at the bedside. Although a body of knowledge exists regarding what nurses view as benefits and challenges experienced in nurse-to-nurse bedside reporting, less is known about the perceptions of nurses who have experienced this change in reporting practice on their unit. In this context, a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken to explore nurses' perceptions of a newly implemented nurse-to-nurse bedside reporting practice at one acute care hospital. A total of 43 interviews were conducted on four units with seven nurses from respirology, 10 from obstetrics and gynecology, 10 from nephrology and 16 from general surgery. Data were analyzed using a directed content analysis approach. Three themes emerged that captured nurses' perceptions of the implementation of nurse-to-nurse bedside reporting: (a) being supported to change and embrace bedside reporting, (b) maintaining confidentiality and respecting patients' preferences and (c) experiencing challenges with bedside reporting. Our findings provide insight for other organizations in their efforts to change reporting practices. Specifically, there is a need for multi-pronged initiatives including leadership support, educational opportunities and ongoing monitoring and feedback mechanisms. Future research is required to examine how enablers can be leveraged and barriers mitigated or removed to ensure successful implementation and sustainability of nurse-to-nurse bedside reporting. ","337":"The number of people living longer is increasing, and those with physical or cognitive impairments may need admission into long-term care settings. In long-term care there is a need to increase nursing staff's capacity to meet the care needs of residents, develop a team approach to providing care and provide opportunities for staff to improve their knowledge and skills. One approach to meet these needs has been to employ a nurse practitioner (NP). The purpose of this paper is to examine nursing staff's perceptions of how working with an NP affected their ability to provide care, function as a team and increase their knowledge and skill. Data used in this paper were obtained from nursing staff and managers who participated in focus groups that were part of case studies conducted in the second phase of a larger sequential, two-phase mixed-methods study. NPs used multiple approaches to increase staff knowledge and skills and improve quality of care. These findings describe the benefits of employing NPs in long-term care settings.

This review was part of a larger project that had the ultimate goal of improving environmental management in rural and peri-urban communities in order to reduce infant and under-five mortality rates, thereby addressing three of the UN Millennium Development Goals. Participants from two post-secondary educational institutions in Zambia and a non-governmental organization spent five days together reviewing the theoretical and practical components of the program. Theoretical content, practice opportunities and demonstrable student competencies were updated within existing resources. The collegiality and respect among the participants from many disciplines provided the basis for a positive experience in intersectoral collaboration and global health. ","345":"The aim of the study was to survey nurses, patients and families regarding their perceptions of nursing attire, identification and professional image. Recent changes in uniform policies have made it difficult for patients to identify the nurse. A convenience sample of nurses (RNs, RPNs) and patients and families from an acute care facility in Canada were surveyed. Surveys included a combination of forced-choice questions and open text boxes. Quantitative data were analyzed, and a thematic content analysis was conducted. The nurse survey resulted in a 64% (n=642) response rate; the patient\/family survey response rate was 70% (n=30). Fifty-three per cent of the patient\/family advisory team members reported that the nurses did not look professional in comparison to 95% of the nurses who indicated they did. Three key themes emerged: professional image, nurse identification and adoption of a standardized uniform. Professional comportment of nurses includes attire suitable for the clinical area that reflects a professional image and allows patients and families to identify the nurses. This study identified the need to engage nurses, patients and families to ensure professional comportment when uniform polices are developed.

Employed nurses have had to participate in organizational activities that undermine their professional values and goals. Nursing entrepreneurship presents an opportunity to explore nursing's professional potential in nursing practice that is uniquely independent. In this study, a focused ethnographic approach was used to explore the experiences of self-employed nurses, who see themselves as leaders in advancing the profession of nursing and its contribution to healthcare. Key themes in the findings include the responses of self-employed nurses to health system change, expanded roles for nurses, the consequences of this non-traditional approach to nursing work and the possibilities for change that arise from nursing entrepreneurship.

Increasing healthcare demands continue to shape the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) role, especially in the area of palliative care. Clinical nurse specialists bring specialized knowledge, skills and leadership to the clinical setting to enhance patient and family care. This paper highlights the clinical leadership role of the CNS as triage leader for a hospital-based palliative care consulting team. Changes to the team's referral and triage processes are emphasized as key improvements to team efficiency and timely access to care for patients and families. ","366":"In 2007, Health Canada proposed a new framework to regulate prescriptive authority for controlled substances, titled New Classes of Practitioners Regulations (NCPR). The new regulatory framework was passed in November 2012; it gives nurse practitioners (NPs), midwives and podiatrists the authority to prescribe controlled medications under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. It is expected that authorizing NPs to write prescriptions for certain controlled substances commonly used in primary care will enhance flexibility and timeliness in primary care service delivery. Studies from the United States have shown positive outcomes in primary care access, decreased healthcare costs and the evolution and advancement of the NP role when prescriptive authority was expanded to include controlled substances. The purpose of this paper is to examine how NPs' prescriptive authority for controlled substances affects access to primary care and NP role development. Three key issues identified from the experience of one group of NPs in the United States (access to care, professional autonomy and prescriber knowledge) offer insight into the practice changes that may be anticipated for NPs in Canada now that they have acquired prescriptive authority for controlled substances. Recommendations are offered to assist nurse leaders and educators to best support NPs as they take on this new and important role responsibility.

This paper describes the perceptions of ACPF fellows regarding their influence on quality of care and patient outcomes, specifically, the types of practice change activities initiated, successful implementation and influence on outcomes, barriers encountered and strategies used to address them and influence change. Thirty telephone interviews were conducted with ACPF fellows after completing their fellowship. Interviews were analyzed using descriptive content analysis. Fifty-one practice change activities were identified. Ratings for successful implementation (1 = not successful, 10 = extremely successful) were 7.2\/10; ratings for successful influence on outcomes were 7.4\/10. Barriers identified were (a) resistant attitudes, (b) time and workload, (c) lack of administrative support and (d) lack of mentor's involvement. Strategies proposed were (a) building a knowledge base, (b) negotiation and dialogue and (c) self-reliance and persistence. The ACPF program is an innovative and highly utilized initiative.

Recruitment of internationally educated nurses is often seen as a solution to ongoing nursing shortages. However, international recruitment needs to be accompanied by strategies to ensure long-term retention. One of the criteria for successful retention is the availability and accessibility of career advancement and educational opportunities. Little research exists on the opportunities for career advancement and education for internationally educated nurses in Canada. This interpretive descriptive study was conducted to look at the perceptions of internationally educated nurses regarding career advancement and educational opportunities in Alberta, Canada. Eleven internationally educated nurses, working as registered nurses in Alberta, were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Five themes were identified: motherhood as a priority, communication and cultural challenges, process of skill recognition, perceptions of opportunity and need for mentorship.","373":"A unique and innovative model of primary healthcare (PHC) delivery began at the Sudbury District Nurse Practitioner Clinics (SDNPC) in 2007. Significant growth and development has taken place since the opening of this new model of PHC delivery. Now that SDNPC is operating at full capacity, an evaluation was warranted of patient experiences with clinic services and the level of overall patient satisfaction. A survey of clinic patients was conducted in the spring of 2011. Results demonstrated high satisfaction with clinic services. Some areas were identified for review, including the level of accessibility to same-day appointments and rationale for patient use of walk-in clinics and emergency department care. One of the strengths and benefits of this model of NP care was demonstrated in this evaluation, whereby a majority of patients identified that they had received counselling about a lifestyle issue and, of those patients, most reported a resulting positive health-related behavioural change. Ongoing comprehensive evaluation is important to ensure that services are efficient and directed to optimal patient health outcomes.","374":"Over the past decade, Nova Scotia has been making important changes to strengthen its primary healthcare (PHC) system. Here we present the results from an observational, retrospective study evaluating the effect of an enhanced collaborative care model, which included team building and the addition of a nurse practitioner (NP) to the team, on the quality of healthcare delivery among a community, PHC population. To guide the evaluation, we used a broad range of national and provincially identified clinical quality-of-care indicators targeting a wide range of preventive and chronic disease management care (targeting process of care, and immediate and secondary outcomes). A total of 392 patient charts were audited (197 pre-period; 195 post-period). Patients included the full spectrum of the practice population - the young, the old, those with chronic conditions and others without. Results support the increasing body of evidence, which indicates improved chronic disease management among patients with targeted chronic conditions, particularly patients diagnosed with diabetes, who receive care through a collaborative practice where a NP is part of the team. In addition, these results also demonstrate the beginning of better preventive care among all patients.","375":"Recent research reveals a need for improved leadership capabilities among nurses, from the front-line nurse to those in management capacities. This \"op-ed\" piece is a discussion arising from the results of a study examining two groups of high school students: one participating in a leadership training program and one not participating. With their responses, these students demonstrated a stereotypical view of the work of nurses and were not interested in pursuing a career in nursing. They also didn't see nursing as a career in which to practise their leadership abilities. We raise questions about our ability to meet the goals of the Canadian Nursing Association as set out in Toward 2020 if we, in the nursing profession, are not successful in attracting students who understand the complexities of nursing practice and have a desire and the ability to help advance the profession in Canada.

The mandate of all self-regulatory bodies for the health professions in Ontario is protection of the public. Self-regulating professions monitor and enforce standards for entry to practice and continuing competence. Nurse leaders in education and clinical practice must be aware of these changes to the regulatory structure for health professions in Ontario. This paper describes the concept of self-regulation and its legislative history within the health professions. Nurse leaders have an important role in ensuring that team members, patients and the public are aware of the meaning of and rationale for self-regulation and the primacy of protecting the public interest.","380":"The clinical nurse specialist (CNS) role is often misunderstood and underutilized. Through partnership with the CNS Advisory Committee in the Horizon Health Network and the Masters of Nursing Program at the University of New Brunswick, the authors developed a clear articulation and visual representation of the CNS role in New Brunswick. This paper synthesizes information gleaned from interviews with the clinical nurse specialists working within Horizon Health Network and integrates this information with the published literature and the position statement of the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA). Vision, voice and value emerged as key considerations, as did barriers to, and successes of, the CNS role. This paper contributes to the acquisition of knowledge regarding the role of the CNS according to the CNA and current published literature. It further promotes an understanding of the important role of the CNS in the healthcare system in New Brunswick, and introduces strategies that can be utilized by clinical nurse specialists to demonstrate value and support the continuation of the role.","381":"","382":"The current healthcare system is slowly evolving into a new system built on a vision of health promotion, primary care and community-based home care, with hospitals still being a core pillar of the healthcare system but not its primary service. This transformation requires a new approach to practice, namely, Strengths-Based Nursing Care (SBC). SBC is about mobilizing, capitalizing and developing a person's strengths to promote health and facilitate healing. For nurses to practise SBNC requires strong nursing leadership that creates conditions to enable them to do so. Strengths-Based Nursing Leadership complements and acts in synergy with, SBNC.

This silence is often represented as a lack of voice. However, in our study, we found that nurses who responded to questions about moral distress were not so much silent as silenced. These nurses were enacting their moral agency by engaging in diverse, multiple and time-consuming actions in response to situations identified as morally distressing with families, colleagues, physicians, educators or managers. In many situations, they took action by contacting other healthcare team members, making referrals and coordinating care with other departments such as home care and hospice, as well as initiating contact with groups such as professional regulatory bodies or unions. Examining the relationship between ethical climate, moral distress and voice offers insights into both the meaning and impact of being silenced in the workplace.","388":"In the aftermath of healthcare restructuring, it is important to pay attention to nurses' perceptions of workplace and professional practice factors that attract nurses and influence their retention. Continuing constraints on cancer care systems make the issue of health human resources an ongoing priority. This paper presents the findings of a follow-up study of a cohort of Canadian oncology nurses that aimed to compare nurses' perceptions of their work environment, job satisfaction and retention over a two-year period. Participants of the follow-up survey represented 65% (397\/615) of the initial cohort. Many similar perceptions about the work environment were found over two years; however, at follow-up a larger proportion of nurses reported an absence of enough RNs to provide quality care and a lack of support for innovative ideas. With respect to career status, only 6% (25\/397) of the follow-up sample had left oncology nursing. However, the proportion of nurses declaring an intention to leave their current job increased from 6.4% (39\/615) on the initial survey to 26% (102\/397) on the follow-up survey. Findings suggest that decision-makers need to use both the growing body of workplace knowledge and the input from staff nurses to implement changes that positively influence nurse recruitment and retention. Future research should focus on the implementation and evaluation of strategies that address workplace issues such as nurse staffing adequacy, leadership and organizational commitment.","389":"Critical care units are particularly affected by the shortage of nurses. In order to overcome this problem, many organizations have increased the hiring of newly graduated nurses. This paper describes a residency program developed to facilitate the safe integration of those nurses into critical care and its outcomes. A one-year nursing residency program dedicated to nurses with less than a year of experience was implemented in 2008. Recruitment and retention rates, as well as accessibility to critical care, were evaluated. A 46% increase in recruitment rate of newly graduated nurses was observed when comparing the same period of time before and after implementation of the program. Moreover, the one-year retention rate rose by 26%; the retention rate, without considering the time since the beginning of employment, rose by 71%. As for accessibility to critical care, it increased by 50% (from 24 to 36 beds). Finally, the program was favourably evaluated by experienced nurses in terms of skills and critical thinking development among nursing residents. A nursing residency program developed to meet the needs of inexperienced nurses and integrate them into high-acuity settings appears to be one solution to resolving undesirable limited access to safe-quality critical care.

Organizational benefits, such as data comparability, effective patient care planning and delivery and enhancement of nurses' technology skills were identified. Challenges that were highlighted included attaining buy-in from staff nurses, integration of HOBIC into existing computer systems and the subsequent computer and information technology challenges related to implementing such a program. Additional education and support for nursing staff and management were suggested as approaches for overcoming barriers. This survey demonstrates interest and commitment to HOBIC from many nurse leaders in Ontario and highlights the value that such a program provides for staff nurses in the planning and implementation of care. Nurse leaders in Ontario are keenly aware of the important potential that HOBIC data can provide for high-quality patient care and have identified key factors that need to be considered with the implementation of such a program.","393":"Ontario's Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care (HOBIC) is designed to help organizations and nurses plan and evaluate care by comparing patient outcomes with historical data on similar cases. Yet, fewer than 15% of patients in a 2010 study were found to have complete admission and discharge data sets. This low utilization rate of HOBIC measures prompted the current qualitative study, in which nurses from three clinical settings in an academic teaching hospital were interviewed to gain their perceptions related to collecting and using HOBIC measures in practice. The objective was to identify factors that promote or impede the collection and use of HOBIC data in clinical practice to improve patient care and outcomes. Analysis of interview results produced four key themes related to (a) use of HOBIC measures to inform patient care, (b) collecting and documenting HOBIC measures, (c) HOBIC as an afterthought and \"black hole\" and (d) impediments to assessing and documenting HOBIC measures because of language barriers, patients' cognitive status and lack of time.

The Dashboard access link was installed in computers in eight nursing units within the Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) network. The Dashboard indicators are populated from existing information\/patient databases within the Decision Support Department at HHS. Committees composed of the unit manager, staff nurses, project coordinator, financial controller and an information controller met regularly to review the Dashboard indicators. Participants discussed the ability of the indicators to reflect their patients' needs and the feasibility of using the indicators to inform their clinical staffing plans. Project findings suggest that the Dashboard is a work in progress. Many of the indicators that had originally been incorporated were refined and will continue to be revised based on suggestions from project participants and further testing across HHS. Participants suggested the need for additional data, such as the time that nurses are off the unit (for code blue response, patient transfers and accompanying patients for tests); internal transfers\/bed moves to accommodate patient-specific issues and particularly to address infection control issues; deaths and specific unit-centred data in addition to the generic indicators.

The model allows nurse participants to spend 20% of their paid time pursuing a professional development activity instead of providing direct patient care. Newfoundland and Labrador has the highest aging demographic in Canada owing, in part, to the out-migration of younger adults. Recruiting and retaining nurses to work in long-term care in the province is difficult; at the same time, the increasing acuity of long-term care residents and their complex care needs mean that nurses must assume greater leadership roles in these facilities. This project set out to increase capacity for registered nurse (RN) leadership, training and support and to enhance the profile of long-term care as a place to work. Six RNs and one licensed practical nurse (LPN) participated and engaged in a range of professional development activities.

As a first step to deal with this gap, we address how the CNS role has been conceptualized and studied in Canada. Because the CNS is a clinical leader with a primary focus on improving the quality of nursing and patient care, we propose the Spheres of Influence Model for studying the contributions of the CNS. This model directs attention to various research questions, which are illustrated with sample questions for each of the spheres of influence: the patient\/client sphere, the nurses\/nursing sphere and the organizations\/health systems sphere.

In this paper, we share how a series of practitioner-led Ethics in Practice sessions (EIPs), which originated within a busy urban teaching hospital, were adapted and translated, first into home care and more recently, into an EIP session for public health nurses. The success of EIP sessions rests with their focus on issues that are selected by practitioners. The aims of EIPs are to foster ethical leadership within communities of practice, create safe places to share concerns, use relevant research evidence and other literature to support informed discussion, and generate stories that deepen our understanding of the ethical situations we encounter in our work.

Specifically, we were interested in determining (a) whether relationships among the HOBIC measures exist and (b) whether any of the HOBIC measures are associated with, and could subsequently be used to predict, the patient and the destination to which he or she is discharged (ALC). Our interest in understanding these relationships and predictive abilities was both research driven and practice driven, with the intent eventually to use study findings to target clinical practice and data feedback strategies. To address the two research aims, this study employed both descriptive and inferential statistical approaches with multiple analytic approaches. Study results suggest that many of the HOBIC measures are related, with a higher score in one measure corresponding to a higher score in another measure. The exception is the therapeutic self-care (TSC) measure, in which higher scores on other HOBIC measures were correlated with lower TSC scores. Associations were also found with the predictive ability of certain HOBIC measures on LOS and ALC. Our study findings call for nurse leaders to emphasize the importance to clinical nurses on hospital units of focusing their efforts on assisting patients in managing their fatigue and dyspnoea effectively; increasing their ability to engage in activities of daily living, functional status and therapeutic self-care; and preventing or minimizing pressure ulcers and falls in acute care patients. In turn, these efforts may decrease patients' LOS. ","425":"This study explored the process of how power is exercised in nurse-manager relationships in the hospital setting, to better understand what fosters and constrains staff nurse empowerment. Semi-structured interviews and participant observations were conducted with 26 participants in a hospital in Western Canada. Seeking connectivity was the basic social process in which nurses strive to connect with their manager to create a workable partnership in the provision of high-quality patient care while responding to the demands of the organizational context. The overarching finding was that the manager plays a critical role in modifying the work environment for nurses and, as such, nurses seek connection with their manager. Findings revealed two patterns within the process of seeking connectivity: (a) in the absence of a meaningful engagement with the manager, power was held over nurses through institutional patterns of behaviour and practices, and nurses employed a variety of resistance strategies; (b) when managers provided guidance and engaged nurses as co-collaborators, power was shared and nurses were able to influence patient outcomes positively. The results of this study support Laschinger's program of research on nurse empowerment from an organizational perspective, and advance nurse empowerment from a critical perspective. ","426":"","427":"In a recent brief to the Canadian Nurses Association's National Expert Commission on the Health of Our Nation, the Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses (ACEN) discussed leadership needs in the Canadian healthcare system, and promoted the pivotal role of nursing executives in transforming Canada's healthcare system into an integrated patient-centric system. Included among several recommendations was the need to develop innovative leadership competencies that enable nurse leaders to lead and advance transformative health system change. This paper focuses on an emerging \"avant-garde executive leadership competency\" recommended for today's health leaders to guide health system transformation. Specifically, this competency is articulated as \"state of the art communication and technology savvy,\" and it implies linkages between nursing informatics competencies and transformational leadership roles for nurse executive. The authors of this paper propose that distinct nursing informatics competencies are required to augment traditional executive skills to support transformational outcomes of safe, integrated, high-quality care delivery through knowledge-driven care. International trends involving nursing informatics competencies and the evolution of new corporate informatics roles, such as chief nursing informatics officers (CNIOs), are demonstrating value and advanced transformational leadership as nursing executive roles that are informed by clinical data.

Using data from the 2005 National Survey of the Work and Health of Nurses (NSWHN), this study finds that male nurses do have higher odds of being in a higher income bracket if they are registered nurses. Further, male nurses who work as registered psychiatric nurses have a very small, but higher likelihood of being in a supervisory position, thus providing small evidence of the existence of a glass escalator within the labour market for nurses in Canada.","431":"Using findings from our recent study that found that a context of uncertainty in the work environment hindered nurses' research utilization, we suggest strategies for nurse managers and leaders to optimize clinical environments and support efforts to put research into clinical practice (knowledge translation). Two important sources of uncertainty were the complexity of teamwork and inconsistency in management and leadership styles. To reduce the uncertainty arising from teamwork, we propose (a) clarifying nurses' scopes of practice, (b) increasing knowledge sharing through supporting journal clubs and enhanced computer access and (c) creating safe venues for multidisciplinary dialogue. To reduce uncertainty arising from variations in management and leadership, we propose (a) developing policies that enhance the consistency of leadership and clarify the strategic direction of the management team, (b) clearly communicating those policies to nurses and (c) providing explicit rationales for treatment changes. Small, incremental steps can be taken to realize substantive changes in clinical environments in order to optimize nursing work environments for knowledge translation.","432":"This pilot study explored (a) front-line nurse managers' stressor experiences and (b) coping strategies used in order to respond to the myriad of challenges and demands of their role. The nurse managers who participated indicated that limited resources, ever-increasing challenges and work expectations contributed to the stressors they experience. Coping responses included support, cognitive, personal and social strategies, but findings indicated managers still lacked the ability to cope effectively. Managers faced considerable job stress and conflicting demands, often caught between focusing on staff relations and organizational productivity. Equipping managers with appropriate preparation and support may make the role of nurse manager more attractive and facilitate succession planning. These findings will assist senior nurse leaders in formulating directives for appropriate structures and processes in advancing a multidimensional approach to support managers. Resolving this issue is critical for creating reasonable and realistic work expectations for nurse managers and for supporting the pivotal role that managers play to achieve organizational outcomes while preserving their personal health and well-being.","433":"Nurse leaders can positively influence practice environments through a number of empowerment strategies, among them professional practice models. These models encompass the philosophy, structures and processes that support nurses' control over their practice and their voice within healthcare organizations. Nurse-driven professional practice models can serve as a framework for collaborative decision-making among nursing and other staff. This paper describes a provincewide pilot project in which eight nurse-led project teams in four healthcare sectors worked with the synergy professional practice model and its patient characteristics tool. The teams learned how the model and tool can be used to classify patients' acuity levels and make staffing assignments based on a \"best fit\" between patient needs and staff competencies. The patient characteristics tool scores patients' acuities on eight characteristics such as stability, vulnerability and resource availability. This tool can be used to make real-time patient assessments. Other potential applications for the model and tool are presented, such as care planning, team-building and determining appropriate staffing levels. Our pilot project evidence suggests that the synergy model and its patient characteristics tool may be an empowerment strategy that nursing leaders can use to enhance their practice environments.","434":"","435":"The authors describe what they have learned from 10 years as designers and facilitators of the award-winning Dorothy Wylie Nursing and Health Leaders Institutes. Since 2001 they have offered 23 institutes to over 2,200 existing and emerging health leaders to promote their leadership development and learning. As well, they have supported the development and execution of close to 900 leadership application projects initiated by participants for their organizations. The authors offer knowledge and insights related to three key areas: (a) the individual (the leadership aspirant or learner), (b) the organization's role in supporting leadership development and (c) leadership program design.","436":"","437":"","438":"","439":"","440":"A study was undertaken with nurse practitioners (NPs) in 2008-2009 to examine post-legislation role development in British Columbia. The authors used a participatory action research approach to engage NPs in social investigation, education and action, and to explore, from the participants' perspective, how collaboration advances NP role integration in primary healthcare. A particular discovery of the study was the Interior Health Authority Community of Practice (CoP) established in collaboration with health leaders and NPs. The purpose of this paper is to report on the CoP and the five characteristics describing this collaborative CoP model, including sanctioned social structure, knowledge exchange network, practice discovery and innovation, generating meaning and value, and power sharing for strategic improvement. The CoP helped NPs to build collegial and collaborative relationships, enhance practice learning and competence, extend and apply new knowledge, enrich professional identities, and shape health organizational policy and politics. Because healthcare research about CoPs is limited, principles of a collaborative CoP model are offered for broader healthcare use. The authors conclude that a collaborative CoP model addresses the internal interests and needs of participating members while attending to the external concerns of the organization, and thus contributes to healthcare improvement.","441":"Many new graduate nurses find the first year of work stressful and, because of this, consider leaving their employer early in their career. The purpose of this study is to describe new graduate nurses' experiences during their first year of practice and to explore factors that may lead them to consider leaving their employer. We held semi-structured interviews with 23 new graduate nurses in New Brunswick. Five themes emerged from the data: surviving the first months; induction into the hospital culture; struggling to maintain a balance; being a nurse: assuming a professional role; and strategic choices: looking at the future. The findings suggest that the first year at work continues to be difficult for new graduates. Several participants changed jobs during their first year, and several others were seriously considering leaving. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons new graduate nurses decide to leave and describes strategies that may assist in retaining this important group of healthcare providers.","442":"In Canada, the nursing shortage is all encompassing, and nurse leaders are needed from the bedside to the boardroom. Healthcare organizations and the nursing profession lag behind the corporate sector in development of strategic leadership succession planning. Contemporary nurse leaders will require all the knowledge, skills, attitudes and competencies their predecessors can provide. Effective leadership development and succession planning will provide a climate that is conducive to the transfer of that knowledge. Providing leadership development opportunities within the context of succession planning will assist nurses to develop and nurture the leader within. A definitive strategic succession plan may mean the difference between success and failure for nurses and their organizations.","443":"The innovation described in this paper was motivated by concern that in Africa, parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs is associated with irrational drug use where health facilities are inaccessible. However, advancement in digital technology, simple diagnostic devices and smart drug packaging inspire innovative strategies. The combination of communication technology, rapid diagnostic tools, and antibiotic and antimalarial medicines can increase access to evidence-based malaria management, reduce mortality and slow the development of resistance to drugs. The author initiated development of a solar-powered device (Feverkit) programmed with user-interactive capabilities and equipped with a detachable laboratory and dispensary for community management of fevers. The operational performance of 10 units of the device was evaluated among 20 nomadic Fulani communities in northeastern Nigeria. A brief introduction to its parts and functions was sufficient for community-selected nomadic caregivers to use it competently for managing 207 fever cases in eight weeks, with a 97% (p=.000) recovery rate. The Feverkit guided the nomads to distinguish between malaria and non-malaria-induced fevers, and thus selectively treat them. Camp communities accepted the device and were willing to pay between US$33 and $334 (mean, $113; mode, $67) to keep it. Public-private sector collaboration is essential for sustaining and scaling up production of the Feverkit as a commercial health device for the management of fevers among nomads.","444":"This paper is an abridged version of a knowledge synthesis undertaken to inform the proceedings of a collaborative forum of nurse leaders convened under the auspices of Health Canada, the Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses, the Canadian Nurses Association and Canada Health Infoway for the purpose of discussing the development of a nursing report card for Canada. The synthesis summarized the state of the science in the measurement of nursing-sensitive outcomes and the utilization of nursing report cards - information that informed forum participants' dialogue and planning. This condensed version of the synthesis focuses on initiatives related to outcomes and performance monitoring in nursing, including specific indicators and reporting systems and the development, implementation and utilization of nursing report cards.","445":"","446":"","447":"","448":"","449":"","450":"","451":"Avoidable emergency department (ED) visits are a source of clinical risk, stress and anxiety for older, more vulnerable patients. The complexity of health conditions and the unique challenges associated with the care of older patients can also contribute to overcrowding and longer wait times in EDs--issues of significant concern for both healthcare providers and patients. Generally, older patients are more likely than younger patients to visit EDs and be admitted to hospital. In addition, older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes are more likely to be transferred to EDs for preventable issues than those living in other settings. This paper describes how mobilizing a team of registered nurses working at full scope of practice might reduce the number of avoidable transfers of older patients to the ED. Utilizing nurses in this capacity demonstrates how the nursing profession can drive systemwide change to improve care between healthcare sectors for older adults.","452":"The authors give an overview of one healthcare organization's experience in developing a nursing strategic plan and nursing balanced scorecard (NBS) using a focused planning process involving strategy mapping. The NBS is being used at this organization to manage the nursing strategic plan by leveraging and improving nursing processes and organizational capabilities as required, based on data and transparent communication of performance results to key stakeholders. Key strategies and insights may help other nurse leaders in developing or refining strategic approaches to measuring nursing performance. Vital to the success of an organization's strategic plan are ongoing endorsement, engagement and visibility of senior leaders. Quality of decisions made depends on the organization's ability to collect data from multiple sources using standardized definitions, mine data and extract them for statistical analysis and effectively present them in a compelling and understandable way to users and decision-makers.","453":"The nursing profession is currently experiencing a shift to community care, more complex clients and a shortage of human resources.

Nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly becoming integral members of primary healthcare teams across the country. This paper draws on the results of a scoping review of the literature and qualitative key informant interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis about advanced practice nursing in Canada. We describe and analyze two novel approaches to NP integration designed to address the gap in patient access to primary healthcare: (1) the integration of NPs in traditional fee-for-service practices in British Columbia, and (2) the creation of NP-led clinics in Ontario. Although fee-for-service remuneration has been a barrier to collaborative practice, the integration of government-salaried NPs into fee-for-service practices in British Columbia has enabled the creation of inter-professional teams, and based on early evaluation findings, has increased patient access to care and patient and provider satisfaction. NP-led clinics are designed to provide inter-professional care in communities with high numbers of patients who do not have a regular primary healthcare provider. Given the shortage of physicians in communities where these clinics are being introduced, the ratio of physicians to NPs is lower than in other primary healthcare delivery models, and physicians function in more of a consulting role. Initial evaluation of the first of 26 NP-led clinics indicates increased access to care and high levels of patient and provider satisfaction. Implementing a creative mosaic of collaborative primary healthcare models that are responsive to patient needs challenges traditional assumptions about professional roles and responsibilities. To address this challenge, we endorse a recommendation that governments establish a mechanism to bring together both physician and non-physician primary healthcare providers to advise on primary healthcare policy development and implementation.","462":"Although advanced practice nurses (APNs) have existed in Canada for over 40 years and there is abundant evidence of their safety and effectiveness, their full integration into our healthcare system has not been fully realized. For this paper, we drew on pertinent sections of a scoping review of the Canadian literature from 1990 onward and interviews or focus groups with 81 key informants conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing to identify the factors that enable role development and implementation across the three types of APNs: clinical nurse specialists, primary healthcare nurse practitioners and acute care nurse practitioners. For development of advanced practice nursing roles, many of the enabling factors occur at the federal\/provincial\/territorial (F\/P\/T) level. They include utilization of a pan-Canadian approach, provision of high-quality education, and development of appropriate legislative and regulatory mechanisms. Systematic planning to guide role development is needed at both the F\/P\/T and organizational levels. For implementation of advanced practice nursing roles, some of the enabling factors require action at the F\/P\/T level. They include recruitment and retention, role funding, intra-professional relations between clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, public awareness, national leadership support and role evaluation. Factors requiring action at the level of the organization include role clarity, healthcare setting support, implementation of all role components and continuing education. Finally, inter-professional relations require action at both the F\/P\/T and organizational levels. A multidisciplinary roundtable formulated policy and practice recommendations based on the synthesis findings, and these are summarized in this paper.","463":"Title confusion and lack of role clarity pose barriers to the integration of advanced practice nursing roles (i.e., clinical nurse specialist [CNS] and nurse practitioner [NP]). Lack of awareness and understanding about NP and CNS roles among the healthcare team and the public contributes to ambiguous role expectations, confusion about NP and CNS scopes of practice and turf protection. This paper draws on the results of a scoping review of the literature and qualitative key informant interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis commissioned by the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation and the Office of Nursing Policy in Health Canada. The goal of this synthesis was to develop a better understanding of advanced practice nursing roles and the factors that influence their effective development and integration in the Canadian healthcare system. Specific recommendations from interview participants and the literature to enhance title and role clarity included the use of consistent titles for NP and CNS roles; the creation of a vision statement to articulate the role of CNSs and NPs across settings; the use of a systematic planning process to guide role development and implementation; the development of a communication strategy to educate healthcare professionals, the public and employers about the roles; attention to inter-professional team dynamics when introducing these new roles; and addressing inter-professionalism in all health professional education program curricula.","464":"Nursing leaders play a critical role in creating and enacting a vision for collaborative practice with advanced practice nurses (APNs). In this special issue, Nancy Carter and colleagues have identified many important influences and outcomes of successful nursing leadership in the context of promoting advanced practice nursing roles. The authors make a strong case for the importance of nursing leadership to facilitate large-scale systems change, noting the multiple levels on which nursing leaders work to ensure advanced practice nursing roles are well introduced to improve patient care. Nursing leadership can move an innovation like advanced practice nursing practice forward toward the \"tipping point,\" when the new idea takes hold and becomes socially acceptable and desired, when the early adopters have influenced the early majority and about 15 to 20% of the population have adopted the idea (Berwick 2003). In many ways our nursing leaders have achieved this with advanced practice nursing roles, and we should celebrate. APNs are now more common, and certainly members of the public are proud to speak of the roles APNs play in their health services. An idea that once captured the minds of a select few has spread, thanks in large part to the nursing leaders who had a vision, believed in an idea, fought for it and worked to embed the change in the system.","465":"Supportive nursing leadership is important for the successful introduction and implementation of advanced practice nursing roles in Canadian healthcare settings. For this paper, we drew on pertinent sections of a scoping review of the literature and key informant interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing to describe and explore organizational leadership in planning and implementing advanced practice nursing roles. Leadership strategies that optimize successful role integration include initiating systematic planning to develop the roles based on patient and community needs, engaging stakeholders, using established Canadian role implementation toolkits, ensuring utilization of all dimensions of the role, communicating clear messages to increase awareness about the roles in the organization, creating networks and facilitating mentorship for those in the role, and negotiating role expectations with physicians and other members of the healthcare team. Leaders face challenges in creating and securing sustainable funding for the roles and providing adequate infrastructure support.","466":"The clinical nurse specialist (CNS) provides an important clinical leadership role for the nursing profession and broader healthcare system; yet the prominence and deployment of this role have fluctuated in Canada over the past 40 years. This paper draws on the results of a decision support synthesis examining advanced practice nursing roles in Canada. The synthesis included a scoping review of the Canadian and international literature and in-depth interviews with key informants including CNSs, nurse practitioners, other health providers, educators, healthcare administrators, nursing regulators and government policy makers. Key challenges to the full integration of CNSs in the Canadian healthcare system include the paucity of Canadian research to inform CNS role implementation, absence of a common vision for the CNS role in Canada, lack of a CNS credentialing mechanism and limited access to CNS-specific graduate education. Recommendations for maximizing the potential and long-term sustainability of the CNS role to achieve important patient, provider and health system outcomes in Canada are provided.","467":"The acute care nurse practitioner (ACNP) role was developed in Canada in the late 1980s to offset rapidly increasing physician workloads in acute care settings and to address the lack of continuity of care for seriously ill patients and increased complexity of care delivery. These challenges provided an opportunity to develop an advanced practice nursing role to care for critically ill patients with the intent of improving continuity of care and patient outcomes. For this paper, we drew on the ACNP-related findings of a scoping review of the literature and key informant interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing. The synthesis revealed that ACNPs are working in a range of clinical settings. While ACNPs are trained at the master's level, there is a gap in specialty education for ACNPs. Important barriers to the full integration of ACNP roles into the Canadian healthcare system include lack of full utilization of role components, limitations to scope of practice, inconsistent team acceptance and funding issues. Facilitators to ACNP role implementation include clear communication about the role, with messages tailored to the specific information needs of various stakeholder groups; supportive leadership of healthcare managers; and stable and predictable funding. The status of ACNP roles continues to evolve across Canada. Ongoing leadership and continuing research are required to enhance the integration of these roles into our healthcare system.","468":"Primary healthcare nurse practitioners (PHCNPs), also known as family or all-ages nurse practitioners, are the fastest growing advanced practice nursing role in Canada. All 10 provinces and three territories now have legislation that authorizes their role. Their introduction is linked to countrywide health reform efforts to improve the accessibility and quality of primary healthcare.","469":"This timely paper provides a thought-provoking analysis of current advanced practice nursing education in Canada. It comes at a critical juncture in the evolution of Canadian healthcare services and the redefinition of nursing roles. Increasingly, multiple sectors of society are calling for more nurses with advanced practice preparation and for a wider range of advanced practice nursing specialties. Advanced practice nurses (APNs) are being proposed as a solution to a financially overburdened national healthcare system, the increasing complexity of healthcare services, and a crisis in access to primary healthcare. Thus, governments seeking greater fiscal efficiency, medical specialists needing sophisticated collaborative support, and healthcare consumers see APNs as the way forward.","470":"In Canada, education programs for the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and nurse practitioner (NP) roles began 40 years ago. NP programs are offered in almost all provinces. Education for the CNS role has occurred through graduate nursing programs generically defined as providing preparation for advanced nursing practice. For this paper, we drew on pertinent sections of a scoping review of the literature and key informant interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing to describe the following: (1) history of advanced practice nursing education in Canada, (2) current status of advanced practice nursing education in Canada, (3) curriculum issues, (4) interprofessional education, (5) resources for education and (6) continuing education. Although national frameworks defining advanced nursing practice and NP competencies provide some direction for education programs, Canada does not have countrywide standards of education for either the NP or CNS role. Inconsistency in the educational requirements for primary healthcare NPs continues to cause significant problems and interferes with inter-jurisdictional licensing portability. For both CNSs and NPs, there can be a mismatch between a generalized education and specialized practice. The value of interprofessional education in facilitating effective teamwork is emphasized. Recommendations for future directions for advanced practice nursing education are offered.","471":"Advanced practice nursing has evolved over the years to become recognized today as an important and growing trend among healthcare systems worldwide. To understand the development and current status of advanced practice nursing within a Canadian context, it is important to explore its historical roots and influences. The purpose of this paper is to provide a historical overview of the major influences on the development of advanced practice nursing roles that exist in Canada today, those roles being the nurse practitioner and the clinical nurse specialist. Using a scoping review and qualitative interviews, data were summarized according to three distinct time periods related to the development of advanced practice nursing. They are the early beginnings; the first formal wave, between the mid 1960s and mid 1980s; and the second wave, beginning in the late 1980s and continuing to the present. This paper highlights how advanced practice nursing roles have evolved over the years to meet emerging needs within the Canadian healthcare system. A number of influential factors have both facilitated and hindered the development of the roles, despite strong evidence to support their effectiveness. Given the progress over the past few decades, the future of advanced practice nursing within the Canadian healthcare system is promising.","472":"The objective of this decision support synthesis was to identify and review published and grey literature and to conduct stakeholder interviews to (1) describe the distinguishing characteristics of clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and nurse practitioner (NP) role definitions and competencies relevant to Canadian contexts, (2) identify the key barriers and facilitators for the effective development and utilization of CNS and NP roles and (3) inform the development of evidence-based recommendations for the individual, organizational and system supports required to better integrate CNS and NP roles into the Canadian healthcare system and advance the delivery of nursing and patient care services in Canada. Four types of advanced practice nurses (APNs) were the focus: CNSs, primary healthcare nurse practitioners (PHCNPs), acute care nurse practitioners (ACNPs) and a blended CNS\/NP role. We worked with a multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional advisory board that helped identify documents and key informant interviewees, develop interview questions and formulate implications from our findings. We included 468 published and unpublished English- and French-language papers in a scoping review of the literature. We conducted interviews in English and French with 62 Canadian and international key informants (APNs, healthcare administrators, policy makers, nursing regulators, educators, physicians and other team members). We conducted four focus groups with a total of 19 APNs, educators, administrators and policy makers. A multidisciplinary roundtable convened by the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation formulated evidence-informed policy and practice recommendations based on the synthesis findings. This paper forms the foundation for this special issue, which contains 10 papers summarizing different dimensions of our synthesis.

A philosophical match and work context facilitated this collaboration. Partners acknowledged that continued maintenance of the partnership, or its termination, was dependent on the acceptance of principles of partnership engagement. Even though the common philosophy of primary healthcare brought these partners together and reciprocal capacity building was the glue that nurtured their partnership, the tensions that arose fuelled its continued growth and development. Roles and responsibilities of members were discerned and space was created to acknowledge and integrate the lessons learned when tensions were examined. Within this environmental context, a model of partnership emerged. Tensions within this model were accepted as opportunities that resulted in beliefs being challenged, relevant questions generated and partnership alliances strengthened. In this spiral process, new relevant knowledge was constructed and new norms for best practice and policy were developed. The utility of this inter-professional Partnership Model: Living Inventory of Engagement is demonstrated through case examples.","477":"This paper describes the results of a Delphi panel process to gain consensus on a role description and competency framework for family practice registered nurses (FP-RNs) in Ontario. Based on the findings from interviews and focus groups with family practice registered nurses and their inter-professional colleagues throughout Ontario, a core competency framework for FP-RNs emerged consisting of six distinct roles - Professional, Expert, Communicator, Synergist, Health Educator and Lifelong Learner - with accompanying enabling competency statements. This framework was refined and validated by a panel of experts from various nursing and family medicine associations and organizations through a Delphi consensus process. This core competency framework for FP-RNs was developed as a stepping stone for clarifying this very important and poorly understood role in family practice. As a result of this research, we expect a greater acknowledgement of the contributions and expertise of the FP-RN as well as the need to celebrate and profile this role. This work has already led to the establishment of a network of stakeholders from nursing organizations in Ontario who are considering opportunities to move the development and use of the competency framework forward.","478":"The vast devastation caused by both the First World War and the influenza pandemic of 1918 led to an increased worldwide demand for public health nurses. In response to this demand, a number of new public health training programs for nurses were started at both national and international levels. At the international level, one of two influential programs in this area included a year-long public health nursing course offered by the League of Red Cross Societies, in conjunction with Bedford College in London, England. In total, 341 nurses from 49 different countries have been documented as participants in this initiative throughout the interwar period, including 20 Canadians. Using archival material from the Canadian Nurses Association and the Royal College of Nursing, as well as articles from the journals Canadian Nurse, American Journal of Nursing and British Journal of Nursing, this paper examines these nurses' commitment to internationalism throughout their careers and explores the effect of this commitment on the development of nursing education and professionalization at the national level.","479":"","480":"","481":"","482":"","483":"","484":"","485":"","486":"","487":"Measuring patient outcomes to assess quality and to support evidence-based decision-making has gained momentum over the last two decades. In Ontario, the Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care (HOBIC) initiative has become a part of the province's Information Management Strategy as a way to demonstrate the impact of nursing care on health outcomes. In fall 2006, HOBIC implementation began in early adopter sites with the goal of sharing lessons learned with other healthcare providers and organizations. This action learning study was undertaken in one of the early adopter sites to gain a greater understanding of the factors that support, or fail to support, the integration of HOBIC into professional practice. Participants reported a lack of confidence using HOBIC that they attributed to scarce resources for ongoing education and support. Together, we developed a simulation workshop aimed at enhancing communication skills to achieve more meaningful nurse-patient interaction during the HOBIC assessment. This paper focuses Canadian nurse leaders' attention on the reality that implementing HOBIC is far from straightforward. The real challenge in HOBIC implementation is not mastery of the technology per se, but support for nurses and their ability to adapt daily practice in order to maximize its functionality. ","488":"In this paper we argue that nurse leaders need to work actively to create morally supportive environments for nurses in Canada that provide adequate room to exercise conscientious objection. Morally supportive environments engender a safe atmosphere to engage in open dialogue and action regarding conflict of conscience. The CNA's 2008 Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses has recognized the importance of conscientious objection in nursing and has created key guidelines for the registered nurse to follow when a conflict in conscience is being considered or declared. Nurse leaders need to further develop the understanding of conflicts of conscience through education, well-written guidelines for conscientious objection in workplaces and engagement in research to uncover underlying barriers to the enactment of conscientious objections. With advancements in technology, changing healthcare policies and increasing scope of practice, both reflection and dialogue on conscientious objection are critical for the continuing moral development of nurses in Canada. ","489":"Recruitment and retention of registered nurses is a critical issue facing nursing leaders. Global shortages of nurses have been projected over the next decade. This study used the theoretical framework of push and pull factors to identify influences on nurses' decision to select work in either their home community or a cross-border community, when that opportunity was available to them. Registered nurses living along the southwest border of Ontario were identified with the assistance of the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) and surveyed to determine the factors that influenced their decision to work in Canada or the United States, as well as their intent to remain in their current workplace. Measures included demographic information, reasons for selection of employment, and work environment factors relating to nurses' jobs, work relationships, scheduling\/staffing, workload and attachment to their current place of employment. MANCOVA was used to examine differences between the two groups controlling for age, organizational tenure and employment status. Full-time employment was the greatest push factor identified by RNs, and nurses working in the United States were also more satisfied with the pull factors of development opportunities, relationships with physicians and supervisors, and scheduling congruence. Recommendations for recruitment and retention are discussed. ","490":"Canada's first nurse practitioner-led clinic opened in 2007 after a period of intense lobbying. The development of this clinic has received a great deal of attention in the nursing world and among the general public, but the factors that enabled it have not been examined. The antecedents outlined in healthcare innovation concept analysis - including leadership, financial considerations, idea generation, teamwork, culture and demand - provide a framework for examination of the campaign for the nurse practitioner-led clinic. This review demonstrates the complex interplay of factors that drive healthcare innovation and expands understanding of the leadership and change competencies of the advanced practice nurse. ","491":"The Canadian healthcare system is increasingly complex and more difficult to manage with each passing decade - a situation compounded by near-constant change in health authority structures, interprofessional teamwork and conflict, the actions and decisions of senior administrators and government officials, changing public demographics and consumer expectations of the healthcare system, and the implementation of new knowledge, evidence and innovation. Through these changes - or despite them - nurses remain the largest group of healthcare providers at the interface of the healthcare system and the patient\/client. Nurses must continue working with individuals and families to improve health outcomes while managing through systems changes and translating them into everyday work settings for themselves and their clients. ","492":"The paper \"Working in Canada or the United States: Perceptions of Canadian Nurses Living in a Border Community\" by Cameron, Armstrong-Stassen, Rajacich and Freeman sheds new light on the recruitment and retention factors that influence the reasons nurses select certain work environments. In a border city where Canadian nurses have a choice between working in the United States or Canada, the researchers found that full-time employment was the most important factor attracting nurses to specific institutions, followed by educational opportunities, relationships with physicians and supervisors, and scheduling that is compatible with the nurse's lifestyle. While these employment factors have been identified in the past, the research reminds us of the importance of focusing on the elements that attract nurses to specific healthcare institutions and encourage them to remain, as well as the relative importance of these factors. ","493":"","494":"This research examined leadership attributes that support the optimal utilization and practice of community health nurses (CHNs). Community health nursing is facing challenges in workforce capacity and sustainability. To meet current and future demands on the community sector, it is essential to understand workplace attributes that facilitate effective utilization of existing human resources and recruitment of new nurses. This pan-Canadian, mixed-methods study included a demographic analysis of CHNs in Canada, a survey involving responses from approximately 6,700 CHNs to identify enablers and barriers to community health nursing practice and 23 focus groups to examine organizational attributes that \"best\" support optimal practice within the public health nursing subsector. Nursing leadership was identified as an important attribute in organizations' utilization and support of CHNs working to work effectively. This effectiveness, in turn, will enhance community health programs and overall healthcare system efficiency. This paper highlights findings related to the role of nursing leadership and leadership development in optimizing community health nursing practice.","495":"This paper describes the conceptual structure and organizational framework of the Educator Pathway Project (EPP), which is a unique collaborative capacity-building project creating infrastructure for integrating nursing practice learning and development throughout the service and education sectors in British Columbia. Since 2005, two major health authorities, two universities and the provincial nurses' bargaining association have been engaged in an intensive and dynamic partnership to conceptualize and fundamentally change intersectoral directions and possibilities. This unique initiative has required considerable investment and commitment among all partner organizations, resulting in a clear, shared vision of systemwide support of nursing. With the EPP now in its final year of funding, we are beginning to document its elements and interpret its significant impact on nurses and their workplaces across the regions. In this paper, we describe the overall program design, explain the collaborative partnership mechanisms through which we have been implementing the project and articulate a range of processes through which we are working together to enact significant system-level adjustments aimed at a genuine practice-education continuum. As part of sustaining a strong nursing workforce, we believe that nursing practice and education leaders across Canada are ready to employ this kind of creative approach towards realizing our common goals.","496":"Advanced practice nurses (APNs) at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) are pediatric healthcare providers who integrate principles and theories of advanced nursing with specialty knowledge to provide autonomous, independent, accountable, ethical and developmentally appropriate care in complex, often ambiguous and rapidly changing healthcare environments. Caring for children and adolescents requires culturally sensitive and family-centred approaches to care that incorporate a unique body of knowledge. Family-centred care is an approach to planning, delivery and evaluation of healthcare that is governed by the establishment of mutually beneficial partnerships among APNs, health professionals and children\/families. The cornerstone of APN practice at SickKids is the recognition of \"family\" as the recipients of care. By valuing and developing relationships with families, APNs promote excellence in healthcare across the care continuum to optimize the child's and family's physical, emotional, social, psychological and spiritual well-being. This paper outlines the evolution of advanced practice nursing at SickKids, beginning with the introduction of APN roles in the 1970s and culminating in the current critical mass of APNs who have been integrated throughout the hospital's infrastructure. We describe the process used to create a common vision and a framework to guide pediatric advanced nursing practice.","497":"As the current nursing shortage intensifies under the weight of an aging population, retention of front-line staff is becoming paramount. Studies have consistently demonstrated that the leadership style of nurse managers plays a significant role to this end. This paper describes some of the challenges that managers encounter in their dealings with the contemporary multigenerational workforce - including the baby boomers, generation X and generation Y (the \"millennials\"). A review of research findings suggests the insufficiency of a single leadership approach to nurse management compared to more tailored generational strategies. Application of the transformational leadership model provides the background and tenets from which solutions are proposed for multigenerational management.","498":"The report \"Tested Solutions for Eliminating Canada's Registered Nursing Shortage\" (Tomblin Murphy et al. 2009) projects a nursing shortage in Canada and offers strategies for eliminating that shortage. Using a population needs-based approach, the report estimates that in the year 2007, the shortage of nurses was 11,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) registered nurses. By 2022, the shortage will grow to almost 60,000 FTE RNs. Strategies proposed by the authors to address the RN shortage include increasing nurses' productivity, reducing annual absenteeism, increasing enrolment and reducing attrition in entry-to-practice education programs, improving the retention of practising RNs and reducing international in-migration of nurses.","499":"","500":"","501":"","502":"","503":"","504":"In 2008, the Ontario Long Term Care Association was awarded funding from HealthForceOntario to assist with its nursing recruitment strategy based on research it had initiated in 2007.

The changing landscape of public health in Canada, such as the introduction of new standards and competencies, presents challenges to leaders orienting staff to public health nursing. The toolkit was designed to provide a standardized general orientation, involving a broad range of public health knowledge and issues. Through the use of technology, a virtual network of public health nurses, educators, managers, senior nurse leaders and nursing professors from various areas of Ontario designed, implemented and evaluated the toolkit. Three modules were developed: foundations of practice (e.g., core competencies, national and provincial standards, public health legislation), the role of the public health nurse, and developing partnerships and relationships. Evaluations demonstrated that the toolkit was useful to new hires adjusting to public health nursing. It has had significant uptake within Canada and is well accepted by public health nursing leaders for use in Ontario's health units.","511":"Despite the growing prevalence and healthcare needs of people living with mental illness, the stigma associated with mental health nursing continues to present challenges to recruiting new nurses to this sector. As a key recruitment strategy, five mental health hospitals and three educational institutions collaborated to develop and pilot an innovative nursing residency program. The purpose of the Mental Health Nursing Residency Program was to dispel myths associated with practising in the sector by promoting mental health as a vibrant specialty and offering a unique opportunity to gain specialized competencies. The program curriculum combines protected clinical time, collaborative learning and mentored clinical practice. Evaluation results show significant benefits to clinical practice and an improved ability to recruit and retain nurses. Nursing leadership was crucial at multiple levels for success. In this paper, we describe our journey in designing and implementing a nursing residency program for other nurse leaders interested in providing a similar program to build on our experience.","512":"University Health Network (UHN) became a demonstration site to test a health human resource planning model to foster inter-organizational collaboration, knowledge transfer and exchange of nurses between an urban academic health science centre and a remote region in northern Ontario. Funding support was provided by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The partnership between UHN, Weeneebayko Health Ahtuskaywin (WHA) and James Bay General Hospital (JBGH) addressed retention, recruitment, professional practice development, planning and succession planning objectives. The primary goal of this partnership was to supply the staffing needs of WHA\/JBGH with UHN nurses at a decreased cost for four- to six-week placement periods. This resulted in a marked decrease in agency use by approximately 40% in the WHA site during the months UHN nurses were practicing in the north, with an overall agency cost savings of $165,000 reported in the pilot year. The project also served as a recruitment and retention strategy for all organizations. It provided an opportunity to practice in new clinical settings and to engage in knowledge transfer experiences and professional development initiatives between remote and urban practice environments. In the pilot year, 37 nurses (30 from UHN and 7 from WHA) participated. They returned to their respective organizations re-energized by the different \"landscape\" of practice experience and toward the nursing profession itself.","513":"Nurses working in the long-term care (LTC) sector face unique workplace stresses, demands and circumstances. Designing approaches to leadership training and other supportive human-resource strategies that reflect the demands of the LTC setting fosters a positive work life for nurses by providing them with the skills and knowledge necessary to lead the care team and to address resident and family issues. Through the St. Joseph's Health Centre Guelph demonstration site project, funded by the Nursing Secretariat of Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the Excelling as a Nurse Leader in Long Term Care training program and the Mentor Team program were developed to address these needs. Evaluation results show that not only have individual nurses benefitted from taking part in these programs, but also that the positive effects were felt in other parts of the LTC home (as reported by Directors of Care). By creating a generally healthier work environment, it is anticipated that these programs will also have a positive effect on recruitment and retention.","514":"Home healthcare nurses often work in isolation and rarely have the opportunity to meet or congregate in one location. As a result, nurse leaders must possess unique leadership skills to supervise and manage a dispersed employee base from a distance. The nature of this dispersed workforce creates an additional challenge in the ability to identify future leaders, facilitate leadership capacity, and enhance skill development to prepare them for future leadership positions. The ALIVE (Actively Leading In Virtual Environments) web-based program was developed to meet the needs of leaders working in virtual environments such as the home healthcare sector. The program, developed through a partnership of three home healthcare agencies, used nursing leaders as content experts to guide program development and as participants in the pilot. Evaluation findings include the identification of key competencies for nursing leaders in the home healthcare sector, development of program learning objectives and participant feedback regarding program content and delivery.","515":"Evidence of acute nursing shortages in urban hospitals has been surfacing since 2000. Further, new graduate nurses account for more than 50% of total nurse turnover in some hospitals and between 35% and 60% of new graduates change workplace during the first year. Critical to organizational success, first line nurse managers must have the knowledge and skills to ensure the accurate projection of nursing resource requirements and to develop proactive recruitment and retention programs that are effective, promote positive nursing socialization, and provide early exposure to the clinical setting. The Nursing Human Resource Planning Best Practice Toolkit project supported the creation of a network of teaching and community hospitals to develop a best practice toolkit in nursing human resource planning targeted at first line nursing managers. The toolkit includes the development of a framework including the conceptual building blocks of planning tools, manager interventions, retention and recruitment and professional practice models. The development of the toolkit involved conducting a review of the literature for best practices in nursing human resource planning, using a mixed method approach to data collection including a survey and extensive interviews of managers and completing a comprehensive scan of human resource practices in the participating organizations. This paper will provide an overview of the process used to develop the toolkit, a description of the toolkit contents and a reflection on the outcomes of the project.","516":"To develop and evaluate a toolkit for Registered Nurse\/Registered Practical Nurse (RN\/RPN) staff mix decision-making based on the College of Nurses of Ontario's practice standard for utilization of RNs and RPNs. Descriptive exploratory. The toolkit was tested in a sample of 2,069 inpatients on 36 medical\/surgical units in five academic and two community acute care hospitals in southern Ontario. Survey and focus group data were used to evaluate the toolkit's psychometric properties, feasibility of use and utility. Results support the validity and reliability of the Patient Care Needs Assessment (PCNA) tool and the consensus-based process for conducting patient care reviews. Review participants valued the consensus approach. There was limited evidence for the validity and utility of the Unit Environmental Profile (UEP) tool. Nursing unit leaders reported confidence in planning unit staff mix ratios based on information generated through application of the toolkit, specifically the PCNA, although they were less clear about how to incorporate environmental data into staff mix decisions. Results confirm that the toolkit consistently measured the constructs that it was intended to measure and was useful in informing RN\/RPN staff mix decision-making. Further refinement and testing of the UEP is required. Future research is needed to evaluate the quality of decisions resulting from the application of the toolkit, illuminate processes for integrating data into decisions and adapt the toolkit for application in other sectors. ","517":"In 2008 the Nursing Secretariat of Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care formed a Nursing Workload Steering Committee to oversee the implementation of three demonstration projects with the objectives: to assess the feasibility of Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care (HOBIC) data as a measure of nursing workload, determine the indicators that best support nurse leaders to measure nursing work and make informed staffing decisions, and develop a model that predicts acute care nursing costs. Three HOBIC scales--activities of daily living (ADLs), continence and fatigue--explained a small amount of the variance in nurse judgment of the amount of nursing time patients require in the first 24 hours of care. Nurses in the study appreciated providing their professional judgment to help estimate the nursing work requirements of patients. The priority and secondary indicators most important for decision-making included medical severity of patients, environmental complexity, nurse experience, patient turnover, nurse-to-patient ratio, cognitive status, infection control, nurse vacancy, predictability of patient types, nursing interventions, patient volumes, co-morbidities, patient self-care abilities, physical and psychosocial functioning, unit type and medical diagnosis. A fairly robust model was developed using existing data sources to estimate nursing input into a patient's costs. The model explained between 69% and 80% of the variation in nursing costs for each patient. In order to effectively measure, plan and cost nursing, we need to determine what nursing is. In the future, recognition of nurses as knowledge workers will require us to consider the many patient and environmental factors that affect the ability of nurses to apply their professional judgment to care for patients. ","518":"Timely access to healthcare services requires the right number, mix and distribution of appropriately educated nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals. In Ontario, as in several other jurisdictions, changing demographics, patterns of health service utilization and an aging workforce have created challenges related to the supply of nurses available now and in the future to deliver quality patient care. From 2006 to 2009, the Nursing Secretariat (NS) of Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (the ministry) undertook a progressive and comprehensive approach to address the issue of nursing supply across the province through the introduction of 17 Nursing Health Human Resources Demonstration Projects (demonstration projects). The demonstration projects initiative has led to the creation of a unique collection of best practices, tools and resources aimed at improving organizational planning capacity. Evaluation of the initiative generated recommendations that may guide the ministry toward policy and program development to foster improved nursing health human resource planning capacity in Ontario healthcare organizations.","519":"","520":"This case study describes an ongoing demonstration project that engages nurses and nurse leaders in decision-making with respect to workload management issues at eight practice sites within British Columbia (two per healthcare sector: acute care, long-term care, community health and community mental health). The primary goal of this project is to promote high-quality practice environments by empowering front-line nurses and their leaders: giving them the means to systematically examine and act upon factors that influence their workloads. Examples from practice sites illustrate tangible benefits from the project.","521":"This paper describes the background, development, implementation and utilization of NursesforTomorrow (N4T), a practical and comprehensive nursing human resources analysis method to capture regional, institutional and patient care unit-specific actual and predicted nurse vacancies, nurse staff characteristics and nurse staffing changes. Reports generated from the process include forecasted shortfalls or surpluses of nurses, percentage of novice nurses, occupancy, sick time, overtime, agency use and other metrics. Readers will benefit from a description of the ways in which the data generated from the nursing resource analysis process are utilized at senior leadership, program and unit levels to support proactive hiring and resource allocation decisions and to predict unit-specific recruitment and retention patterns across multiple healthcare organizations and regions.","522":"The Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada has developed an innovative Interprofessional Education Program to help tomorrow's healthcare professionals gain the skills and knowledge they need to work effectively in teams to provide efficient, collaborative and family-centred care. Undergraduate students in nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy participated in group discussions, seminars by staff members and group presentations. Students reported increased understanding of their own and others' roles and a more holistic view of patients and families, and demonstrated their ability to work in teams to create collaborative care plans. Facilitating factors were a strong existing interprofessional team, administrative buy-in and support, consistent clinical nurse specialist involvement and strong, enthusiastic students. Challenges included logistics, time taken away from students' regular clinical time, time required of staff for program planning and implementation, and the difficulty of evaluating effects on patient care. The program shows promise as a way of introducing students to interprofessional practice and giving them a chance to practise their newly acquired skills in a clinical setting. It also has the potential to enhance staff awareness of interprofessional issues and facilitate staff development.","523":"The term professional failure to thrive arose from descriptions of non-organic failure to thrive in infants and observations of nurses' behaviours. First coined by Stamler in 1997, subsequent unrelated research results have supported the theoretical construct. In an era when patient safety and high-quality care have never been more important, and nursing retention has reached heretofore unknown levels of global concern, critical examination of factors that may alleviate professional issues and support high-quality healthcare is especially useful. In this paper, we suggest theoretical causes for professional failure to thrive (PFTT) and associated behaviours exhibited by nurses, and draw links to current research to support the theory. Given the theoretical support, PFTT represents an additional avenue that should be considered and explored through research studies.","524":"We had the privilege of joining over 5,000 nurses attending the 24th Congress of the International Council of Nurses, held for the first time on the African continent in Durban, South Africa. The Congress inspired us to reflect on how leadership and policy directions in Canadian nursing resonate with global health challenges and opportunities. Dynamic plenary speakers from African countries inspired the conference theme: Leading Change--Building Healthy Nations. Ensuing discussions signalled shifting priorities and urgent implications for nursing leadership and programs of research in Canada and worldwide, in areas of primary healthcare renewal, nursing health human resources sustainability and health interventions for the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (United Nations 2009; WHO 2008). Sharing challenges with nurses worldwide, Canadian nurses are privileged with the resources to address these challenges (CNA 2008; WHO 2008). Our experience at the Congress prompted the question: How must Canadian nurses reshape leadership priorities and agendas not only in the Canadian context, but also in the mutual interests of health for all? Reflecting upon the themes of the Congress and the leadership role of Canadian nurses, we identify three interconnected priorities: Invest our hearts, souls and resources in primary healthcare renewal. Grapple with the complexity of an equitable and sustainable global nursing human resources system. Ensure a lens of social justice through leadership, research and education for the achievement of the MDGs.","525":"","526":"In Quebec, as in the rest of Canada, the increasing service demands placed on emergency departments (EDs), and the dwindling resources of physicians, nurses and trainees, have obliged those managing EDs to question whether new roles need to be introduced. Increasing acuity and complexity of care, coupled with rising numbers of pediatric patients seeking care for non-urgent health issues, have created a need to address long waiting times for non-urgent patients, as well as more standardized care (using approved and evidence-based protocols) for acutely ill patients during their ED stay. Presently, the nurse practitioner (NP) role may be operationalized in Quebec EDs, as recent legislation has cleared the path for its introduction. Some theorists view the development of a new role such as the NP's as a dynamic process of shared conceptualizations (i.e., expectations and conceptions) that help maintain stable interaction. To succeed in introducing the NP role, and to minimize conflict in the post-implementation phase, it is important to understand the conceptualizations of those most closely involved: the stakeholders. Given the lack of Canadian literature on this subject, a qualitative descriptive design was effected to identify stakeholders' conceptualizations of the paediatric emergency nurse practitioner (ENP) role in the early stages of development. Stakeholders described it as a largely clinical role with other responsibilities, including teaching and mentoring, and minimal research responsibilities to ensure a clinical focus. The stakeholders agreed that they must be involved in the role development process, i.e., implementation must not be a top-down initiative. The results of this study support the view that stakeholders have conceptualizations of the role itself and of the role development process, and that these conceptions guide expectations of both the role and the process. It is imperative for those developing new roles to be well informed about stakeholders' conceptualizations during the early planning phase.","527":"The workplace for new graduates must be a constructive learning environment to facilitate their development. Nurse managers need new graduates who can \"hit the ground running.\" Conflict between the needs of new nurses and the realities of the workplace often creates role confusion and tension in new graduates and threatens employers' ability to retain them. As part of a larger study that examined the effectiveness of a new strategy on new nurse retention and workplace integration, we conducted focus groups with new nurses and nurse managers. This paper discusses the perspectives of new nurses on their role transition from graduates to practising professionals and the perspectives of nurse managers on the workplace integration of new nurses. The thematic findings integrate new nurses' perspectives on their needs during role transition with the perspectives of nurse managers in meeting those needs. The discussion includes strategies to facilitate successful transition and integration of new nurses into the workplace within the context of recruitment and retention.","528":"The global nursing shortage and statistics indicating a steady increase in the cancer patient workload suggest that the recruitment and retention of oncology nurses is and will be a serious problem. The purpose of this research study was to examine oncology nursing work environments in Canada and to determine the presence of workplace and professional practice factors. A total of 615 oncology nurses responded to a national survey in 2004. The majority of nurses indicated that positive nurse-physician relations and autonomy in clinical decision-making were factors that contributed to job satisfaction and the desire to remain in oncology nursing. However, the findings identified that nurse staffing, the lack of nursing leadership and inadequate opportunities to participate in policy decisions were areas of concern. Differences in work environment perceptions were seen most often when responses were compared across provincial regions. While the findings support previous research reports that the key to the nursing shortage is attention to nursing work environments, they also emphasize the need for organizations to act now. A follow-up survey was conducted in 2006; analysis of these data will be presented in a future report on nurses' perceptions of their work environments and job satisfaction over time.","529":"The issue of professional regulation of advanced nursing practice is one of the most controversial in the area of nursing regulation today. The controversy affects the roles and scope of advanced practice as well as education requirements. Nurse practitioner (NP) practice is one kind of advanced nursing practice receiving attention currently, with a view to developing consistent educational and regulatory approaches. Consistency is needed to enhance the mobility and flexibility of these important healthcare provider resources in time of shortages. This paper describes how the regulatory body in British Columbia decided to register only three categories of NP: family\/all ages, adult and pediatrics. It describes the state of NP regulation when the work began, the consultation process used in coming to this decision and the principles underlying the decision. Regulators, educators and administrators may benefit from understanding the issues and reasoning presented. Literature to guide this work was lacking, a gap this paper addresses to help inform decision-making in other settings and contexts. Dialogue about this approach may facilitate movement towards consistent approaches to the regulation, education and deployment of NPs in Canada and elsewhere.","530":"This paper stems from findings of a literature review and consultation with key informants to explore nursing best practices in public health with rural and isolated Aboriginal communities. It summarizes background information on population distribution, the impact of colonization on Aboriginal health and the potential benefits for nurses and communities in adopting a partnership approach, rather than risking cultural imposition while applying best practices and knowledge derived from the dominant culture. The authors provide an alternative working definition for best practices in the context of public health nursing with Aboriginal communities based on findings from the literature review and key informant consultations. Findings include three principles for the development and assessment of nursing best practices with isolated Aboriginal communities: use of indigenous frameworks, capacity building and cultural safety. The discussion highlights examples that demonstrate the feasibility and strengths of these three principles across a selection of isolated, rural and national settings. Implications include a call for nursing leaders, managers and policy makers to take up this challenge and support wider dialogue and action to enable nursing practice that supports the efforts of Aboriginal people to improve health and social conditions.","531":"","532":"","533":"","534":"","535":"Within Canada's fast-paced, ever-changing healthcare environment, providers are experiencing difficulty practising according to their professional ethical standards, leading many to experience moral or ethical distress. Limited attention has been paid to improvements in the ethical climate in healthcare settings in research focusing on nurses' workplaces. In this three-year study, we focused on how the ethical climate in healthcare delivery can be improved and how the use of participatory action research methods can lead to continued enhancements and lasting changes in services delivery. Together, we developed strategies for taking action, aimed at improving the quality of the work environment. This action involved both nurses in direct care and those in key leadership positions (CNOs or their equivalents). Through the active participation of those for whom the research-based change was intended, these strategies were tested in various sites across British Columbia and can be used as templates or designs for use in other settings. A key component of the success of the projects and action plans that were created was the integral involvement of nurse leaders through all phases.","536":"Hospital restructuring has resulted in nurse managers' having direct responsibility for a greatly expanded number of units and staff. However, very little research has examined the impact of these larger spans of control on nurse and patient outcomes. This study examined the relationships between leadership style, span of control, nurses' job satisfaction and patient satisfaction, as well as the moderating effect of span of control on the relationship between leadership style and the two outcomes. The study was conducted at seven teaching and community hospitals with a sample of 51 units, 41 nurse managers, 717 nurses and 680 patients. Data analyses included multiple regression and hierarchical linear modelling. The study findings provided support for the theoretical relationships among leadership style, span of control, nurse job satisfaction and patient satisfaction. In addition, the results showed that higher spans of control decreased the positive effects of transformational and transactional leadership styles on job satisfaction and patient satisfaction, and increased the negative effects of management by exception and laissez-faire leadership styles on job satisfaction. Leadership matters, and certain leadership styles, particularly transformational, are better than others. Span of control also matters: the wider the span, the lower the nurses' job satisfaction and patient satisfaction. However, as spans of control increase in size, no leadership style, even transformational, can overcome the negative effects. ","537":"Across practice settings, most nursing care is provided to older adults. Yet most nurses receive limited education to care for older adults, especially those with complex needs. A Knowledge Exchange Institute for Geriatric Nursing Education brought together 31 Canadian nursing faculty members and nursing doctoral students and provided them with tools and resources to enhance teaching and curriculum in baccalaureate nursing programs. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action Process model, participants received usable summaries of the best research evidence about care for older adults and tools to increase the likelihood of successful integration of these resources in their teaching and curriculum. Feedback from participants indicates that their personal goals and the goals of the Knowledge Exchange were met. Through a public interactive wiki, participants and others will continue the process of knowledge exchange to improve nursing education and nursing care for older persons.","538":"A quarter of a century ago, the nursing profession in Canada took a bold step: to establish baccalaureate preparation in nursing as the standard for practice as a registered nurse in Canada. Towards that end, hospital schools of nursing gave way to collaborative programs designed to help hospital and college diploma nursing students make the transition into baccalaureate nursing programs. It is thus paradoxical that, today, the nursing profession in Canada should do anything to jeopardize its goal to have RNs prepared at the baccalaureate level. The purpose of this paper is to focus Canadian nurse leaders' attention on that very possibility, given that some professional nursing organizations in Canada have conceptualized a future RN practice that could result in the emergence of a new kind of healthcare professional and a return to diploma preparation of RNs.","539":"","540":"","541":"Remember the 1990s? In case you don't, there was a major recession and hospitals found themselves squeezed for funds. A movement called \"healthcare reform\" was instituted across Canada to reduce costs and balance budgets. Nurses bore the brunt of the so-called reforms, which resulted in * merging of hospitals and loss of nursing positions; * elimination of nurse managers' positions and expansion of the span of control of those who remained, so that they found themselves managing two to four units and responsible for 100 to 200 nurses; * elimination of RN positions and substitution of licensed practical nurses or non-regulated workers; * replacing full-time RN positions with part-time positions without fringe benefits; * absence of nursing positions for new graduates and nurses who had been displaced, driving them to seek employment in the United States (the majority did not return to Canada); * collapse of the applicant pool to schools of nursing, which took a decade to rebound to pre-reform days (the drop in graduates over several years during this period is in part responsible for the shortage of nurses today); * dramatic loss of job satisfaction by nurses, which has still not recovered; and * a prevalent sense that nurses were disposable and mattered little in the broad healthcare system.","542":"","543":"","544":"Over the past two decades, doctor of nursing practice (DNP) degree programs have grown rapidly in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. The DNP has as its emphasis the preparation of leaders for clinical practice, health policy, administration and clinical research. DNP-prepared nurses are in a prime position to work with nurse researchers and to provide leadership in nursing in a variety of settings. DNP programs prepare nurses for the highest level of practice, while PhD programs will continue to prepare nurse researchers. Both PhD and DNP programs are needed to advance nursing knowledge and provide leadership in healthcare.","545":"Registered nurses (RNs) in Ontario have been asked to work collaboratively with family physicians (FPs) and other healthcare professionals in the family practice setting to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery (OFPN 2005). Yet, little is known about the optimal utilization of the RN's role in family practice. This study builds on recent conversations regarding utilization of the nursing workforce (Oelke et al. 2008) and the nursing role (White et al. 2008) in the acute care setting by presenting perceptions of the role of the RN in an urban academic family practice setting. Interviews were conducted with 23 healthcare professionals of varying disciplines across three interprofessional academic family practice units in a Canadian city. Interviewees were asked about their perception of the RN's role as it relates to interprofessional collaboration (IPC). Our findings suggest that ambiguity surrounds the RN's role in family practice in general and in IPC in particular. Also, an FP's level of trust in an RN was found to be a central theme and an important variable in determining FP-RN collaboration, with higher levels of RN trustworthiness associated with higher levels of FP-RN collaboration. Optimal utilization of the family practice RN requires leadership in clarifying the RN's role in IPC, and why and how trust among IPC members is cultivated and nurtured.","546":"The role of the primary healthcare nurse practitioner (NP-PHC) has a long history in Ontario. In this paper, we describe the evolution of the role with a focus on geographic distribution, a profile of client populations and the services provided by NP-PHCs. Comparisons will be made to findings from previous studies and reports on the NP-PHC role in Ontario. In 2004 and 2005, two-thirds of the nurse practitioners registered with the College of Nurses of Ontario responded to a descriptive self-reporting survey. The data collected revealed that NP-PHCs work throughout the healthcare system, including with underserviced and marginalized populations, in community health centres and in outpatient areas within acute care hospitals. They provide the entire spectrum of primary healthcare services. Barriers to fully enacting the role are related to restrictive legislation that limits NP prescribing and diagnosing, and the ability to work to full scope of practice in hospitals (for example, in emergency departments). Targeted funding has promoted the role throughout the province. However, inadequate and insecure pilot funding continues to be a concern. Findings from this study indicate that policy decisions to support the NP role in rural and remote areas have resulted in expansion of the role across the province. Yet, NPs perceive that legislation has lagged and inhibits their ability to meet patient and health systems needs.","547":"To examine the level of job satisfaction and its association with extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction characteristics among Canadian primary healthcare nurse practitioners (NPs). A descriptive correlational design was used to collect data on NPs' job satisfaction and on the factors that influence their job satisfaction. A convenience sample of licensed Canadian NPs was recruited from established provincial associations and special-interest groups. Data about job satisfaction were collected using two valid and reliable instruments, the Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Survey and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and regression analysis were used to describe the results. The overall job satisfaction for this sample ranged from satisfied to highly satisfied. The elements that had the most influence on overall job satisfaction were the extrinsic category of partnership\/collegiality and the intrinsic category of challenge\/autonomy. These findings were consistent with Herzberg's Dual Factor Theory of Job Satisfaction. The outcomes of this study will serve as a foundation for designing effective human health resource retention and recruitment strategies that will assist in enhancing the implementation and the successful preservation of the NP's role. ","548":"As the nursing shortage becomes an increasingly prominent everyday pressure for practice leaders, the search for quick solutions has intensified. A widespread perception has emerged within the service sector that nursing education is failing to fulfill its responsibility to prepare the next generation of nurses. This perception is escalating tensions between leaders in the education and practice sectors, and creating new barriers towards finding collaborative solutions. Although the \"job ready\/practice ready\" debate between practice and education has been a long-standing undercurrent within nursing, extreme shortages affecting practice sector performance across the country create conditions that fuel heightened distrust and division. In this context, it becomes increasingly important that nursing leaders in education and practice engage in thoughtful and respectful dialogue to ensure that tensions between the two sectors are managed and counterproductive schisms prevented. In this paper, we deconstruct some of the current thinking regarding responsibility for the current problem by describing differences in the distinct cultures and contexts of the practice and education sectors, noting potential \"blind spots\" that interfere with our mutual understanding and encouraging a better-informed, shared responsibility to promote constructive engagement in preparing tomorrow's nursing workforce.","549":"","550":"","551":"On April 9, 2009, the government of British Columbia announced that it was expanding the scope of practice of registered nurses, midwives and naturopathic physicians in the province. From now on, RNs will be able to independently provide a broader range of health services including suturing, tuberculosis screening and managing labour in hospital when the primary care provider is absent. Registered nurses working triage will now be able to immediately order diagnostic ultrasounds and X-rays. Additionally, registered nurses will be able to dispense or administer prescription medications in urgent situations including severe allergic reaction, drug overdose, post-partum bleeding and for communicable disease prevention and management. (British Columbia 2009) It is important to point out that it is RNs, not nurse practitioners, who will have these additional capacities.","552":"","553":"Challenges continue to exist in bridging the safety gap to ensure that consistent, high-quality nursing care is provided based on the best scientific knowledge available. This paper examines findings from nursing research presented at the symposium Advancing Nursing Leadership for a Safer Healthcare System, held in Toronto, Ontario in 2007. Four central themes emerged: (1) place the patient in safety; (2) generate a broader knowledge base on safety across the continuum of care; (3) create a safe culture and healthy work environment to mitigate current threats to patient safety; and (4) advance translation of evidence to practice at the organizational and clinical levels. The aim of this exchange of knowledge was to equip nursing leaders and their decision partners with evidence that can become a catalyst for mobilizing change in practice to address the safety chasm.","554":"The purpose of this study was to test a model exploring the relationships among emotionally intelligent leadership behaviour, workplace empowerment and commitment. A predictive, non-experimental design was used to test the model in a random sample of 300 emergency staff nurses working in Ontario. A path analysis supported the fully mediated hypothesized model (chi(2)=2.3, df=1, p &gt; .05; CFI=.99, IFI=.99, RMSEA=.08). Perceived emotionally intelligent leadership behaviour had a strong direct effect on structural empowerment (beta=.54), which in turn had a strong direct effect on organizational commitment (beta=.61).","555":"The rapidly changing world of healthcare is faced with many challenges, not the least of which is a diminishing workforce. Healthcare organizations must develop multiple strategies, not only to attract and retain employees, but also to ensure that workers are prepared for continuous change in the workplace, are working at their full scope of practice and are committed to, and accountable for, the provision of high-quality care. There is evidence that by creating a healthier workplace, improved patient care will follow. Aligning Healthy Workplace Initiatives with an organization's strategic goals, corporate culture and vision reinforces their importance within the organization. In this paper, we describe an innovative pilot to assess a career development program, one of multiple Healthy Workplace Initiatives taking place at Providence Care in Kingston, Ontario in support of our three strategic goals. The results of the pilot were very encouraging; subsequent success in obtaining funding from HealthForceOntario has allowed the implementation of a sustainable program of career development within the organization. More work is required to evaluate its long-term effectiveness.","556":"Today's globalized economy creates opportunities for health professionals but corresponding challenges for countries facing significant shortages of these professionals. The uneven playing field between developed and developing countries hampers the latter in recruiting and retaining trained professionals to oversee and maintain their health systems. Given the salary differentials and variance in working conditions between developed and developing countries, developing countries may lack the pull factors to keep their nurses and doctors from emigrating. However, many developed countries have made significant investments to address this challenge.","557":"The paper \"Global Nurse Migration: Its Impact on Developing Countries and Prospects for the Future\" by Khaliq, Broyles and Mwachofi explores the global nurse migration experience in developed and developing countries. Nurses choose to migrate from developing countries in response to economic and political instability, and poor salaries and working conditions in their home countries. These factors also interfere with the home countries' capacity to deliver education for health professions and to provide adequate support for a healthcare system. The paper clearly outlines the catastrophic outcomes of nurse migration for developing countries where inadequate numbers of trained and experienced nurses remain to support education and administration. Many well-documented references in the paper report overburdening of the remaining workforce, reduced access to care, increased risk of patient mortality, increased maternal, infant and under-five-year mortality rates, reduced life expectancy, increased incidence of communicable diseases and reduced immunization, all resulting from shortages of health professionals, leading to increased nursing workload and burnout.","558":"The worldwide shortage of nurses, which results from a global undersupply and high attrition rates, affects developed countries in the West the same way as it affects developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The difference lies in the fact that developing countries serve as a readily available source of trained nurses for developed countries in Europe, North America and parts of Oceania. Strong \"pull\" and \"push\" factors favour wealthier nations in the West in their efforts to deal with domestic shortages through overseas recruitment. Thus, the ongoing nursing shortage in developing countries is worsened by a loss of thousands of trained nurses every year to emigration. This paper brings into focus the magnitude of the problem in terms of the number of nurses migrating to and from various countries and its impact on developing countries. The paper also examines some of the ongoing efforts in developing countries to mitigate the problem, and sheds light on the prospects for improvement in the foreseeable future.","559":"At the recent Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses (ACEN) Annual Meeting in November 2008 in Ottawa, I had the privilege and honour of becoming president of this dynamic organization. Founded more than 30 years ago, ACEN represents the voice of senior academic nursing leadership in Canada, helping to set directions for healthcare policy and contributing to the alignment and advancement of the national agendas for nursing practice, education, research and leadership.","560":"Dr. Lynn Nagle, the Senior Nursing Advisor for Canada Health Infoway, writes the column on nursing informatics for this journal. She and I have both been involved in the development and now the implementation of HOBIC (Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care), a province-wide initiative funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care: I am the executive lead and Lynn is the informatics lead. HOBIC seeks to bring online functionality to nurses that supports systematic assessment of patients on eight outcomes upon admission and discharge in acute care, chronic hospital care, long-term care and home care, and quarterly for people in residential settings. There is strong research evidence that nurses make a difference in how well patients do on these outcomes. Nurses can now access the results of their assessments online throughout a patient's stay, compare them to other patients of similar age or gender and begin to set benchmarks for improving these outcomes. Unit managers and chief nursing officers receive an array of monthly reports on the admission and discharge status of patients - information that can also be reviewed on the basis of gender and age group. HOBIC will be a critical component of the electronic health record when it is wholly adopted throughout Ontario.","561":"","562":"In spite of the long history of nurse practitioner practice in primary healthcare, less is known about nurse practitioners in hospital-based environments because until very recently, they have not been included in the extended class registration (nurse practitioner equivalent) with the College of Nurses of Ontario. Recent changes in the regulation of nurse practitioners in Ontario to include adult, paediatric and anaesthesia, indicates that a workforce review of practice profiles is needed to fully understand the depth and breadth of the role within hospital settings. Here, we present information obtained through a descriptive, self-reported survey of all nurse practitioners working in acute care settings who are not currently regulated in the extended class in Ontario. Results suggest wide acceptance of the role is concentrated around academic teaching hospitals. Continued barriers exist related to legislation and regulation as well as understanding and support for the multiple aspects of this role beyond clinical practice. This information may be used by nurse practitioners, nursing leaders and other administrators to position the role in hospital settings for greater impact on patient care. As well, understanding the need for regulatory and legislative changes to support the hospital-based Nurse Practitioner role will enable greater impact on health human resources and healthcare transformation.","563":"Healthcare practitioners make many important ethical decisions in their day-to-day practices. Questions arising in daily practice require practitioners to make prudent, balanced and good decisions, which are most effectively made interpersonally and reflectively. It is commonly assumed that the team-based structure of healthcare delivery can provide practitioners with the support needed to address ethical questions in their practice, especially if the team involves multidisciplinary collaboration. A phenomenological study was conducted in which the impact of the team and the larger organization on practitioners' experiences of dealing with moral challenges was uncovered. Various mental healthcare professionals shared their experiences of ethically challenging situations in their practices and described the ways in which their teammates and supervisors affected how they faced these troubling situations. These findings allow us to see that there is considerable room for healthcare managers, many of whom are nurses, to facilitate supportive, ethical environments for healthcare professionals. An understanding of the essential experience of practising ethically allows for an appreciation of the significance of the team's role in supporting it and enables healthcare managers to target support for ethical healthcare work.","564":"The purpose of this paper is to present a critical analysis of the applied degree in nursing as an alternative to collaborative models of undergraduate education delivery by different post-secondary institutions. The notion of having multiple levels of entry into nursing (Northrup et al. 2004) and the authority of colleges to award degrees in nursing (Skolnik 1994) have important practical implications for the profession. Since there is a paucity of Canadian literature about applied degrees in nursing, this paper will make an important contribution to the field of nursing education. Due to the collaborative partnerships that have emerged in many jurisdictions in order to meet the baccalaureate degree as the entry-to-practice requirement, an analysis of the Applied Degree in Nursing is relevant and timely. The paper provides a brief history of the baccalaureate degree as the entry-to-practice requirement for nursing, along with an overview of the rationale for the baccalaureate degree from regulatory, research, academic and practice perspectives. Through an analysis of the benefits, limitations and implications of the applied degree, we conclude that this new applied baccalaureate challenges nursing's status as an academic discipline.","565":"In many parts of Canada, nursing care is provided by registered nurses (RNs) and licensed\/registered practical nurses (L\/RPNs). The profession, regulatory bodies and employers are struggling to define their similarities and differences in their attempts to ensure patients are receiving the right care by the right care provider. An understanding of the decision making of nurses presents one way of differentiating between their overlapping roles. Nursing decision-making is a complex cognitive process. Assessment occurs and problems are postulated. Possible alternatives, with their risks and benefits, outcomes and likelihood of outcomes are identified. Preferences and values are considered, and an intervention is selected. The best way to implement an intervention is determined, implementation follows and evaluation takes place. In this research, a triangulated design was used to examine and compare the decision-making process of RNs and L\/RPNs. Analysis revealed that nurses consider themselves to be frequently involved in elements that are part of the decision-making process. Nurses attribute the difficulty encountered to the context within which decision making occurs. Differences exist between the RN and L\/RPN in the frequency of their involvement with most of the elements of the process. Differences in difficulty encountered with these elements were less pronounced.","566":"","567":"This article calls upon Canadian nursing leaders to examine the merits and downsides of the new practice doctorate degree - the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). The impetus for the DNP arose from within the American nursing profession in order to address the knowledge and skills needed by advanced practice nurses to work in today's complex healthcare environment. The DNP is the newest practice doctorate degree and in 2015 will be the entry to practice degree required of all new advanced practice nurses in the United States. Advanced practice nurses who will have the practice doctorate include clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and nurse anaesthetists. With the establishment and acceptance of the DNP in the United States, American advanced practice nurses will have a different knowledge base than Canadian advanced practice nurses. The evolution and state of advanced practice nursing in Canada are discussed in this article. Canadian nursing leaders must discuss the DNP, its merits and downsides within the Canadian context and begin to make informed decisions about whether or not the DNP should come to Canada.","568":"In 2003, Hamilton Health Sciences embarked on an initiative to improve and standardize nursing schedules and scheduling practices. The scheduling project was one of several initiatives undertaken by a corporate-wide Nursing Resource Group established to enhance the work environment and patient care and to ensure appropriate utilization of nursing resources across the organization's five hospitals. This article focuses on major activities undertaken in the scheduling initiative. The step-by-step approach described, plus examples of the scheduling resources developed and samples of extended-tour schedules, will all provide insight, potential strategies and practical help for nursing administrators, human resources (HR) personnel and others interested in improving nurse scheduling.","569":"As the health system continues to evolve through the implementation of the electronic health record and other information technology initiatives, it is imperative that governments undergo a paradigm shift and recognize the need for strategic investment in home care (CHCA 2008a:7).","570":"","571":"The British Columbia Nursing Administrative Leadership Institute for First Line Nurse Leaders (BC NLI) is a collaborative partnership among British Columbia's Chief Nursing Officers, the Ministry of Health Nursing Directorate and the University of British Columbia School of Nursing.

The evidence-based curriculum covers universal leadership and management concepts, but it also addresses leadership issues of relevance to nurse leaders in today's complex healthcare environments. The BC NLI is part of a provincial health human resources endeavour to ensure sufficient nursing leaders - for now and in the future. This paper will discuss the development, implementation and evaluation of the BC NLI. Unique aspects of the program, such as its online networking component, will be described, and its role in nursing leadership research will be briefly examined.","572":"Nursing practice in remote northern communities is highly complex, with unique challenges created by isolation, geography and cultural dynamics. This paper, the second of two focusing on the advice offered by nurses interviewed in the national study, The Nature of Nursing Practice in Rural and Remote Canada, considers suggestions from outpost nurses. Their advice to new nurses was: know what you are getting into; consider whether your personal qualities are suited for northern practice; learn to listen and listen to learn; expect a steep learning curve, even if you are experienced; and take action to prevent burnout. Recommendations for educators were to offer programs that prepare nurses for the realities of outpost nursing and provide opportunities for accessible, flexible, relevant continuing education. The outpost nurses in this study counselled administrators to stay in contact with and listen to the perspectives of nurses at the \"grassroots,\" and not merely to fill positions but instead to recruit outpost nurses effectively and remunerate them fairly. The study findings highlighted the multiple interrelated strategies that nurses, educators and administrators can use to optimize practice in remote northern communities.","573":"The sustainability of the rural and remote nursing workforce in Canada is increasingly at issue as the country becomes more urbanized and the nursing workforce ages. In order to support the retention of nurses in rural and remote communities and the recruitment of nurses to these communities, we require a better understanding of what is important to rural and remote nurses themselves. As part of the in-depth interviews conducted within The Nature of Nursing Practice in Rural and Remote Canada, a national research project, registered nurses (RNs) were asked what advice they would have for new nurses, educators, administrators and policy makers. This is the first of two papers describing that advice. It focuses on RNs in acute care, long-term care, home care, community health\/public health and primary care roles in rural and remote communities across the country. The RNs were generous with their advice and gave many rich examples. While they were enthusiastic about their nursing practice and encouraging of other nurses to work in rural settings, they were intent that improvements be made in several key areas: education available to new practitioners and themselves, working conditions for rural and remote nurses, leadership, organizational supports and policies that better support rural and remote practice and communities.","574":"A time-and-motion study was conducted in response to perceptions that the surgical nursing staff at a Montreal hospital was spending an excessive amount of time on non-nursing care. A sample of 30 nurse shifts was observed by trained observers who timed nurses' activities for their entire working shift using a hand-held Personal Digital Assistant. Activities were grouped into four main categories: direct patient care, indirect patient care, non-nursing and personal activities. Break and meal times were excluded from the denominator of total worked hours. A total of 201 working hours were observed, an average of 6 hours, 42 minutes per nurse shift. The mean proportions of each nurse shift spent on the main activity categories were: direct care 32.8%, indirect care 55.7%, non-nursing tasks 9.0% and personal 2.5%. Three activities (communication among health professionals, medication verification\/preparation and documentation) comprised 78.9% of indirect care time. Greater time on indirect care was associated with work on night shifts and on the short-stay surgical unit. Subsequent work reorganization focused on reducing time spent on communication and medications. The authors conclude that time-and-motion studies are a useful method of monitoring appropriate use of nursing staff, and may provide results that assist in restructuring nursing tasks.","575":"Have you ever thought about why - if you do - you read the combination of ingredients found in a particular product? Usually, you want to know what makes something good for you or not; what enhances the palatability of the chosen item; or, sometimes, it's sheer curiosity as to whether you have made a good choice. More often than not, you buy something by virtue of its popularity and market penetration or its personal appeal. The successful launch of a product is frequently linked to creative and targeted marketing. But let's face it, there are times when we throw caution to the wind and simply ignore the caloric, saturated fat, sodium and sugar counts of a chosen product.

Nurse empowerment has been the subject of vigorous discussion in healthcare settings, and has been researched largely through an organizational perspective. In this paper, nurse empowerment is analyzed by drawing upon a critical science approach as an alternative theoretical lens. Power is integral to empowerment, and occurs in the context of relations of power. The author uses the ideas of Michel Foucault to address the different ways in which power relations shape nurses' experiences in the workplace. Foucault conceptualizes power as a form of power that envelops staff nurses and nurse managers and, more specifically, as a set of disciplinary techniques. Rather than discussing power solely as a repressive force, Foucault identifies the productive aspects of power. His analysis of where power resides suggests a thought-provoking approach to staff nurse empowerment that has the potential to change nurses' practice through points of resistance, and thus has implications for improving the quality of nurses' work life.","579":"As care needs continue to increase in complexity in inpatient settings, and nurses' scope of practice evolves to keep pace with these changing demands, it is imperative that nurse leaders ensure nursing care delivery models are well aligned to current realities. Older, traditional models of nursing service may no longer foster safe, effective and efficient care or contribute to job satisfaction and high-quality work life for nurses. This paper describes the Autonomous-Collaborative Care Model and its application in a continuing care setting. This innovative and flexible model fosters autonomy and accountability in nursing practice, reduces duplication in the execution of nursing tasks, enhances effective communication and outlines mechanisms for collaboration among various members of the nursing and interprofessional teams. The model has positioned the authors' organization to meet impending shortages of nursing personnel by ensuring that the right category of nurse is assigned to the appropriate patient, by reducing non-nursing work and by supporting nurses' autonomy to practise to their full scope.","580":"Timely access to primary healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult for many Canadians. In a healthcare system created for managing acute illness and communicable disease, the complex care that millions of Canadians with chronic illnesses require is not being appropriately managed. The answer is not more healthcare dollars; it's better use of the funding already allocated. The key to delivering accessible, comprehensive and cost-effective care is effective collaboration among health professionals. The nurse practitioner role offers a unique skill set, incorporating health promotion and disease prevention into primary healthcare, complementing the roles of a variety of other health professionals. In spite of increasing interest and commitment to collaboration, numerous barriers remain. Perceived competition, leadership struggles and confusion about the role have hindered collaboration between nurse practitioners and physicians. Increased interest in interprofessional education has given rise to improved awareness and respect for the knowledge of other disciplines, raising hopes that fostering interdisciplinary working relationships will result in better client care. Nurse practitioners must take the lead in increasing the visibility of their role, improving public understanding and fostering collaborative relationships with other health professionals in order to provide the most effective care for Canadians.","581":"In Canada, collaborative college-university nursing programs have emerged in response to professional education changes and nursing shortages. Developing a collaborative nursing education program between two provinces, each with a distinct academic culture, independent practice, unique governance and separate administration, was not an easy undertaking. The authors used a theoretical approach to implement a collaborative nursing program. Integrating leadership theory with an existing framework for multiple interventions from community health, the authors articulate developmental stages for collaborative education and share their own collaborative journey. This case study demonstrates that healthy, sustainable collaborative education does exist. The paper introduces a developmental model for collaborative education and serves as both a pathway for new collaborations and a reflective tool for existing ones.","582":"","583":"","584":"","585":"","586":"The interrelatedness of nurses' career commitment and job performance is debated. In nursing, few studies have focused on the relationship between the two concepts. A convenience sample of 640 registered nurses (RNs) from 24 hospitals was recruited. A comparative design was used to assess differences among governmental, teaching and private hospitals in regard to the concepts measured. In general, nurses were found to \"agree\" that they had a lifelong commitment to their careers, and that they were performing \"well\" their jobs in accordance with standards. Hospitals in the sample differed in most demographics except in gender, areas of work and decision-making styles. Based on the total scores of nurses' career commitment, there were no significant differences across hospitals. Based on the total scores of nurses' job performance, F-tests indicated some differences; the highest mean was at private hospitals. Using dimensional means of nurses' job performance uncovered no significant differences among hospitals. Individual items of nurses' job performance subscales differed, in some cases significantly, particularly for nurses working at private hospitals: nurses' career commitment was correlated positively and significantly with their job performance. Consistent with the current researchers' hypothesis, nurses' career commitment appears to influence job performance and is influenced by the nurses' characteristics and organizational factors in the workplace. Enhancing nurses' career commitment and their job performance should produce positive outcomes for nurses, patients and organizations.","587":"Several reports have highlighted the need to address underutilization of health human resources, but barriers to and facilitators of role optimization for nurses are poorly understood. The purpose in this study was to understand the perceptions of nurses - Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), Registered Nurses (RNs) and Registered Psychiatric Nurses (RPNs) - of the extent to which they can work to full scope of practice and identify barriers and facilitators in optimizing their roles. As part of a mixed-methods study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 167 acute care nurses (RNs, LPNs, RPNs and nurse managers) in three western Canadian health regions. Approximately 48% of all nurses interviewed felt they were working to full scope, at least some of the time. Barriers to working to full scope included heavy workload, high patient acuity, lack of time, poor communication and ineffective teamwork. Identified facilitators were working as a team, management and leadership support and support for continuing education. Barriers need to be addressed in light of nursing shortages, as these are closely related to job satisfaction and directly affect the retention and recruitment of all groups of nurses. Policies and strategies based on these findings must be developed to ensure that nurses can work to their full scope of practice.","588":"The nursing workforce is faced with shortages of near crisis proportions, yet little is understood about the optimal utilization of various categories of nurses - Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), Registered Nurses (RNs) and Registered Psychiatric Nurses (RPNs). The primary purpose in this study was to elicit the perceptions of nurses (RNs, LPNs, and RPNs) of what \"working to full scope of practice\" meant to them. Participants included acute care nurses in three health regions in western Canada. A key finding from the study was the fact that nurses most often discussed scope of practice by reference to the tasks they perform, rather than the roles they play in healthcare delivery. Assessment and coordination of care were two components of nursing work that most differentiated the three nursing roles. Nonetheless, insufficient role differentiation among nurses and between nurses and other healthcare professionals leaves some nurses feeling devalued and not respected for their contribution to healthcare delivery.","589":"Launching one's career as an independent researcher can be a difficult task, especially without formal training or mentorship beyond doctoral studies. Post-doctoral training offers opportunities to further develop, refine and broaden one's repertoire of research skills.

A feminist philosophy guided this qualitative study, conducted in New Brunswick, to gain an in-depth knowledge of the impact of restructuring on nurses working in all types of healthcare facilities across the province. Sixty-five nurses were interviewed, and a number of themes, including \"having a voice,\" emerged from the data. While many of the nurses interviewed reported that they were not invited to participate in decisions related to healthcare restructuring, others noted that when they did have an opportunity to participate, they were frequently not heard. However, a number of nurses also reported that they believed they had some influence and could continue to make a positive difference when they were asked to be involved at the outset of a change process.","595":"This paper reports on a graduate follow-up of the outcomes of participation in an honours BScN program, two to seven years post-graduation. It compares two groups of graduates with high GPA scores, both initially eligible to complete the honours program.

In phase 1 of the study, a self-administered mailed questionnaire was sent to participants to assess their involvement in research activities, occupancy of leadership positions, enrollment in graduate studies and demonstration of liberal education competencies in their professional lives after graduation. In phase two, personal interviews were held with a purposive subsample of participants to explore early career workplace experiences with research-based activities and participants' perceptions of factors influencing their decision to complete or not to complete the honours program.

Secondary analysis of qualitative and quantitative data collected in the post-intervention phase of the study entitled Evaluation of the Dissemination and Utilization of Best Practice Guidelines by Registered Nurses in Ontario. Eleven agencies across Ontario, Canada. Fifty nursing staff, 32 nurse administrators and 22 clinical resource nurses (90% response) participated in semi-structured interviews. A total of 316 randomly selected nursing staff from 23 participating units in 11 agencies completed questionnaires (65% response). Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews were examined to determine whether participants had modified their policies and procedures as part of the implementation of clinical guidelines. Using SPSS 11.0 for Windows, the authors assessed, using independent t-tests, the relationship between the perception of modification of policies and procedures and the perceptions of organizational support an organisational stability. While modifications to policies and procedures were made at each agency as part of the implementation of clinical guidelines, 27% of staff disagreed that modifications had been made. Nursing staff who agreed that changes had been made to policies and procedures were significantly more likely to report positive organizational support for clinical guideline implementation. Findings suggest the need to increase nursing staffs' awareness of changes to policies and procedures during clinical guideline implementation. Furthermore, results indicate that organizational support may have a positive influence on modifications to policies and procedures that are guided by research-based clinical guideline recommendations. ","597":"Social and economic changes in industrial societies during the past quarter-century encouraged organizations to develop greater flexibility in their employment systems in order to adapt to organizational restructuring and labour market shifts (Kallenberg 2003). During the 1990s this trend became evident in healthcare organizations. Before healthcare restructuring, employment in the acute hospital sector was more stable, with higher levels of full-time staff. However, in the downsizing era, employers favoured more flexible, contingent workforces (Zeytinoglu 1999). As healthcare systems evolved, staffing patterns became more chaotic and predicting staffing requirements more complex. Increased use of casual and part-time staff, overtime and agency nurses, as well as alterations in skills mix, masked vacancy counts and thus rendered this measurement of nursing demand increasingly difficult. This study explores flexible nurse staffing practices and demonstrates how data such as nurse vacancy statistics, considered in isolation from nurse utilization information, are inaccurate indicators of nursing demand and nurse shortage. It develops an algorithm that provides a standard methodology for improved monitoring and management of nurse utilization data and better quantification of vacancy statistics. Use of standard methodology promotes more accurate measurement of nurse utilization and shortage. Furthermore, it provides a solid base for improved nursing workforce planning, production and management.","598":"Governments across Canada and internationally are implementing nurse telephone advice services to their populations as a means to address healthcare access issues. This paper briefly reviews the international and Canadian history of telephone nursing services and outlines the research that has established the relative safety of these services to patients. The standards, competencies and decision systems that support safe tele-practice are reviewed. The paper focuses on the realities of this emerging nursing practice. A number of concerns related to the marriage of clinical practice and call centres are identified that require further dialogue, research and debate within the profession. The call centre environment can lead to a focus on efficiency measures, such as call length and quick turnaround to the next call, without evidence to ensure that these are safe or desirable standards. Quality of work life for staff in call centres is also raised as an issue that requires more research and dialogue. Other issues include cross-jurisdictional licensure, patient safety, privatization and the differing models of telephone nursing services that are being implemented in Canada.","599":"","600":"","601":"","602":"","603":"","604":"","605":"","606":"It is now understood that successful implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) requires a focus on the context of the care setting.

The existing university curriculum, which used a problem-based, small-group and student-centred approach, was implemented at all three sites. Considerable adjustments were required by faculty as they adapted to a collaborative approach in implementing this nursing curriculum. Q-methodology was used to identify nursing faculty viewpoints about the collaborative program experience. Sixty-one participants from the three sites completed a 50-item Q-sort representing their statements about collaboration. Data were analyzed using PQMethod version 2.11. Six salient viewpoints were identified: Champions of Collaboration, Proponents of Scholarship and Clinical, Critics of Collaboration, Defenders of McMaster Curriculum, Acceptors of Collaboration and Detractors of the Partnership. On the whole, the collaboration has been a success and a spirit of cooperation prevails. However, a number of faculty issues were identified that should be addressed. The results will be of value to other collaborative nursing programs as they work together to foster faculty commitment and collegiality.","608":"The provision of care for frail older adults in Long-term care settings is challenging. It requires not only specialized knowledge and skills, but also supportive commitment on the part of directors of care to their nurse supervisors (registered nurses and registered practical nurses) and unregulated healthcare staff. In these complex work environments, communication and leadership are critical to staff job satisfaction. Therefore, it is essential that directors of care represent a source of support for their nurse supervisors. The purpose of this multi-site study was to examine the relationships among perceived support from directors of care, and nurse supervisors' job stress and job satisfaction. Forty-five per cent of the total variance in job satisfaction of nurse supervisors was explained by supervisory support, stress and job category (registered nurse vs. registered practical nurse). Greater supervisory support was also associated with reduced job stress. These findings are essential in developing strategies to improve the nurse supervisory role in long-term care settings.","609":"As leaders for nursing education, nursing research, healthcare administration and patient safety, we asked one another: How do we use our collective resources to build health system capacity for clinically based research training and safer healthcare? Drawing on knowledge from the field of ecological restoration, which is the study and repair of damaged ecosystems, we partnered the Safer Systems research program of the Faculty of Nursing, University of Alberta, with Capital Health's Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH), the Caritas Health Group, the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI) and several funding agencies to provide hands-on training in clinical research, infection control and patient safety policy development for nursing students during the summer months. As we plan ahead, our student and staff evaluations show that together, we can make concrete, vital contributions to student education, nursing research, evidence-informed practice, clinical quality improvement and national policy. We are using what we have learned to continually expand the range of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral clinical learning opportunities in healthcare safety that are available year round. Our shared goal is to support current and future nurses in leading the way for safer healthcare systems and the safest possible healthcare.","610":"","611":"","612":"There is presently an initiative in Canada to promote the role and implementation of nurse practitioners. Nurse practitioners have the ability to help close major gaps in our present healthcare system and thus improve healthcare services for Canadians. Answering the needs of our chronically ill population may be one of those gaps. Currently, only a small percentage of Canadian patients living with heart failure and their families are receiving the services that have proven effective in randomized trials. The addition of nurse practitioners in heart failure management outpatient clinics would improve the link between clinical research and practice, ensuring that the services patients receive are based on the evidence that is currently available.","613":"This position paper will: 1. Provide an update on relevant current developments in the education, training and positioning of clinician nurse scientists; 2.

APNs caring for adult, paediatric or palliative patients in integrated regional cancer programs, tertiary care hospitals or community hospitals and agencies were invited to complete a mailed self-report questionnaire. A total of 73 of 77 APNs participated in the study. Most APNs (55%) were acute care nurse practitioners employed by regional cancer programs or tertiary care hospitals. Adult patients with breast or haematological cancers and those receiving initial treatment or palliative care were the primary focus of APN roles. APN education needs related to specialization in oncology, leadership and research were identified. Overall, APNs were minimally satisfied with their roles. Role confidence (beta = .404, p = .001) and the number of overtime hours (beta = -.313, p = .008) were respective positive and negative predictors of APN job satisfaction. Progress in role development is described, and recommendations for improving role development and expanding the delivery of oncology APN services are provided.","615":"This paper describes and examines a change program for nursing services in Complex: Continuing\/Long Term Care (CC\/LTC) at the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto. It presents a brief history of the rise of CC\/LTC services and the difficulties associated with them. In particular it claims that demographic, professional and insti tutional changes have produced a differentiated specialization of supports which tend to disregard some necessary aspects of daily support for patients, and devalue the role of direct care workers in these settings. The \"Reconnecting to Care\" (RTC) initiative is a response the to these changes by nurses at Baycrest. In detailing why Baycrest has decided to get back to basics and reconnect to care and how it has begun to do this, this paper provides an overview of the reasons for this initiative, a little of how it has been implemented so far, and some initial lessons for nursing leaders and others.","616":"","617":"","618":"","619":"","620":"","621":"To understand factors that affect the implementation of medical directives by registered nurses in a large teaching hospital. Qualitative nested case study. A large multi-site teaching hospital that utilizes over 20 different medical directives was chosen as the setting for this case study. Three distinct medical directives within this setting were selected to obtain maximum variation in the number of individuals involved in a particular directive and type of clinical area. Between March and October 2005, 27 individuals concerned with clinical implementation of these medical directives were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. The registrars of two regulatory bodies that oversee policies related to medical directives and a consultant with expertise in medical directives were also interviewed. Eleven documents related to the use of medical directives were identified using purposive document sampling methods and were included in the study. Implementation of medical directives is influenced by a variety of factors, including nurse confidence and willingness to assume responsibility, the amount of new learning needed to carry out the directive and additional paperwork required. Perceived usefulness of the medical directive, physician support of nurses' use of the directives and frequency of encounter with that type of patient were also important factors. The implementation of a medical directive is a complex process; directives are difficult to write well and often affect the scope of practice of other healthcare professionals. The amount of education and monitoring required to implement a directive needs careful consideration to ensure the appropriate resources are available to support implementation. Greater attention to the factors that facilitate implementation of medical directives is required in order to implement directives in an efficient and effective manner. ","622":"Professional practice leader (PPL) roles have been a common part of the healthcare Landscape for several years, yet the manner in which the role is operationalized varies significantly. This variability leads to ambiguity about the role, its purpose and the value added to the profession, the organization and the healthcare system. Some ambiguity may be due to the lack of a theoretical framework as a foundation for the role. In this climate of evidence-based practice, nursing leaders must demonstrate the rationale for innovations such as the PPL role. The focus of this paper will be to contextualize the PPL role within Kanter's Theory of Structural Empowerment in order to provide a common language for the various stages of evolution of the PPL role (i.e., design, implementation and evaluation). A content analysis of existing PPL role descriptions in Ontario will be used to demonstrate the applicability of Kanter's theory to the PPL role. This paper will be of interest to nursing Leaders and professional practice leaders as an example of how theory can provide direction and support to the operationalization of professional practice roles, functions and outcomes.","623":"Generational differences in values, expectations and perceptions of work have been proposed as one basis for problems and solutions in recruitment and retention of nurses. This study used a descriptive design. A sample of 8207 registered nurses and registered practical nurses working in Ontario, Canada, acute care hospitals who responded to the Ontario Nurse Survey in 2003 were included in this study. Respondents were categorized as Baby Boomers, Generation X or Generation Y based on their birth year. Differences in responses among these three generations to questions about their own characteristics, employment circumstances, work environment and responses to the work environment were explored. There were statistically significant differences among the generations. Baby Boomers primarily worked full-time day shifts. Gen Y tended to be employed in teaching hospitals; Boomers worked more commonly in community hospitals. Baby Boomers were generally more satisfied with their jobs than Gen X or Gen Y nurses. Gen Y had the largest proportion of nurses with high levels of burnout in the areas of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Baby Boomers had the largest proportion of nurses with low levels of burnout. Nurse managers may be able to capitalize on differences in generational values and needs in designing appropriate interventions to enhance recruitment and retention of nurses.

To do so, they created a pan-Canadian collaborative of 45 experts and asked them to develop an action strategy to improve healthcare workplaces. One of the first steps taken by members of the collaborative was to adopt the following shared belief statements to guide their thinking: \"We believe it is unacceptable to fund, govern, manage, work in or receive care in an unhealthy health workplace,\" and, \"A fundamental way to better healthcare is through healthier healthcare workplaces. This commentary provides an overview of the Quality Worklife-Quality Healthcare Collaborative action strategy.

However, little is known about the key behaviours and activities required to successfully implement and sustain research-based innovations in practice. This study describes the leadership behaviours and activities that influenced nurses' use of clinical practice guidelines. A secondary analysis of qualitative data was conducted to investigate factors that contributed to sustaining (or not) the use of clinical guidelines two and three years after implementation as part of the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario Best Practice Guidelines project. Grounded theory techniques were used to develop a theoretical model of Leadership. Findings indicated a different pattern of leadership in organizations that sustained guidelines, when compared to those that did not. Three broad leadership strategies emerged as central to successfully implementing and sustaining guidelines: (1) facilitating staff to use the guidelines, (2) creating a positive milieu of best practices and (3) influencing organizational structures and processes. Leadership for guideline implementation was found to include such behaviours as support, role-modelling commitment and reinforcing organizational policies and goals consistent with evidence-based care.","631":"Professionalization efforts in nursing have opened up new opportunities for nurses to develop the roles in which they work. One of these roles is advanced nursing practice. However, the development of the advanced roles, with their aims of making an advanced contribution in education, administration, research and practice, results in role overlap and confusion. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that explored the ways in which nursing educators understand, value, utilize and interact with nurses in the advanced practice role. Data were collected among nurse educators and advanced nurse practitioners in an urban, acute care setting. The findings demonstrate how nurses in potentially conflicting roles differentiate themselves and define their job duties. Organizational supports for implementing clear advanced roles are suggested, adding to the knowledge upon which nursing administrators can base their strategic human resources decisions.","632":"Efforts to improve nursing working conditions are critical to retaining nurses currently in the system and attracting newcomers to the profession (Laschinger et al. 2003b). The nurse leader's empowering behaviours can be pivotal in the way nurses react to their work environment. The purpose of this study was to test a model examining the relationship between nurse leaders' empowerment behaviours, perceptions of staff empowerment, areas of work life and work engagement using Kanter's theory of structural power in organizations. A cross-sectional correlational survey design tested the model in a random sample of 322 staff nurses in acute care hospitals across Ontario. Overall, staff nurses perceived their leaders' behaviours to be somewhat empowering and their work environment to be moderately empowering. Fifty-three percent reported severe levels of burnout. Leader empowering behaviour had an indirect effect on emotional exhaustion (burnout) through structural empowerment and overall fit in the six areas of work life. The final model statistics revealed a good fit (chi(2)=30.4, chi=3, chi=0.96, chi=0.95, chi=0.95). These findings suggest that the Leader's empowering behaviours can enhance person-job fit and prevent burnout. These findings have important implications in the current nursing shortage.","633":"Leading change initiatives across multiple geographic locations has become increasingly frequent among nursing leaders as hospitals merge to form more effective and powerful organizations.

Since 2001, the authors have been the key designers and facilitators of the Dorothy Wylie Nursing Leadership Institute (DMW-NLI). The background, key characteristics and benefits of the DMW-NLI have been described in detail elsewhere (Simpson et al. 2002). One of the Institute's key features is that participants bring a change initiative that they wish to pursue and - during their time on site - we assist them in developing that project to the point where it has a strong chance of success. When we incorporated this aspect into the DMW-NLI program, we believed that opportunity to apply the learning of the Institute to a desired initiative in the home setting would add significant value, not only to the participants, but also to their sponsoring organizations. Further, it was our hope that we could develop a methodology to advance the change initiative, which would be a valuable tool that participants could use in future change projects.As we looked to the literature, we found no shortage of articles on change theory, as well as numerous tools and techniques for project management. However, we did not find one single approach or methodology that we felt was comprehensive yet concise enough to serve as a practical guide for those who wish to advance a change initiative in their practice settings today. Therefore, we developed an integrated conceptual framework and methodology for leading change initiatives, building on selected current and classic theories of change that are relevant today. Both the framework and methodology have proven very hardy, and will, we believe, be of interest to nurse leaders and other health professionals in leadership roles. This paper will provide a brief overview of relevant background literature on leading change initiatives, introduce the DMW-NLI Change Leadership conceptual framework, describe a number of activities that support the framework, and conclude with a summary of its impact to date and implications for leaders and managers.","640":"","641":"Retention of health professionals is a serious problem in northern and rural Canada. Magnet hospital factors are known to increase job satisfaction, which contributes to retention. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which magnet hospital characteristics (management support, nurse-doctor and nurse-manager relationships, professional autonomy and responsibility) contribute to northwestern Canadian hospital nurses' job satisfaction. Participants were 123 nurses from 13 hospitals in western Canada. They completed a survey and structured interview that provided data on their attitudes and perspectives about their hospital jobs. We found that some magnet hospital characteristics apply in northern and rural western Canadian hospitals. Our findings indicate that management support and nurse-manager relations are important to nurses' job satisfaction, but participants' views of management were fairly negative, an issue that management needs to address. Nurses' ability to work professionally and autonomously is also important to their satisfaction. There are indications that nursing supervisory skill sets need to be upgraded in some instances.","642":"Medication reconciliation (MR) involves the accurate transfer of medication information across the continuum of care. The aim of this study was to measure nurses perceptions of patient safety, medication safety and current MR practice at transition points in a patient's hospital stay. Surveys were distributed to 111 nursing staff in three general medicine units at Capital Health District, Nova Scotia, in August 2005. A total of 39 nurses (35% response rate) completed the survey. \"Teamwork within units\" was the safety culture dimension with the highest positive response (98.1%), while the processes of handoffs and transitions received the lowest positive response (42.8%). Key areas identified for improvement relative to the current level of MR practice include institutional patient safety systems (e.g., low confidence in existing systems and procedures), inconsistent practices (e.g., wide variation in whether community pharmacists are contacted to verify medication profiles), lack of communication (e.g., between healthcare professionals) and staffing resources (e.g., MR is perceived as a very time-consuming process). Addressing these challenges prior to implementing a formalized MR program should help to ensure success of the project. The insights gained through the use of this survey may prove valuable to other Canadian healthcare organizations that are implementing MR services.","643":"As a large cohort of experienced nurses approaches retirement, it is critical to examine factors that will promote the engagement and empowerment of the newer workforce, allowing them to provide high quality patient care.

More specifically, the relationships among structural empowerment, six areas of work life (conceptualized as antecedents of work engagement), emotional exhaustion and organizational commitment were examined. As predicted, structural empowerment had a direct positive effect on the areas of work life, which in turn had a direct negative effect on emotional exhaustion. Subsequently, emotional exhaustion had a direct negative effect on commitment. Implications of these findings for nursing administrators are discussed.","644":"The Nursing Division of the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST) first included systems and patient safety as a priority in its institutional business and strategic plan in 2003.

Strategies to integrate these concepts into the school's 15 nursing education programs are being implemented.","645":"Nursing-sensitive outcomes provide common information across sectors, thus eliminating duplication that frequently occurs as individuals move across settings. These outcomes also facilitate increased trust among colleagues and support common understandings of patient care needs, thus enhancing continuity of care. Outcomes-oriented information is also likely to increase patient safety and improve overall quality of care. Shared standards and data support consistent decision-making, as nursing decisions can be tracked back over time to assess patient care outcomes. Consequently, nurses will have the means to determine the impact of their interventions on patient outcomes. At the same time, adoption of common approaches to patient assessment leads to greater professional accountability and moves nursing care from a task orientation to an outcomes focus. For administrators, such improvements in monitoring and evaluating patient outcomes translate into improvements in efficiencies and effectiveness, thus providing a return on investment in implementing these outcomes within their agency. For nurses, integration and utilization of outcomes information increases the visibility and significance of their decision-making and patient care. Together with patients, nurses can utilize the outcomes information to make evidence-based decisions and advocate for appropriate care. At an aggregate level, the use of outcomes information creates a continuous feedback loop that is essential to ensuring evidence-based care and the best possible patient outcomes, not only for individuals, but also for families, communities and populations. Outcomes-oriented care provides a gateway for transforming the way we care for patients; puts safe, ethical, high-quality care for patients first; embodies the principles of evidence-based practice; ensures that the value of nursing is clearly understood within the larger system; and ensures that the requirements for measurability and accountability can be achieved. This journey is continuous and is being expanded to engage all other health disciplines in understanding and documenting their contributions to patient care, both as individual practitioners and as members of a healthcare team. Preparing nursing students in an outcomes approach will facilitate systemwide adoption of HOBIC patient outcomes over time and provide a means to determine the impact of nursing care on our patients.","646":"","647":"","648":"","649":"An Undergraduate Nurse Employment Demonstration Project (UNDP) was implemented in four Health Service Areas in British Columbia with a concurrent evaluation study. This demonstration project comprised the development and implementation of a new position in the BC healthcare system. The position enabled third- and fourth-year nursing students to be employed at their level of education. The purposes of the evaluation were to explore the feasibility and outcomes of this type of paid undergraduate student nurse employment. The three-year project and evaluation included both implementation and outcome analysis. The implementation evaluation design was descriptive and prospective, involving multiple data sources. The outcome evaluation design was quasi-experimental, with intervention and comparison groups. Learning outcomes for undergraduate nurses were increased confidence, organizational ability, competency and ability to work with a team. Workplace outcomes were increased unit morale, help with workload and improved patient care. New graduates with undergraduate nurse experience reported less time required for orientation and transition than other graduates who did not have this experience, and workplace nurses viewed these new graduates as more job-ready than other new graduates. After 21 months, new graduates with undergraduate nurse experience were less likely to move to other employment than other new graduates. Results from the four Health Service Areas indicated that the paid undergraduate nurse position was feasible and that outcomes benefited students, new graduates and workplaces. The undergraduate nurse position is now being implemented throughout all Health Service Areas in British Columbia.By 2000, concerns in British Columbia about the nursing workforce, workplace and patient safety had escalated to the point where diverse stakeholder groups were prepared to work together in new ways to prepare nursing graduates to be more job-ready, to recruit and retain new graduates and to retain existing nurses. Stakeholder groups were administrators, labour organizations, professional associations, educators and government. One idea to support job readiness and retention focussed on the feasibility of implementing cooperative education for nursing students. The effort was unsuccessful owing to lack of funding, but resulted in a review of the literature on cooperative education and other work-study programs. Cooperative education connects classroom learning with paid work experience for the purpose of enhancing students' education (Fitt and Heverly 1990; Heinemann and De Falco 1992; Ryder 1987). Reported benefits for students were improved job preparation and graduate retention (Ishida et al. 1998), additional staffing and reduction in orientation time (Cusack 1990; Ishida et al. 1998), increased practice judgment (Cusack 1990; Siedenberg 1989) and better workload management (Ross and Marriner 1985). A work-study model reported in the literature offered benefits similar to those of cooperative education, with greater flexibility in design. An example was the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston's collaborative work-study scholarship program with local hospitals (Kee and Ryser 2001). Students in second clinical semesters were employed as unlicensed personnel by hospitals. The students, as unlicensed personnel, worked to the level of their nursing preparation. Reported benefits for students were academic credit, financial assistance, interaction with multidisciplinary teams, opportunity to refine clinical skills, understanding of nurses' roles and guaranteed interview for positions on graduation (Kee and Ryser 2001). Benefits for practice organizations were skilled help, the opportunity to recruit new nurses and increased interaction with a university nursing program. While nurse education stakeholders in British Columbia were exploring options, the concept of undergraduate student nurse employment was initiated by a group of fourth-year students at the University of Victoria who were completing the course \"Nurses Influencing Change.\" The students were concerned about having enough practice experience to meet increasing nursing competency requirements and their survival as new graduates given workplace realities. Debt load also was a concern because extensive student practicum time limited opportunities for paid employment during the nursing education program. Students found that the idea of paid undergraduate nurse positions, based on the student employment model in Alberta, was supported by nurse leaders, many practising nurses and nursing faculty who also were concerned about meeting patient care standards and adequately preparing nursing students. In 2000, the BC Ministry of Health Services funded an Undergraduate Nurse Demonstration Project (UNDP) - one type of paid employment for undergraduate student nurses - in four Health Service Areas linked with four schools of nursing.

Many activities have been initiated to address the shortage of nurses, including increasing recruitment of students to study nursing. This paper has two major goals: (1) to answer the research question, \"To what extent do college students' characteristics explain the differences in their attitudes towards four service occupations (nursing, medicine, physical therapy and high school teaching)?\" and (2) to demonstrate statistical methods appropriate for performing multivariate analyses of clustered data and merging independent survey items into a clustered, multivariate analysis for direct comparison of the different items. Results indicate that the more favourable rating of nursing as an occupation relative to physical therapy is due to the sample, including a large number of students majoring in nursing. Students who are not nursing majors do not appear to hold a more favourable attitude towards nurses relative to physical therapists. The lower rating of high school teachers and higher rating of physicians on most items persists even after adjusting for all the control variables, including whether or not students are nursing majors. Additionally, results support the need for a statistical method such as generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for individual and interaction confounders, repeated measures, clustering and correlated data.","652":"Knowledge utilization (KU) is an essential component of today's nursing practice and healthcare system. Despite advances in knowledge generation, the gap in knowledge transfer from research to practice continues. KU models have moved beyond factors affecting the individual nurse to a broader perspective that includes the practice environment and the socio-political context. This paper proposes one such theoretical model the Joint Venture Model of Knowledge Utilization (JVMKU). Key components of the JVMKU that emerged from an extensive multidisciplinary review of the literature include leadership, emotional intelligence, person, message, empowered workplace and the socio-political environment. The model has a broad and practical application and is not specific to one type of KU or one population. This paper provides a description of the JVMKU, its development and suggested uses at both local and organizational levels. Nurses in both leadership and point-of-care positions will recognize the concepts identified and will be able to apply this model for KU in their own workplace for assessment of areas requiring strengthening and support.","653":"An essential outcome of professional practice environments is the provision of high-quality, safe nursing care.

Demand is often said to be outstripping capacity, with constant change and retrenchment distinguishing features of the current context. This paper takes a reading of the current conditions of home care using data gathered during a field study of home care case management practices conducted in 2004. As economic discourses become increasingly influential in determining responses to client situations, case managers (and their managers) find themselves with limited capacity to exercise control over their practices. A growing gap between professionally influenced discourses--those presumably intended to guide practice--and organizational priorities creates a dissonance for case managers as the political-ethical dimensions of their practices are displaced by budget \"realities.\" For front-line workers, such displacement cannot be sustained in their face-to-face encounters with clients, leading to a growing sense of frustration and powerlessness among these highly skilled practitioners.","661":"The role that hospital-based nurses should play in the delivery of high-tech home care, and how they should be supported in that role, are topics that remain understudied. Our research objective was to document how hospital-based nursing teams perceive and deal with the clinical and technical challenges associated with the provision of high-tech home care. Four home care interventions were selected: antibiotic intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, peritoneal dialysis and oxygen therapy. A self-administered survey was sent to all hospital-based units providing these interventions in the province of Quebec, Canada (n = 154; response rate: 70.8%). We used descriptive statistical analyses to derive mean values for scores on either a five- or a six-level Likert scale. Despite variation across the four interventions, our results indicate that while nursing teams believe these interventions increase patients' autonomy, they also recognize that they generate anxiety and impose constraints on patients' lives. Nurses must increase efforts to deal with both clinical and technical challenges and help patients overcome the barriers to appropriate use of home care technologies. While nursing teams generally perceive high-tech home care as beneficial, they still experience significant technical and clinical challenges. Some of these challenges could be addressed by strengthening professional training initiatives, while others require broader home care policy interventions.

A qualitative study was undertaken to increase understanding of the clinical nurse specialist role of advanced practice. Sixteen nurses who worked in advanced practice roles, organizing and providing healthcare for children with complex health needs and their families across the continuum of care, participated in in-depth conversations about the nature of their practice, the knowledge that informs it and the factors that influence it. Findings suggest that clinical nurse specialists have a unique role in the organization and delivery of healthcare for specialized populations with complex health needs in their dual focus on the system level of healthcare and on population health needs. Initiatives directed to children and families within the study participants' specialties included program development, consultation and educational outreach and the development of clinical guidelines and policies. Although the nurses described their practice as focusing both on individual children and families and on the population of children and families within their specialty, it is at the population level that they see their greatest potential for contributing to the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective healthcare.","669":"In 2003, over 13,000 Ontario nurses were surveyed to explore how they evaluated their hospital work environments and their responses to these practice environments. The purpose of this paper is to describe and compare these nurses' evaluations and responses. Sixty-five percent of nurses who were mailed surveys completed and returned a survey. Significant differences were found between registered nurse and registered practical nurse characteristics such as mean age, full-time employment rates, mean years of nursing experience and proportion enrolled in university or college educational programs. Both groups reported weak professional practice environments; however, there were some significant differences between the evaluations by registered nurses and those of registered practical nurses. Although both groups reported weak job satisfaction and moderate levels of burnout, there were significan differences in other responses. Study findings have implications for managing and leading nurses and for strengthening human resources practices.","670":"The quest for nursing excellence requires enthusiasm, commitment and a dedicated team of nurses. The desire to create an environment where nurses were valued, supported and empowered led to the development of a Nursing Professional Practice Council within an Ontario Public Health Unit. The journey is described in detail, from planning and implementation through lessons learned and recommendations for organizations embarking on a similar quest. As a direct result of the Nursing Professional Practice Council, experiences within the organization have exceeded expectations, justified the financial costs and improved relationships among all parties.","671":"","672":"","673":"","674":"","675":"","676":"","677":"","678":"","679":"","680":"During the second half of the 1990s, healthcare in Canada experienced significant downsizing and reform. One of the consequences of these reorganizations has been a reduction in the number of clinical managers and a significant increase in their span of control, to the point that often their abilities to fulfil their role as clinical managers are hindered (Altaffer 1998; Counsell et al. 2001; Pabst 1993). The first-line manager plays a critical role in the delivery of healthcare, in particular, within nursing services. Therefore, providing support for the professional practice of clinical managers should become a priority.","681":"To determine the influence of skills gained in nursing on the transition to a non-nursing career. Little is known about the impact that nursing skills have on the transition to new careers or about the transferability of nursing skills to professions outside nursing. A postal questionnaire was mailed to respondents who had left nursing. The questionnaire included demographic, nursing education and practice information, reasons for entering and leaving nursing, perceptions of the skills gained in nursing and the ease of adjustment to a new career. Data analysis included exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson product moment correlations and linear and multiple regression analysis. Skills learned as a nurse that were valuable in acquiring a career outside nursing formed two factors, including \"management of self and others\" and \"knowledge and skills learned,\" explaining 32% of the variation. The highest educational achievement while working as a nurse, choosing nursing as a \"default choice,\" leaving nursing because of \"worklife\/homelife balance\" and the skills of \"management of self and others\" and \"knowledge and skills\" had a significant relationship with difficulty adjusting to a non-nursing work role and, overall, explained 28% of the variation in this difficulty adjusting. General knowledge and skills learned in nursing prove beneficial in adjusting to roles outside nursing. ","682":"Translation of research into clinical nursing practice has been extensively studied with nurses in civilian institutions. However, limited examination has been made of research utilization in US military facilities. A quantitative survey approach, using Estabrooks's adapted Research Utilization Survey and Mylle's Organizational Climate Survey, was employed to determine the extent that registered nurses in selected US Army Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) use research findings for their own practice and to describe the factors, both professional and organizational, that enhance or hinder research utilization. This study found that nurses at the MTFs reported using research in their practice less than half the time. Variables most significantly correlated with research utilization were belief suspension and attitudes toward research. The variable of support correlated significantly with all types of research utilization except indirect. Other organizational factors influencing nurses' use of research findings in practice were time, accessibility to research and a champion to assist their efforts. Interestingly, the number of years worked in nursing and in the facilities correlated inversely with research utilization, suggesting that over time, nurses may begin to rely on past experience rather than seek out new knowledge for practice.","683":"The Executive Training for Research Application (EXTRA) is a new training program that aims to increase the skills of health services executives and their organizations to use research evidence in healthcare management and decision-making. This paper describes the goals and rationale of the EXTRA program and its learning objectives and curriculum, and reports on some early baseline evaluative research. In particular, the authors address the opportunities that EXTRA offers to leaders in the nursing profession to transform the practice of nursing and patient care, and the unique opportunities that the program offers for collaboration across the healthcare professions and disciplines. While the EXTRA training program requires substantive investment of time and commitment by healthcare leaders and their organizations, it offers great potential for increasing research application in healthcare leadership decision-making. It is therefore a potential long-term lever of cultural decision-making change within healthcare organizations.","684":"","685":"","686":"","687":"","688":"Dementia Special Care Units (SCUs) are more likely to be found in larger nursing homes, which tend to be located in urban centres, rather than in smaller rural nursing homes. Reasons for the small number of rural SCUs are not known, although it has been speculated that space and staffing constraints, lack of a critical mass of residents needing specialized care and limited resources may be important factors. The purpose of this study was to describe the development of SCUs in eight small rural nursing homes (31-100 beds) in Saskatchewan, Canada, from the perspective of nursing directors involved in planning and implementing the units. Although the initial focus was on how and why the SCUs were established, the key finding was the critical role of nursing leadership and supervision in creating and sustaining the unit. Even the most successful SCUs required constant vigilance to maintain an effective program, highlighting their inherent fragility and the need for a designated, committed leader. Four key leadership activities were identified: perpetual reinforcement and enforcement of SCU goals and ideals; support, guidance and mentoring of staff; empowerment of staff; and liaison\/public relations.","689":"With developments in genomics, there is an urgent need for Canadian nurses in all settings to be informed and involved in the incorporation of this new knowledge into healthcare. The purpose of this paper was to synthesize the literature on genetic nursing roles to provide a foundation for Canadian nursing leaders as they take on the challenges of nursing in the genomic era. A comprehensive review of 98 articles published between 1994 and 2004 revealed strong support for genetic nursing roles and recommendations for levels of genetic nursing practice. The few studies on genetic nursing roles suggested that nurses and other health professionals support the integration of genomics into nursing practice. Issues that need to be addressed related to nursing practice, education and research are offered to engage nursing leaders in advocating for the incorporation of genomics into nursing in Canada.","690":"In this paper, the author questions the focus of the patient safety movement, speculating that it might be just another \"bandwagon\" that health executives and some health professionals are eager to join. The history of this current emphasis on patient safety is briefly sketched, including current activities in Canada, and questions are raised about whether the movement aids or avoids pressing healthcare issues, many of which are supported by good evidence. These include the relationship between nursing staffing and patient outcomes, the way in which a \"cult of efficiency\" has operated to make errors more likely and how the silencing of nurses and other staff leads to error. Whether or not one considers the current focus on patient safety a bandwagon, it is important to reflect critically upon the activities undertaken to address the issue and to determine whether one should jump on this bandwagon.","691":"","692":"","693":"","694":"","695":"","696":"The purposes of this study were to determine whether registered nurses are familiar with the Health Canada Medical Device Problem Report Form, and if so, how often they use it to report problems and concerns compared to how often they experience problems and concerns with medical devices. A survey was mailed to a random sample of 1,000 Ontario nurses to collect demographic information and to determine their familiarity with the aforementioned form, as well as the frequency with which they encounter problems\/concerns with medical devices. Seventy-two and a half percent of the nurses reportedly have problems\/concerns with medical devices at least yearly, yet 94.2% of them did not know that the Health Canada Medical Device Problem Report Form existed. Therefore, problems\/concerns with medical devices encountered by registered nurses may be severely under-reported to Health Canada, contributing to an underestimate of the actual threat that devices pose to patient safety.","697":"The aim of this descriptive study was to help policy- and decision-makers enhance the health of the Canadian nursing workforce by highlighting key factors of concern and exploring options for collecting and utilizing nurses' health data. This paper describes the views of 62 nursing stakeholders from a diverse spectrum of professional, labour, management and government perspectives from across Canada, regarding key factors contributing to work-related health problems in the nursing profession, particularly those relating to the work environment and hospital restructuring. The results were combined with a synthesis of existing information sources about the health of nurses in Canada. With respect to the key concerns, musculoskeletal conditions\/injuries and stress and burnout were identified as nurses' major work-related health problems. An examination of the data synthesis inventory revealed that no existing data sources can adequately profile nurses' health, especially in relation to the components of the Conceptual Model of Nurses' Health developed in the study. Three strategies for monitoring nurses' health are proposed.","698":"This study investigated the human resource management strategies that are most important in retaining older RNs in the workforce and the extent to which hospitals are currently engaging in these practices. The participants (n=361) were RNs aged 50 and over employed in hospitals across Ontario. Along with flexible work schedules, the human resource practices rated as most important in the decision of these RNs to remain in the workforce involved compensation (improving benefits; offering incentives for continued employment), recognition and respect (showing appreciation for a job well done; recognizing the experience, knowledge, skill and expertise of older nurses; ensuring that older nurses are treated with respect by others in the organization) and pre- and post-retirement arrangements (retirement with callback; partial or phased retirement options). There were significant differences between the importance that RNs attributed to the 34 human resource practices and the extent to which their hospitals are currently engaged in each practice, with the largest discrepancies occurring for those practices that RNs indicated were most important in their decision to remain in the workforce. While some hospitals may have difficulty in implementing strategies that have budgetary implications, all could implement recognition and respect with minimal financial consequences.","699":"","700":"This pilot study describes the evaluation of an 88-page Toolkit that was developed to guide nursing leaders, including advanced practice nurses, managers and steering committees, who were responsible for coordinating implementation of selected best-practice guidelines (BPG) in their respective agencies. The self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all clinical resource nurses and steering committee members involved in implementing best-practice guidelines. The questionnaire evaluated the usefulness of the content of five chapters (and the case scenarios and worksheets included with each chapter). Sixty-eight percent of respondents returned the questionnaire. More than 85% of them found the Toolkit helpful during the implementation process; 83% reported using it, 80% said they would use it again. The Toolkit was used primarily to identify, analyze and engage stakehoLders, and to assess environmental readiness. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said they used the Toolkit to plan the implementation strategy. The Toolkit assessed in this evaluation shows promise as a useful guide for those charged with BPG implementation. Like other guidelines that are based on evidence, the Toolkit will require occasional updates to ensure that the strategies proposed reflect current evidence. Nursing leaders have a responsibility to keep up to date and to provide efficient and effective healthcare services. Best-practice guidelines or clinical practice guidelines are useful tools that synthesize the latest evidence and provide recommendations for care providers aiming to improve the quality of patient care (Grol 2001). Many leaders are challenged to know how and when to implement the increasing numbers of practice guidelines. The purpose of this article is to describe a pilot study to evaluate a Toolkit that was developed to guide nursing leaders in implementing selected best-practice guidelines (BPGs) in their respective agencies.

The purpose of this study was to test a theoretical model derived from Kanter's theory of organizational empowerment: linking nurse managers' perceptions of structural and psychological empowerment to burnout, job satisfaction and physical and mental health. A descriptive, correlational design was used in a sample of 286 first-line (n=202) and middle-level (n=84) hospital-based nurse managers obtained from a provincial registry. Ironically, managers reported high levels of burnout, but good mental and physical health. Middle managers were more empowered and satisfied with their jobs than first-line managers. In both groups, approximately 45% of the variance in job satisfaction and 18-52% of the variance in physical and mental health was explained by empowerment and burnout. Empowered work environments were associated with lower nurse manager burnout and better physical and mental health. The results suggest that creating work environments that provide access to empowerment structures may be a fruitful strategy for creating healthy work environments for nurse managers.","707":"Recent research has shown that hospital restructuring that included staff layoff has adversely affected the role, health and well-being of nurses who remained employed. Further research found that nurses working in environments that reflected resonant (emotionally intelligent) leadership reported the least negative effects to their healt and well-being following hospital restructuring. What remained unclear was the mechanism by which this mitigation occurred. The purpose of this paper is to explore additional findings from this leadership research and discuss one explanation unique to the academic literature for the mitigation variable--the investment of relational energy by resonant nursing leadership to build relationships with nurses and manage emotion in the workplace.","708":"Nurses are being challenged today to justify their practice. Many clinical and policy decisions in nursing are based upon isolated, ritualistic and unsystematic forms of clinical practice. The growing movement towards establishing evidence-based nursing practice (EBNP) is situated in a systematic appraisal of the best evidence available. Nurse leaders have an obligation to cultivate sound clinical and economic practices leading to quality patient care and positive work life environments for nurses.","709":"Emotional intelligence, a concept well known in the world of business, is quickly gain ing recognition in the healthcare arena. Described as the primal aspect of leadership, emotional intelligence refers to the ability to monitor and discriminate among emotions, and to use the information to guide thought and action. This paper will explore the theoretical and empirical basis of emotional intelligence and its linkages to leadership. Readers will be informed of the origins and theoretical perspectives regarding emotional intelligence, evidence related to the existence of emotional intelligence, benefits and limitations of the concept and implications for nursing leadership.","710":"","711":"Collaborative nursing education programs have been offered to facilitate access to baccalaureate-level nursing education. Our Collaborative Nursing Program involved 10 institutional partners and has been one of the largest of such programs. The collaborative approach to nursing education has been identified as an important model; the benefits include optimal use of resources and opportunities to develop and share knowledge across institutions. However, there has been little public discussion of the issues and challenges that emerge, including differing cultures, priorities, vulnerabilities, goals and aspirations between colleges and universities; desire to preserve autonomy and uniqueness; and complexity of approval and accreditation processes. Some of our college partners have chosen to offer an independent applied degree in nursing rather than continuing in a collaborative academic degree program. This paper describes the challenges inherent in maintaining quality of the degrees and strategies to increase the likelihood of continuing collaboration. Clarity and transparency are vital, and supportive programs involving mentorship of educators can foster increasing autonomy of colleges. Collaborative nursing programs pose many challenges, and their future will hinge on understanding mutual goals and expectations.","712":"","713":"","714":"","715":"The purpose of this study was to test an expanded model of Rosabeth Moss Kanter's Structural Theory of Organizational Behaviour (Kanter 1977; Laschinger, Finegan, Shamian and Wilk 2001) by examining the relationship between nurses' empowerment and their perceptions of effort-reward imbalance (Siegrist 1996). A sample of 112 staff nurses employed in teaching hospitals in Ontario participated in this study (58% return rate). A descriptive correlational survey design was used to collect data by eLiciting responses to five self-report instruments: the Conditions of Work Effectiveness II, the Job Activities Scale II, and the Organizational Relationships Scale II (Laschinger, Finegan, Shamian and Wilk 2001), the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) scale (Siegrist and Peter 1999a) and a demographic questionnaire. Staff nurses were only moderately empowered, and 24.1% perceived their work to have more efforts than rewards, according to Siegrist's guidelines.","716":"This descriptive study explored the perspectives of 51 university nurse graduates from the St. Francis Xavier University School of Nursing. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using telephone interviews to study a range of variables including geographic mobility patterns, career satisfaction and attitudes towards recruitment and retention factors. Given the negative perceptions in the media about nursing, the results of the study were unexpected and offer a sense of hope to those considering nursing as a career. Results indicate that graduates remained enthusiastic about their career choice and would choose nursing again as a career given the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, they would recommend nursing to others as a desirable career. The majority of graduates entered nursing because of a desire to make a meaningful difference in people's lives, and they were strongly influenced by positive nurse role models. Participants remained committed to a career in nursing, enjoyed considerable geographic mobility with migration to other Canadian provinces and the USA, but the majority returned to Canada for employment in nursing. The study confirms that the supportive nature of the work environment in which care is practised, the presence of visible and empowering nurse leaders, adequate compensation and benefits, and appropriate investment in continuing education and professional development of staff are significant factors in retaining nurses. Additional recommendations for enhanced recruitment and retention strategies are provided.","717":"Rural health issues are increasingly recognized as needing attention, but many health policies in Canada are developed for the urban context and universally applied to rural settings. Addressing rural nurses' opportunities for involvement in policy will contribute to our general understanding of rural health while improving community health services. Rural nurses are in a unique position to assist because of their intimate knowledge of their communities and their position as informal community leaders. Challenges to their involvement include decreased numbers and lack of educational preparation about policy. A strength is the higher percentage of rural nurses who are managers compared to their urban counterparts. Nursing education programs need to include theoretical content and practical opportunities related to health policy. Managers need to support rural nurses' attempts in policy development by providing opportunities for membership on policy committees. Finally, once obtaining skills in the policy arena, rural nurses need to work within their communities and workplaces to help develop and implement more appropriate rural-based policies.","718":"With nursing shortages reaching crisis proportions, staff nurses need to believe that nurse managers are supportive. However, evidence exists that staff nurses view nurse managers as moving away from basic nursing values. Using an exploratory philosophical approach, the authors examine this issue as a function of differing ethical frameworks used by nurses and nurse managers. The main question is whether nurse managers are expected to subscribe to a corporate ethic versus a nursing ethic in making decisions, and whether these approaches are fundamentally different. The authors' supposition was that exposing differences might account for some dissatisfaction that nurses express with regard to nursing leadership. They conclude that there are differences of emphasis in ethical principles that may cause tension. Incongruencies between corporate and individual values emerge under fiscal constraints and with differing perceptions, expectations and decision-making criteria. This paper offers suggestions to help staff nurses and nurse managers reduce tensions experienced when difficult choices, particularly those of resource allocation, are required.","719":"","720":"The complex health profile of an older adult entering a hospital presents staff and administrators with a new challenge. This paper documents the Vancouver Island Health Authority's (VIHA) move towards an Elder-Friendly Hospital (EFH). A new approach to hospital care is described, one that takes account not only of an acute healthcare crisis, but also the developmental phenomena associated with aging, with the likelihood of chronic illnesses compounding both diagnosis and treatment. Customized strategies and suggestions for implementation that may be useful to other healthcare agencies are explained.","721":"","722":"In the late 1960s and early '70s, two key events occurred in Ontario that greatly affected the nursing profession: the unionization of the workforce and the move of diploma-granting nursing schools out of the hospitals (first to regional schools, then to the community colleges). At the same time, university nursing programs were undergoing significant changes. A paradigm shift occurred in which baccalaureate-prepared nurses were being educated for practice as well as for roles in education and administration. While all these activities had overall positive implications, there were unintended effects that continue to influence the profession today. These include the detachment of employers from clinical nursing education; fragmentation of the profession between front-line staff and the professional elites (proletarianization); rejection by front-line practitioners and college educators of nursing scholarship in favour of experiential and technical knowledge; and rivalry between college and university educators that has hampered the development of effective collaborations. For this study, interviews were undertaken with three informants, and their recollections were considered in the context of documentation from the College of Nurses of Ontario (the regulatory body), the Ontario Nurses Association (the union) and the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (the professional association).","723":"","724":"Currently, the Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses (ACEN) is working with the Association of Canadian Academic Healthcare Organizations (ACAHO) to develop a joint position paper on patient safety cultures and leadership within Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs). Pressures to improve patient safety within our healthcare system are gaining momentum daily. Because AHSCs in Canada are the key organizations that are positioned regionally and nationally, where service delivery is the platform for the education of future healthcare providers, and where the development of new knowledge and innovation through research occurs, leadership for patient safety logically must emanate from them. As a primer, ACEN provides an overview of current patient safety initiatives in AHSCs to date. In addition, the following six key areas for action are identified to ensure that AHSCs continue to be leaders in delivering quality, safe healthcare in Canada. These include: (1) strategic orientation to safety culture and quality improvement, (2) open and transparent disclosure policies, (3) health human resources integral to ensuring patient safety practices, (4) effective linkages between AHSCs and academic institutions, (5) national patient safety accountability initiatives and (6) collaborative team practice.","725":"","726":"Understanding nurses' perceptions of their workplaces underpins successful recruitment and retention initiatives, particularly in this time of global nursing shortage. The American Nurses Association and the American Academy of Nursing have identified \"magnet characteristics\"--organizational factors that support excellent practice and working conditions in hospital settings. Using selected magnet characteristics, this exploratory study examined nurses' perceptions of their work experiences in both hospital and community settings. Mail surveys were completed by community and hospital nurses (n = 1248) selected randomly from a provincial registry in Ontario, Canada. Scales measured organizational factors (organizational and immediate supervisor support, decentralized decision-making, nurse-physician relationships and work-group cohesiveness) and job-related factors (autonomy, job challenge, work demands, fair treatment, work-status congruence; satisfaction with career, salary, working conditions) of nurses' experiences in their work settings. Nurses in both sectors wanted more opportunities to participate in decision-making and recognition for their contributions to their organizations. In the hospital sector, nurses reported significantly lower levels of perceived organizational and supervisory support and autonomy, and were less satisfied with working conditions and scheduling. Nurses in the community sector were most dissatisfied with salary. No cross-sector differences were reported on nurse-physician relationships, degree of job challenge or career satisfaction. Successful recruitment and retention initiatives hinge on the ability (and willingness) of healthcare organizations to attend to the concerns expressed by nurses and create work settings that are attractive to both new recruits and nurses currently in their employ.","727":"The Innovations in Seniors' Care (Primary Care Partnerships) Project was implemented in 2000 in the Calgary Health Region, Alberta, to look at integration of services for seniors. The goal was to develop a sustainable collaborative partnership between family physicians and Community Care Coordinators--RNs (Home Care). The design and model were established in Stage I of the project. Stage II addressed implementation, challenges, barriers, evaluation, learnings and successes to date. Stage III looked at refinement, revision, final evaluation of the processes and dissemination of learnings. This paper describes startup procedures and implementation (selection of participants, educational sessions, evolution of partnerships and development of the evaluation framework). As the focus of the project was quality improvement, the section on implementation will discuss how and why changes occurred in the course of the process. Key challenges related to the restructuring of Home Care, creating tools and fostering unique individualized partnerships are also discussed. The conclusion evaluates the project's benefits in relation to (1) participant satisfaction, (2) sustainability and (3) impact on the system. The initial partnerships were formed in May 2001. New partnerships continue to be developed and constitute a key strategy in the Calgary Health Region's Primary Care Initiative.","728":"The global paradigm shift resulting from radical transformations in knowledge and technology is significantly changing the context of healthcare delivery. In this changing environment, the contributions of health professions are vital in ensuring that the healthcare system adapts to meet the needs of today's patient.

Use of shared or participative decision-making recognizes that decisions made for the overall good of the organization should include those integrally involved, i.e., faculty, students and administration. Ultimately, effective student learning should be the outcome of decisions related to curricular and content delivery. In this anecdotal paper, the authors present shared decision-making (SDM) as a management strategy that may be effectively utilized in a range of situations in educational settings. An exemplar is presented regarding changes in course delivery methods at two sister schools of nursing. Strategies to promote successful implementation, as well as challenges in initiating SDM, are discussed. The information presented in this paper can benefit nurse educators by offering a collaborative approach to the issues of evolving nursing curricula and content delivery.","731":"","732":"The Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) recently revised its 1997 Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses to reflect the context within which nurses practise today. Given the unprecedented changes that have taken place within the profession, healthcare and society, it was timely for the CNA to review and revise its Code. But the revisions were relatively minor; important problematic, substantive aspects of the Code were essentially left untouched and persist in the updated 2002 Code. In this paper, three of those aspects are examined and discussed: the 2002 Code's (a) definition of health and well-being, (b) notion of respect and (c) conception of justice. Recommendations are made. It is hoped that these comments will encourage nurse leaders in Canada to initiate discussion of the Code now, in preparation for its next planned revision in 2007.","733":"","734":"","735":"","736":"","737":"","738":"Health reform in many industrialized countries has prompted the shift from institutional to community care. In Ontario, this approach was instigated through the Health Services Restructuring Commission. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in the hospital sector between 1996 and 2000 resulted in changes in the provision of home-care services by nurses and practical nurses. This study was a retrospective trend analysis of linked hospitalization and home-care utilization data for Kingston for 1996 to 2000. The measures include the rate of home care and the volume and intensity of home-care services. Between 1996 and 2000 there was a net 4% increase in the age-gender standardized rate of admission to home-care nursing services, with a 10% rate rise between 1996 and 1997. The total volume of home-care services increased during the study, as did the average intensity of home-care service delivery over the first month post-hospitalization during the first four years. This article will give readers their first look at the changes in home-care nursing following hospital restructuring in Kingston.

Using the findings and recommendations of the Canadian Nursing Advisory Report Committee (2002) as a catalyst, nurse leaders from Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Columbia (C&amp;W) have collaborated to develop principles of nursing leadership to be used as a resource in determining roles and functions of front-line nurse leaders throughout the organization. In this paper, the process of creating those nursing leadership principles is described with a focus on the unit-based operational leader. Suggestions are made on how to evaluate the effectiveness of principle-based nursing leadership as implemented at C&amp;W and its utility to the unit-based operational leader.","740":"In healthcare, organizations recognize that human capital is their most valuable asset. The importance of investing in knowledge workers is imperative given the current and future shortage of health professionals. Knowledge acquisition occurs through continuous learning and the transfer of information from those who are highly experienced to those who are less qualified. At St. Michael's Hospital, two innovative and unique programs were created for the transfer of knowledge. The first was a nurse fellowship program that enabled experienced nurses to spend two to three months learning new skills to advance clinical practice. The second was a nurse internship program in which new graduates spend three to four months in their area of hire to enhance clinical practice through skill development and prioritization of patient care needs. This paper describes both programs and presents an evaluation of the new-graduate internship program as an opportunity for professional development and career enhancement For nurse interns, the program promotes self-esteem and professional confidence, improves job satisfaction and rewards nurses for their contribution. For nurse preceptors, the program provides job enrichment, experience in teaching and recognition by the organization and peers that they are knowledge experts. In healthcare, organizations have come to acknowledge that their most valuable asset is human capital, in particular, knowledge workers (Horibe 1999). Knowledge workers contribute a composite of information, intellectual property and experience (Horibe 1999), acquired by study, investigation, observation or practice (Webster's Dictionary 1989). Investing in knowledge workers is investing in the future. In this regard, organizations have implemented recruitment and retention strategies to attract, retain and advance the highest calibre of health professional. Knowledge workers contribute to an organization through their ideas, analyses of complex situations and sound judgment in decision-making (Horibe 1999). They further develop these skills over the course of their career through continuous learning. This paper will focus on the importance of investing in nurses as knowledge workers. In particular, given the shortage of nurses and the reality that 25% of today's nurses can retire over the next 10 years (CNA 2001), it is imperative that knowledge transfer occur from highly experienced to less experienced nurses.","741":"","742":"There has been ongoing confusion about the meaning of advanced nursing practice (ANP) and the nature of ANP roles in Canada and elsewhere. A broad range of roles and titles have been adopted throughout Canada in an attempt to delineate specialized and\/or advanced roles within nursing. One key objective in a recent three-phase study of ANP in British Columbia was to clarify the role and understanding of advanced nursing practice and related roles within the larger healthcare system. Our intent in this paper is to describe the understandings of ANP that emerged in Phase I of this recent study and to compare registered nurses' understandings of ANP to the characteristics and competencies identified by the Canadian Nurses Association (2002) framework.

Nova Scotia. Like other provinces, is seeking ways to improve the healthcare that it provides within a financially constrained publicly funded system. The Strengthening Primary Care Initiative in Nova Scotia (SPCI) was a primary care demonstration project to evaluate specific goals related to primary care. Although the provincial government conceived the SPCI, the approach to its planning and implementation was participatory and consultative. Funded through the federal Health Transition Fund (HTF) (Health Canada 2002) and the government of Nova Scotia, the SPCI involved changes in four communities over a three-year period (2000-2002). These changes included the introduction of a primary healthcare nurse practitioner in collaborative practice with one or more family physicians; remuneration of the family physician(s) with methods other than a solely fee-for-service (FFS) arrangement; and the introduction and utilization of a computerized patient medical record. The SPCI was committed to a consultative process with stakeholders, and this gave rise to several challenges. Initially there was disagreement on the requirement for nurse practitioners at each of the demonstration sites. The Minister of Health confirmed that a nurse practitioner was a required component at each demonstration site. Differences in perspectives on the role of allied health professionals in the SPCI were encountered, and the significance of the role pharmacists have in primary care was not fully appreciated until after the SPCI had started. At the time the SPCI began there was no legislation for nurse practitioners in Nova Scotia; therefore, an approval mechanism for nurse practitioner practice was authorized through the provincial regulatory bodies for nursing and medicine. Malpractice and liability issues, particularly on the part of providers who had never worked with nurse practitioners before, were an initial concern. Recruitment of nurse practitioners into the three rural sites mirrored the difficulties with recruitment of healthcare providers encountered in other parts of rural Canada. The authors discuss their perspectives on the challenges related to interdisciplinary collaboration in health systems change that were encountered during the planning and implementation of the SPCI. Although nurse practitioner Legislation has existed in Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador for several years, many provinces are grappling with the challenges associated with the introduction of nurse practitioners and collaborative practice. This paper conveys the experience of one province and will be of interest to administrators, educators and practitioners elsewhere in Canada who are engaged in primary healthcare renewal.","745":"","746":"","747":"","748":"","749":"Incontinence is becoming an increasingly widespread phenomenon. Individuals who suffer from incontinence-related problems, as well as their loved ones, must learn to live with daily situations that are often extremely demanding. In recent years, it has become evident that incontinence can be cured, or at least successfully managed. Many nurses, however, lack sufficient knowledge and skills to intervene appropriately in dealing with problems associated with a lack of bladder control. Therefore, the continence team of the Sherbrooke Geriatric University Institute developed a urinary incontinence educational program for nurses who care for older persons with this problem. An assessment of the impact of this program on nurses' knowledge, intervention skills and attitudes was conducted. A quasi-experimental protocol based on single-group with repeated-measures design was used for this study. A convenience sample was made up of 10 staff members at the Sherbrooke Geriatric University Institute. The study demonstrated a significant improvement in participants' knowledge, skills and attitudes (p=0.005, p=0.005 and p=0.017, respectively). Furthermore, the effects of the program in regard to the acquisition of skills and knowledge by nurses were still evident nine weeks after the program. The value of the present study lies in the development and positive evaluation of a new incontinence educational program for nurses based on a problem-solving approach.","750":"This paper describes nurses' experiences of violence and abuse in the workplace and the ways in which those experiences influence their abilities to care for patients. The original purpose of the research from which these findings derive was to explore nurses' work with abused women. The qualitative study utilizing a Social Constructivism approach was conducted in two countries: Canada and the United Kingdom. Forty-nine nurses from four clinical areas were interviewed, both in focus groups and individually, about factors influencing their care of abused women. In the course of the original study, the degree of verbal abuse and physical violence that nurses routinely encounter in their work became apparent. It also became clear that abuse against nurses is an important issue that has a significant impact on nurses' abilities to offer effective care. Findings indicated that nurses experience significant threat, frequently in the context of their work, at the hands of patients and their relatives; that verbal abuse is an almost daily occurrence; and that support from other healthcare professionals or from administration in addressing the issue, while improving somewhat, is inadequate. This work has implications not only for nurses' health and safety but also, in the broader sense, for the profession's ability to attract and retain nurses within the healthcare system.","751":"Canadian nursing leadership is called to advance a national patient safety agenda for the delivery of safe, quality care in professional practice environments. Yet, the nursing discipline is burdened by issues and challenges related to clinical practice and workplace dilemmas that contribute to barriers and obstacles to safe, quality and humane care. We propose that the many clinical challenges faced by nurses in Canada can be more fully understood when framed by a patient safety perspective. Nurse executive leaders and nurse scientists are called to reform clinical practice and conduct research to reconcile patient care safety issues. This paper applies findings obtained from nurses via focus groups led by the Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses (ACEN) and integrates these findings into a patient safety perspective via a conceptual framework.","752":"","753":"","754":"The concept of self-care is multidimensional, with many defining elements. This paper describes the origin of this comprehensive concept. It examines the response of the nursing discipline to citizen self-care initiatives and the subsequent effects this response has had on the development of nursing knowledge. The evolution of self-care as a core concept within Canadian health policy is presented; the potential readiness fo citizens to accept self-care as an aspect of healthcare delivery is explored, identifying potential benefits and obstacles. The paper concludes with a proposed self-care approach to healthcare reform in Canada and the subsequent influence this approach may have on the discipline of nursing. The congruency between a self-care healthcare delivery system and the theoretical foundations and perspective of healthcare delivery held by the nursing discipline is discussed. The role nurses might assume in shaping a self-care healthcare delivery system is delineated.","755":"In 1925, Canadian nurse leader Ethel Johns was hired by the Rockefeller Foundation to study the status of black women in nursing in the United States. Despite the acknowledged excellence of her report, the study was shelved. It remained \"buried\" in the basement of the Rockefeller headquarters for almost 60 years until American historian Darlene Clark Hine discovered it there in the 1980s. The aim of this article is to extend current understandings of Johns based on this and other evidence not accessible to her biographer in 1973. The discussion will illuminate her commitment to social equality by highlighting the 1925 report that perceived and articulated the racist character of relations between white institutions and black nurses in an era when few others would do so. It seems vital that this study be recognized as a focal point in Johns's outstanding nursing career, and that her success in leadership be acknowledged as inextricably linked with her passion for justice and equality.","756":"","757":"","758":"","759":"","760":"Parallel to the shortage of clinical nurses is the diminishing pool of nurses who aspire to leadership roles in healthcare. The authors of this paper report on the evaluation of an intervention administered to a group of Canadian nurses designed to assist participants to value leadership and to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes required for effective leadership. A one-group pre-test, post-test quasi-experimental design guided the study. All participants received a five-day residential leadership development intervention. Participants acted as their own controls and were assessed, both immediately before intervention implementation and three months later, on the self- and observer-reported leadership practices as well as self-reported levels of burnout. Results indicated that a concentrated, residential leadership development intervention is effective in strengthening leadership behaviours performed by both already established and aspiring nurse leaders from the perspective of observers, but not from self-reported assessments. No significant changes in self-reported burnout levels were found. It is possible to deliver leadership development interventions to both established and aspiring nurse leaders that result in fairly rapid improvements in observed leadership practices.","761":"This paper describes a unit-based quality improvement initiative to ameliorate mouth care of elderly residents in a long-term care facility. Using the Nursing Role Effectiveness Model developed by Irvine et at. (1998) as the organizing framework, this project highlights the importance of the nurse's role in quality improvement initiatives.","762":"There is debate within the nursing profession in regard to determining the best approach to Leadership development for the new millennium. Should nursing adopt career pathways Like other disciplines that enable individuals to develop leadership potential in a timely fashion? St. Francis Xavier University (StFXU), the number one ranked undergraduate school in the country (DeMont 2002), has established an innovative strategy that promotes Leadership development at the undergraduate level. It has launched a special stream of its BScN program that culminates in an honours degree. The program, the first of its type in Canada, is designed to produce nursing leaders and scholars who will possess the core competencies required for leadership in diverse environments. This paper discusses the role of honours education in nursing, describes the curriculum and related Learning activities in the StFXU honours program and explores the benefits and challenges that an honours program has to offer. The findings will benefit nurse leaders in educational and practice settings, professional organizations and policy arenas who are interested in influencing the development of leadership in nursing.","763":"","764":"This paper discusses the challenges that staff nurses face when moving into formal Leadership positions. Current transition strategies for nurses are presented, including a critical analysis of organizational and individual factors that enhance or impede the transition to front-line nurse leadership positions. Recommendations outline essential practices, resources available and support networks that enable a smooth transition into these positions. Reflections on the author's personal transition to a front-line nurse leadership position are included.","765":"","766":"Mental health reform, health services restructuring and changes in mental health legislation have resulted in a shift from hospital-based to community-based treatment for individuals with serious and persistent mental illness. A system-wide response to this trend has been the implementation of interdisciplinary Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams in the province of Ontario. The need for efficient, cLient-centred versus discipline-centred community care has prompted ACT teams to challenge traditional scopes of practice. This paper describes the Oral Medication Administration Guidelines Project as a mechanism for facilitating innovative team-based work design for oral medication administration in the community. The resulting provincewide guidelines can assist interdisciplinary ACT teams to design relevant training, improve work efficiencies and implement policies and procedures to manage client risk in relation to oral medication administration in the community.","767":"","768":"","769":"","770":"","771":"","772":"","773":"Reorganization of nurses' work has raised questions about the effects of working conditions on their health. Nurses, for example, are more likely to miss work because of illness and disability than employees in other occupations. The overall purpose of this descriptive study was to investigate the feasibility of using existing Statistics Canada surveys regularly to describe and monitor the health and working conditions of nurses. Our findings identified significant limitations in existing Statistics Canada surveys, for the study of nurses, including nonspecific or no occupational coding, small samples and partial content related to the work environment. As a result, some estimates would need to be accompanied by statements indicating that the findings do not meet quality standards and that the conclusions would be unreliable and most likely invalid. Additional data are required for a comprehensive assessment of the health status of nurses and the work environment factors that influence their health. These data can be obtained through several vehicles, including using over-sampling strategies for extant and recurring Statistics Canada surveys, adding additional content to those surveys or implementing new surveys specific to nurses and their work. The authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches and conclude that monitoring the health and work environment of nurses in Canada in sufficient detail to inform policy decisions requires a dedicated national survey.","774":"E-Nursing represents an innovative approach to nursing education that has the potential to support professional practice throughout the institution. This paper details the benefits, design and promotion of an electronic nursing resource collection. How to divide responsibility, cost and expertise in such a project is also discussed. Preliminary usage statistics validate E-Nursing as a point-of-care education tool for nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital. A planned approach to implementation has been an effective means of introducing E-Nursing in an institution that previously relied on traditional hard-copy resources housed in the hospital's library.","775":"","776":"Many changes have taken place in the healthcare system that have influenced nurse autonomy, job satisfaction and client satisfaction. Standardized language facilitates communication within the discipline of nursing. Examples of such language include the Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) and the Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) systems as well as the Nursing Minimum Data Set (NMDS), which provides a formal structure for electronic data sets to support nursing care. The Nursing Management Minimum Data Set (NMMDS) was designed to identify variables to guide nurse managers in evaluating the impact of nursing interventions on client outcomes. Gaps within NMDS and NMMDS are discussed, and solutions are proposed.","777":"","778":"The proliferation of program management coupled with the Introduction of the Regulated Health Professions Act, prompted many healthcare organizations in Ontario to introduce professional practice models. In addition, the Magnet Hospitals research (Kramer and Schmalenberg 1988) identified the existence of a professional practice model as a key element for recruitment and retention of professional staff. Professional practice models were introduced to address issues of accountability, identity and overlapping scopes of practice as experienced by healthcare professionals and organizations across the continuum of care. The authors of this paper describe exploratory work done through the Professional Practice Network of Ontario to identify the essential elements of the \"ideal\" professional practice structure, key areas of challenge and strategies for adapting these elements into an organization. The paper presents a list of 16 essential elements of an ideal professional practice structure with a further discussion on four key areas consistently identified as areas of challenge. This paper is intended to report, not the findings of a formal research study, but rather the result of facilitated dialogue among professional practice leaders in Ontario. The information will be of interest to healthcare organizations across the continuum of care and to professional associations and academic institutions, as we all address the challenges of creating a quality work environment that supports and fosters excellence in professional practice.","779":"","780":"The nursing shortage is likely to continue and, without intervention, may worsen. While retention and recruitment are constantly discussed among nursing leaders, the shortages, particularly in specialty areas, continue. Nurses have frequently stated that they are not valued for their knowledge. Yet many nurses have university degrees, post graduate degrees, specialty certificates and specialty credentials. Nurses seek recognition for what they know and what they do. To date, however, there is no objective method that is used to assess the value of nurses and their work. The study of relative value may provide a method for recognizing nurses' work. The concept of relative value deals with logical operators and facilitates assigning value to a nurse's overall knowledge base and capacity to perform nursing work. Currently, nursing shortages are concentrated in specialty areas. Nurses who work in specialized areas need specialized knowledge in a narrow field of nursing. Specialty nurses are not interchangeable with specialists in other areas or with generalists. A study is in progress to calculate the relative value of nursing work in 15 specialties. The goal is to assess relative value from the point of view of the knowledge base in the specialties and between specialties. In this paper, the research team reports on the background of the study, the study's parameters and its progress to date. Outcomes will include devising a way to recognize nurses' work, developing policies related to retention and recruitment and finding a long-term solution for dealing with the nursing shortage in specialty areas.","781":"","782":"","783":"","784":"","785":"","786":"","787":"","788":"","789":"","790":"This paper is developed from a research study that examined the hospitalization and helpseeking experiences of diverse ethnocultural populations in the era of healthcare restraint. Interview data were gathered from 60 patients while hospitalized and after their discharge home. Fifty-six healthcare professionals, the majority of whom were nurses caring for these patients while they were in hospital, were also interviewed. The data gathered in this study provides evidence to illustrate how restructuring associated with fiscal restraint designed to enhance efficiencies while ensuring the provision of medically necessary services, has had unintended consequences for some groups of patients and for nurses. These consequences have created a context for inequities in care delivery for those most vulnerable. In this paper we trace the ways in which the changed context of care delivery has exerted its effects on both nurses and patients and illustrate how each has sought to bridge gaps created when organizational supports are lacking. Our study data offer insight into the complexities of the practice setting and difficulties that arise when resources cannot be mobilized to match patients' needs. Our analysis examines how tensions between ideologies of efficiency and accessibility are navigated at the front lines, and draws attention to unintended consequences of the current policy context.","791":"Recent events in the Newfoundland and Labrador healthcare system, including changes to nursing scope of practice, have had a profound effect on practice environments for direct care registered nurses (RNs) and Licensed practical nurses (LPNs). This article describes an initiative introduced by the Association of Registered Nurses of Newfoundland and Labrador (ARNNL) and the Council for Licensed Practical Nurses (CLPN) in response to concerns raised by healthcare providers related to collaboration and teamwork between RNs and LPNs. Through the Learning Circles Project, the ARNNL and CLPN committed to fostering an improved working relationship for nursing team members based on the values of working together, mutual respect and an enhanced working environment.","792":"This paper describes a clinical nurse specialist\/clinical nurse specialist-nurse practitioner (CNS\/CNS-NP) internship program in a tertiary care teaching hospital Hamilton Health Sciences, located in south-central Ontario, Canada. The goal of the program is to increase the number of fully qualified CNS\/CNS-NPs in the organization. With this program, Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) is able to recognize and reward nurses already employed within the hospital. The program assists nurses in transition to the CNS\/CNS-NP role while they are completing the required educational requirements. The authors describe the components of the internship program, responsibilities of participants and the infrastructure required to support the program. Overall the internship program is a valuable mechanism for supporting the development of advanced practice roles in the hospital setting.","793":"As the healthcare workforce ages and workers expect increasingly flexible work environments, employers are looking for creative strategies to maintain a healthy and vital workforce. This paper offers one such strategy. It describes a job-share experience by two senior administrators within a large healthcare authority and provides the findings from a survey evaluation.","794":"In late 2002, the Office of Nursing Policy convened a \"Think Tank\" of Canadian nurse scientists and policy-makers to create an opportunity to articulate the major challenges in advancing the nursing science agenda in Canada, and also to discuss what action(s) might be taken to address these challenges. Together, participants identified a number of challenges as follows: * increasing the pool and critical mass of nurse scientists * maximizing career trajectory * aligning focus of research with sources of research funding * enhancing linkages between practice and science * building research programs evaluating scientific productivity, and recognizing individual scientists * capitalizing on nursing research opportunities and * investing in leadership and succession planning. Participants subsequently selected four of these challenges as priorities and identified key collaborative opportunities to address them. Given this promising start, it seems that nursing is positioning itself to make a significant contribution to health research.","795":"Partnership is a term that is occurring more and more frequently in the research lexicon, an approach that is gradually becoming a sine qua non in the field of health and healthcare research in Canada. The purpose of this article is to share thoughts and experiences regarding research carried out in partnership. The relevance and necessity of partnerships in strategic health research will be examined, and the contribution of partnerships to the development and \"re-centring\" of intra- and interdisciplinary knowledge and knowledge transfer will be discussed. Based on the nursing and related-fields literature, the key elements of partnership, and the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy to pursuing research projects will be presented. An important issue in a professional discipline such as nursing will be discussed, i.e. the intra-disciplinary partnership between researchers and clinicians. Strategies that could enhance this particular type of partnership and avenues for catalyzing the synergy that must perforce develop, over the coming years, will be proposed.","796":"The language used to describe nursing practice and nursing leadership has a profound influence on how nurses think about themselves, their work relationships, and indeed the very essence of their reason for being. Language often includes metaphor in order to help capture the complexities and layers of meaning that establish contexts for action. Nurses and others have relied on various metaphors to describe nursing work. However, there is one metaphor that, more than any other, has shaped the context of nursing work and formed the images and the meanings that nurses have of themselves and their purposes in practice. The privileged one is the military metaphor. This article explores the notion of metaphor, and its usefulness and potential to help nurses change their work patterns. The traditions and history of the military metaphor are examined and an alternative notion of the \"frontier\" is proposed in order to enhance understanding of the potential for change.","797":"","798":"","799":"","800":"","801":"","802":"","803":""},"articletitle":{"0":"A Scoping Review of Followership in Nursing.","1":"Optimizing the Nursing Role in Abortion Care: Considerations for Health Equity.","2":"Enhancing Nurse Practitioner Students' Understanding of Political Processes through Stakeholder Collaboration Using Deliberative Dialogue.","3":"Influencing Work Culture: A Strengths-Based Nursing Leadership and Management Education Program.","4":"Case Study: Achieving \"Hands-On\" Practice for Remote Family Caregivers and Homecare Nurses of Children with Medical Complexity.","5":"Welcome, Dr. Martin-Misener.","6":"Leadership in - and Despite - Troubled Times.","7":"Nurses Have Names.","8":"What If?
