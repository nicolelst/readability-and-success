a pandemic in March 2020, the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), led to new guidelines and restrictions being implemented for individuals, businesses, and societies in efforts to limit the impacts of COVID-19 on personal health and healthcare systems. Here we report the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pancreas processing and islet isolation\/distribution outcomes at the Alberta Diabetes Institute IsletCore, a facility specializing in the processing and distribution of human pancreatic islets for research. While the number of organs processed was significantly reduced, organ quality and the function of cellular outputs were minimally impacted during the pandemic when compared to an equivalent period immediately prior. Despite the maintained quality of isolated islets, feedback from recipient groups was more negative. Our findings suggest this is likely due to disrupted distribution which led to increased transit times to recipient labs, particularly those overseas. Thus, to improve overall outcomes in a climate of limited research islet supply, prioritization of tissue recipients based on likely tissue transit times may be needed.","4":"The islets of Langerhans are highly organized structures that have species-specific, three-dimensional tissue architecture. Islet architecture is critical for proper hormone secretion in response to nutritional stimuli. Islet architecture is disrupted in all types of diabetes mellitus and in cadaveric islets for transplantation during isolation, culture, and perfusion, limiting patient outcomes. Moreover, recapitulating native islet architecture remains a key challenge for in vitro generation of islets from stem cells. In this review, we discuss work that has led to the current understanding of determinants of pancreatic islet architecture, and how this architecture is maintained or disrupted during tissue remodeling in response to normal and pathological metabolic changes. We further discuss both empirical and modeling data that highlight the importance of islet architecture for islet function.","5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":"The continuous interaction between experimental and theoretical work has proven to be extremely useful for the study of pancreatic cells and, recently, of pancreatic islets. This prolific interaction relies on the capability of implementing computational models and methods to derive quantitative data for the analysis and interpretation of experimental observations. In this addendum I introduce Isletlab, a multiplatform application developed to provide the research community with a user-friendly interface for the implementation of computational algorithms for the characterization and simulation of pancreatic islets.","9":"Intra-islet communication via electrical, paracrine and autocrine signals, is highly dependent on the organization of cells within the islets and is key for an adequate response to changes in blood glucose and other stimuli. In spite of the fact that relevant structural differences between mouse and human islet architectures have been described, the functional implications of these differences remain only partially understood. In this work, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between structural and functional properties of pancreatic islets, we reconstructed human and mice islets in order to perform a structural comparison based on both morphologic and network-derived metrics. According to our results, human islets constitute a more efficient network from a connectivity viewpoint, mainly due to the higher proportion of heterotypic contacts between islet cells in comparison to mice islets.","10":null,"11":null,"12":"The success of clinical transplantation of pancreas or isolated pancreatic islets supports the concept of cell-based cure for diabetes. One limitation is the shortage of cadaver human pancreata. The demand-supply gap could potentially be bridged by harnessing the self-renewal capacity of stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells and adult pancreatic stem cells have been explored as possible cell sources. Recently, a system for long-term culture of proposed adult pancreatic stem cells in a form of organoids was developed. Generated organoids partially mimic the architecture and cell-type composition of pancreatic tissue. Here, we review the attempts over the past decade, to utilize the organoid cell culture principles in order to identify, expand, and differentiate the adult pancreatic stem cells from different compartments of mouse and human pancreata. The development of the culture conditions, effects of specific growth factors and small molecules is discussed. The potential utility of the adult pancreatic stem cells is considered in the context of other cell sources.","13":"Frederick Banting approached Toronto physiology professor JJR Macleod with a way to prevent pancreatic trypsin from destroying the pancreas' internal secretion. Banting proposed to induce exocrine atrophy by ligating canine pancreatic ducts and to use extracts of islet-rich residua to treat pancreatectomized dogs. His next plan was to make extracts from fetal pancreas, which he had read was islet-rich and lacked exocrine tissue capable of making trypsin; this work has not been historically evaluated. Banting's fetal calf pancreas story is told using primary and secondary historical sources and then critically examined using both historical and recent data on species phylogeny, islet ontogeny, fetal\/neonatal islet culture\/transplantation, etc. Results\/Discussion: Only ruminants develop dual islets populations sequentially; fetal calf pancreata, at the gestational ages Banting used, possess numerous insulin-rich giant peri-lobular islets, which credibly explain the potency of his fetal calf insulin extract. Use of non-ruminant fetal pancreata would have failed. ","14":"Pancreatic islet transplantation to restore insulin production in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients is commonly performed by infusion of islets into the hepatic portal system. However, the risk of portal vein thrombosis or elevation of portal pressure after transplantation introduces challenges to this procedure. Thus, alternative sites have been investigated, among which the omentum represents an ideal candidate. The surgical site is easily accessible, and the tissue is highly vascularized with a large surface area for metabolic exchange. Furthermore, the ability of the omentum to host large volumes of islets represents an intriguing if not ideal site for encapsulated islet transplantation. Research on the safety and efficacy of the omentum as a transplant site focuses on the utilization of biologic scaffolds or encapsulation of islets in a biocompatible semi-permeable membrane. Currently, more clinical trials are required to better characterize the safety and efficacy of islet transplantation into the omentum.","15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":"Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an important peptide hormone secreted by L-cells in the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrients. It is produced by the differential cleavage of the proglucagon peptide. GLP-1 elicits a wide variety of physiological responses in many tissues that contribute to metabolic homeostasis. For these reasons, therapies designed to either increase endogenous GLP-1 levels or introduce exogenous peptide mimetics are now widely used in the management of diabetes. In addition to GLP-1 production from L-cells, recent reports suggest that pancreatic islet alpha cells may also synthesize and secrete GLP-1. Intra-islet GLP-1 may therefore play an unappreciated role in islet health and glucose regulation, suggesting a potential functional paracrine role for islet-derived GLP-1. In this review, we assess the current literature from an islet-centric point-of-view to better understand the production, degradation, and actions of GLP-1 within the endocrine pancreas in rodents and humans. The relevance of intra-islet GLP-1 in human physiology is discussed regarding the potential role of intra-islet GLP-1 in islet health and dysfunction.","21":null,"22":null,"23":"This study aimed to assess the global mapping risk of human islet isolation, using a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), and highlight the impact of quality assurance procedures on the risk level of criticality. Risks were scored using the risk priority number (RPN) scoring method. The risk level of criticality was made based on RPN and led to risk classification (low to critical). A raw risk analysis and a risk control analysis (with control means and quality assurance performance) were undertaken. The process of human islet isolation was divided into 11 steps, and 230 risks were identified. Analysis of the highest RPN of each of the 11 steps showed that the 4 highest risks were related to the pancreas digestion and islet purification stages. After implementation of reduction measures and controls, critical and severe risks were reduced by 3-fold and by 2-fold, respectively, so that 90% of risks could be considered as low to moderate. FMEA has proven to be a powerful approach for the identification of weaknesses in the islet isolation processes. The results demonstrated the importance of staff qualification and continuous training and supported the contribution of the quality assurance system to risk reduction.","24":null,"25":null,"26":"We outline a general methodology based on computational optimization and experimental data to reconstruct human pancreatic islet architectures. By using the nuclei coordinates of islet cells obtained through DAPI staining, cell types identified by immunostaining, and cell size distributions estimated from capacitance measurements, reconstructed islets composed of non-overlapping spherical cells were obtained through an iterative optimization procedure. In all cases, the reconstructed architectures included &gt;99% of the experimental identified cells, each of them having a radius within the experimentally reported ranges. Given the wide use of mathematical modeling for the study of pancreatic cells, and recently, of cell-cell interactions within the pancreatic islets, the methodology here proposed, also capable of identifying cell-to-cell contacts, is aimed to provide with a framework for modeling and analyzing experimentally-based pancreatic islet architectures.","27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Currently, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of how to reverse or prevent beta cell loss in individuals with T1D. Previous studies in mice discovered that pharmacologically inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis using difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) resulted in preserved beta cell function and mass. Similarly, treatment of non-obese diabetic mice with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib mesylate reversed diabetes. The promising findings from these animal studies resulted in the initiation of two separate clinical trials that would repurpose either DFMO (NCT02384889) or Imatinib (NCT01781975) and determine effects on diabetes outcomes; however, whether these drugs directly stimulated beta cell growth remained unknown. To address this, we used the zebrafish model system to determine pharmacological impact on beta cell regeneration. After induction of beta cell death, zebrafish embryos were treated with either DFMO or Imatinib. Neither drug altered whole-body growth or exocrine pancreas length. Embryos treated with Imatinib showed no effect on beta cell regeneration; however, excitingly, DFMO enhanced beta cell regeneration. These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis may be a promising therapeutic option to stimulate beta cell regeneration in the setting of diabetes.","31":null,"32":"Virus-mediated gene knockdown in intact pancreatic islets is technically challenging due to poor infection of the center of the islet. Because the cells that do not have knockdown have normal insulin secretion, measuring changes in insulin secretion after gene knockdown is challenging. We describe a method to monitor insulin secretion from only the beta cells with knockdown of a gene of interest in intact islets using a single lentivirus containing a guide RNA, a luciferase insulin secretion reporter and a dCas9-KRAB cassette. This method allows rapid and inexpensive monitoring of insulin secretion from only those beta cells with knockdown, circumventing the problem of incomplete islet infection.","33":null,"34":null,"35":"High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) can act as a structural protein of the chromatin and at the same time as a mediator of the immune system. Its high correlation with the graft acceptance in pancreatic islet recipients makes it a biomarker in islet transplantation. With the suspicion that preexisting HMGB1 in the fetal bovine serum (FBS) would be detrimental to the viability and function of murine beta cells, HMGB1 was removed from FBS and its impact was investigated. Interestingly, the elimination of HMGB1 from FBS seemed unfavorable to the viability and function of cultured murine beta cells, suggesting that the preexisting HMGB1 in the FBS may be an indispensable component of islet cell culture.","36":"The pancreas of brain-dead donors is the primary source of islets for transplantation. However, brain death mediates systemic inflammation, which may affect the quantity and quality of isolated islets. Our aim was to identify inflammatory biomarkers in donor blood and\/or pancreatic tissue capable of predicting islet isolation success. Blood samples were collected from 21 pancreas donors and 14 healthy volunteers. Pancreatic tissue samples were also collected from the corresponding donor during organ procurement. Six serum cytokines were measured by a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay, and the expression of fifteen inflammatory target genes was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). There was no correlation between serum inflammatory cytokines and mRNA expression of the corresponding genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or pancreatic tissue. The IL6 expression in pancreatic tissue correlated negatively with post-isolation islet yield. Islets isolated from donors highly expressing IFNG in PBMCs and MAC1 in pancreatic tissue functioned poorly in vivo when transplanted in diabetic NODscid mice. Furthermore, the increased MAC1 in pancreatic tissue was positively correlated with donor hospitalization time. Brain death duration positively correlated with higher expression of IL1B in PBMCs and TNF in both PBMCs and pancreatic tissue but failed to show a significant correlation with islet yield and in vivo function. The study indicates that the increased inflammatory genes in donor pancreatic tissues may be considered as biomarkers associated with poor islet isolation outcome.","37":"Curcumin possesses medicinal properties that are beneficial in various diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM). It has been proposed that pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in T2 DM is promoted by oxidative stress caused by NADPH oxidase over-activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin as a protective agent against high glucose\/palmitate (HP)-induced islet cell damage and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM rats. INS-1 cells were exposed to HP with or without curcumin. Cell proliferation, islet cell morphological changes, reactive oxygen species production, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, insulin levels, NADPH oxidase subunit expression, and the expression of apoptotic factors by INS-1 cells were observed. Our results show that curcumin can effectively inhibit the impairment of cell proliferation and activated oxidative stress, increase insulin levels, and reduce the high expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and apoptotic factors induced by HP in INS-1 cells. The STZ-induced DM rat model was also used to determine whether curcumin can protect islets in vivo. Our results show that curcumin significantly reduced pathological damage and increased insulin levels of islets in STZ-induced DM rats. Curcumin also successfully inhibited the high expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and apoptotic factors in STZ-induced DM rats. These results suggest that curcumin is able to attenuate HP-induced oxidative stress in islet cells and protect these cells from apoptosis by modulating the NADPH pathway. In view of its efficiency, curcumin has potential for translation applications in protecting islets from glucolipotoxicity.","38":"Background &amp; objectives: Islet of Langerhans, the endocrine pancreas plays a significant role in glucose metabolism. Obesity and insulin resistance are the major factors responsible for beta cell dysfunction. Asian Indian population has increased susceptibility to diabetes in spite of having lower BMI. The morphology of islets plays a significant role in beta cell function. The present study was designed for better understanding the morphology, composition and distribution of islets in different parts of the pancreas and its impact on beta cell proportion. Methods: We observed islet morphology and beta cell area proportion by Large-scale computer-assisted analysis in 20 adult human pancreases in non-diabetic Indian population. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-synaptophysin and anti-insulin antibody was used to detect islet and beta cells respectively. Whole slide images were analyzed using ImageJ software. Results: Endocrine proportion were heterogeneously increasing from head to tail with maximum islet and beta cell distribution in the tail region. Larger islets were predominately confined to the tail region. The islets in Indian population were relatively smaller in size, but they have more beta cells (20%) when compared to American population. Interpretation &amp; conclusions: The beta cells of larger islets are functionally more active than the smaller islets via paracrine effect. Thus, reduction in the number of larger islets may be one of the probable reasons for increased susceptibility of Indians to diabetes even at lower BMI. Knowledge about the regional distribution of islets will help the surgeons to preserve the islet rich regions during surgery.","39":"Instant Blood-Mediated Inflammatory Reaction (IBMIR) is a major cause of graft loss during pancreatic islet transplantation, leading to a low efficiency of this treatment method and significantly limiting its broader clinical use. Within the procedure, transplanted islets obstruct intrahepatic portal vein branches and consequently restrict blood supply of downstream lying liver tissue, resulting typically in ischemic necrosis. The extent of ischemic lesions is influenced by mechanical obstruction and inflammation, as well as subsequent recanalization and regeneration capacity of recipient liver tissue. Monitoring of immediate liver perfusion impairment, which is directly related to the intensity of post-transplant inflammation and thrombosis (IBMIR), is essential for improving therapeutic and preventive strategies to improve overall islet graft survival. In this study, we present a new experimental model enabling direct quantification of liver perfusion impairment after pancreatic islet transplantation using ligation of hepatic arteries followed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ligation of hepatic arteries prevents the contrast agent from circumventing the portal vein obstruction and enables to discriminate between well-perfused and non-perfused liver tissue. Here we demonstrate that the extent of liver ischemia reliably reflects the number of transplanted islets. This model represents a useful tool for in vivo monitoring of biological effect of IBMIR-alleviating interventions as well as other experiments related to liver ischemia. This technical paper introduces a novel technique and its first application in experimental animals.","40":null,"41":"The intestinal microbiota has been demonstrated to influence host metabolism, and has been proposed to affect the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), possibly through short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by fermentation of dietary fiber. There are some indications that SCFAs inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rodents, but research on this subject is sparse. However, it has been reported that receptors for SCFAs, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) and FFAR3 are expressed not only on gut endocrine cells secreting GLP-1 and PYY, but also on pancreatic islet cells. We hypothesized that SCFAs might influence the endocrine secretion from pancreatic islets similar to their effects on the enteroendocrine cells. We studied this using isolated perfused mouse pancreas which responded adequately to changes in glucose and to infusions of arginine. None of the SCFAs, acetate, propionate and butyrate, influenced glucagon secretion, whereas they had weak inhibitory effects on somatostatin and insulin secretion. Infusions of two specific agonists of FFAR2 and FFAR3, CFMB and Compound 4, respectively, did not influence the pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas both induced strong increases in the secretion of somatostatin. In conclusion, the small effects of acetate, propionate and butyrate we observed here may not be physiologically relevant, but the effects of CFMB and Compound 4 on somatostatin secretion suggest that it may be possible to manipulate pancreatic secretion pharmacologically with agonists of the FFAR2 and 3 receptors, a finding which deserves further investigation.","42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":"The aim of the study was to determine the acute contribution of fuel oxidation in mediating the increase in insulin secretion rate (ISR) in response to fatty acids. Measures of mitochondrial metabolism, as reflected by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and cytochrome c reduction, calcium signaling, and ISR by rat islets were used to evaluate processes stimulated by acute exposure to palmitic acid (PA). The contribution of mitochondrial oxidation of PA was determined in the presence and absence of a blocker of mitochondrial transport of fatty acids (etomoxir) at different glucose concentrations. Subsequent to increasing glucose from 3 to 20 mM, PA caused small increases in OCR and cytosolic calcium (about 20% of the effect of glucose). In contrast, the effect of PA on ISR was almost 3 times that by glucose, suggesting that the metabolism of PA is not the dominant mechanism mediating PA's effect on ISR. This was further supported by lack of inhibition of PA-stimulated OCR and ISR when blocking entry of PA into mitochondria (with etomoxir), and PA's lack of stimulation of reduced cytochrome c in the presence of high glucose. Consistent with the lack of metabolic stimulation by PA, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but not a blocker of L-type calcium channels, abolished the PA-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium. Notably, ISR was unaffected by thapsigargin showing the dissociation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and second phase insulin secretion. In conclusion, stimulation of ISR by PA was mediated by mechanisms largely independent of the oxidation of the fuel.","47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":"Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia syndrome (HIHG) is a rare complication of roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The pathology is associated with an excessive function of pancreatic beta-cells, and requires pancreas resection in patients that are recalcitrant to nutritional and pharmacological interventions. The exact prevalence is not clearly understood and the underlying mechanisms not yet fully characterized. We herein sought to perform histological and molecular examination of pancreatic sections obtained from a patient who developed HIHG as a complication of gastric bypass compared to 3 weight-matched controls. We studied markers of cellular replication and beta-cell differentiation by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. HIHG after gastric bypass was characterized by a profound increase in beta-cell mass. Cellular proliferation was increased in islets and ducts compared to controls, suggesting unrestrained proliferation in HIHG. We also detected beta-cell differentiation markers in duct cells and occasional duct cells displaying both insulin and glucagon immunoreactivity. These histological observations suggest that beta-cell differentiation from ductal progenitor cells could also underly beta-cell mass expansion in HIHG. Altogether, our results can be construed to demonstrate that HIHG after gastric bypass is characterized by abnormal beta-cell mass expansion, resulting from both unrestrained beta-cell replication and neogenesis.","54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":"Intraportal islet transplantation has proven to be efficacious in preventing severe hypoglycemia and restoring insulin independence in selected patients with type 1 diabetes.

Contributions to graft loss include the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, potent host auto- and alloimmune responses, and beta cell toxicity from immunosuppressive agents. Protective strategies are being tested to circumvent several of these events including exploration of alternative transplantation sites, stem cell-derived insulin producing cell therapies, co-transplantation with mesenchymal stem cells or exploration of novel immune protective agents.

To solve this issue, cryopreservation of islets may offer the potential to bank islets for transplant on demand. Cryopreservation, however, introduces an overwhelmingly harsh environment to the ever-so-fragile islets. After exposure to the freezing and thawing, islets are usually either apoptotic, non-functional, or non-viable. Several studies have proposed various techniques that could lead to increased cell survival and function following a deep freeze. The purpose of this article is to critically review the techniques of islet cryopreservation, with the goal of highlighting optimization parameters that can lead to the most viable and functional islet upon recovery and\/or transplant.","71":null,"72":"The contribution of environmental factors to pancreatic islet damage in type 1 diabetes remains poorly understood.

After weaning, NOD8.3+ female offspring were identified and maintained on the same parental feeding regimen for until day 28 of life. A low AGE diet, from conception to early postnatal life, decreased circulating AGE concentrations in the female offspring when compared to a high AGE diet. Insulin, proinsulin and glucagon secretion were greater in islets isolated from offspring in the low AGE diet group, which was akin to age matched non-diabetic C57BL\/6 mice. Pancreatic islet expression of Ins2 gene was also higher in offspring from the low AGE diet group. Islet expression of glucagon, AGEs and the AGE receptor RAGE, were each reduced in low AGE fed offspring. Islet immune cell infiltration was also decreased in offspring exposed to a low AGE diet. Within pancreatic lymph nodes and spleen, the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not differ between groups. There were no significant changes in body weight, fasting glucose or glycemic hormones. This study demonstrates that reducing exposure to dietary AGEs throughout gestation, lactation and early postnatal life may benefit pancreatic islet secretion and immune infiltration in the type 1 diabetic susceptible mouse strain, NOD8.3.","73":null,"74":null,"75":"One factor that may contribute to variability between different lots of purified collagenase to recover islets is the molecular form of C. histolyticum class I (C1) collagenase used in the isolation procedure.

Its success rates have increased lately based on improvements in immunosuppressive therapies and on islet isolation and culture. It is known that the quality and quantity of viable transplanted islets are crucial for the achievement of insulin independence and some studies have shown that a significant number of islets are lost during culture time. Thus, in an effort to improve islet yield during culture period, researchers have tested a variety of additives in culture media as well as alternative culture devices, such as scaffolds. However, due to the use of different categories of additives or devices, it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the benefits of these strategies. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarize the results of studies that described the use of medium additives, scaffolds or extracellular matrix (ECM) components during human pancreatic islets culture. PubMed and Embase repositories were searched. Of 5083 articles retrieved, a total of 37 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the review.

Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the effect of different culture contact systems of islets with MSCs on viability and insulin secretion outcomes. Pubmed and Embase were searched. Twenty studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis and\/or meta-analysis. For both outcomes, pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) between islet cultured alone (control group) and the co-culture condition were calculated. Viability mean was higher in islets co-cultured with MSCs compared with islet cultured alone [WMD = 18.08 (95% CI 12.59-23.57)]. The improvement in viability was higher in islets co-cultured in indirect or mixed contact with MSCs than in direct physical contact (P &lt;0.001). Moreover, the mean of insulin stimulation index (ISI) was higher in islets from co-culture condition compared with islet cultured alone [WMD = 0.83 (95% CI 0.54-1.13)], independently of contact system. Results from the studies that were analyzed only qualitatively are in accordance with meta-analysis data.

Primary organization of islets and acini occurred during the developmental period examined. Differentiating endocrine and exocrine cells developed from the ductal tubules and subsequently formed isolated small clusters. Extracellular matrix fibers and proteins accumulated around newly differentiated cells during their migration and cluster formation. Glycogen expression was robust in ductal cells of the pancreas from 8-15 weeks of fetal age; however, this became markedly reduced at 20 weeks, with a concomitant increase in acinar cell glycogen content. Insulin secretory granules transformed from being dense and round at 8 weeks to distinct geometric (multilobular, crystalline) structures by 14-20 weeks. Initially many of the differentiating endocrine cells were multihormonal and contained polyhormonal granules; by 20 weeks, monohormonal cells were in the majority. Interestingly, certain secretory granules in the early human fetal pancreatic cells showed positivity for both exocrine (amylase) and endocrine proteins.

In this study we have defined the profile of NEUROG3 detection in the developing pancreas to give insight into when NEUROG3-dependent endocrine commitment is possible in the human fetus. Immunohistochemistry allowed counting of cells with positively stained nuclei from 7 wpc through to term. mRNA was also isolated from sections of human fetal pancreas and NEUROG3 transcription analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. NEUROG3 was detected as expected at 8 wpc. The number of NEUROG3-positive cells increased to peak levels between 10 wpc and 14 wpc.

Analysis of NEUROG3 transcription corroborated this profile by demonstrating very low levels of transcript at 35-41 wpc, more than 10-fold lower than levels at 12-16 wpc. These data define the appearance, peak and subsequent disappearance of the critical transcription factor, NEUROG3, in human fetal pancreas for the first time.

Neonatal porcine islets (NPIs) were embedded in collagen matrices crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide containing combinations of chondroitin-6-sulfate, chitosan, and laminin, and compared with controls cultured in standard media.

A marginal islet mass with or without BOEC was grafted underneath the kidney capsule of diabetic recipient mice via a (blood clot-independent) tubing system and compared with previous islet packing in a blood clot. The effect on metabolic outcome of both delivery techniques as well as the additive effect of BOEC was subsequently evaluated. Marginal islet mass transplantation via a tubing system required more islets per recipient than via a blood clot. Using the tubing method, transplantation of a marginal islet mass combined with 5x10 (5) BOEC resulted in reversal of hyperglycemia, improved glucose tolerance and increased kidney insulin content. The present study provides evidence that (1) previous packing in a blood clot results in more effective islet delivery compared with tubing; (2) BOEC exert a beneficial effect on marginal islet transplantation, independent of grafting technique and potential blood clot-induced processes.

The effect of palmitic acid on superoxide production and insulin secretion by INS-1E cells and the possible involvement of GPR40 and NADPH oxidase in these processes were examined in this study. Cells were incubated during 1 h with palmitic acid in low and high glucose concentrations, a GPR40 agonist (GW9508) and inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium, DPI) and PKC (calphostin C). GW9508 induced superoxide production at 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose concentrations and stimulated insulin secretion at 16.7 mM glucose concentration involving both PKC and NADPH oxidase activation. Palmitic acid induced superoxide production through NADPH oxidase and GPR40-dependent pathways and the stimulation of insulin secretion in the presence of a high glucose concentration was reduced by knockdown of GPR40 using siRNA. Our results suggest that palmitic acid induces superoxide production and potentiates GSIS through NADPH oxidase and GPR40 pathways in pancreatic ? cells.

Product refinement and alterations to the application strategies have improved isolation outcomes over time; however, islet utilization from donor organs remains low. In this study we evaluate a low endotoxin-high activity grade neutral protease in clinical islet isolation. The use of a non-collagenolytic enzyme, either thermolysin or high active neutral protease, was randomized in clinical islet isolations to evaluate efficacy. Additionally a retrospective comparison to neutral protease NB was conducted. The thermolysin group had lower trapped islet population and increased purity and post-culture islet mass in comparison to high active grade neutral protease. Comparison of neutral protease NB GMP grade to high active neutral protease displayed no measurable difference in islet mass or viability and transplantation outcomes at 1 mo post-transplant were favorable for both groups. High activity neutral protease can generate clinical grade islets and may prove beneficial to islet function and viability based on a reduced endotoxin load but dosing of neutral protease requires ongoing optimization.

Previously, it has reported that the significant loss of isolated islet mass could be prevented by sphingolipid metabolite, sphinogosine 1-phophate (S1P). This study was performed to elucidate whether the beneficial effects of S1P maintaining isolated pancreatic islets ex vivo are mimicked by modulation of intracellular S1P. We tested the in vitro effect of various agents that modulate intracellular S1P levels in insulinoma cell lines and isolated islets to compare their anti-apoptotic effects with that of S1P. As results, we discovered that 4-deoxypyridoxine (DOP), which inhibits the degradation of intracellular S1P by inhibiting S1P lyase (SPL) activity, minimized the chemically induced apoptosis of insulinoma cell lines as S1P did. Also, supplementation of DOP in the culture media protected the regression of isolated islets that have been maintained ex vivo at least for 18 h providing the evidence of increasing viability of isolated islets with DOP, which impaired SPL activity. In conclusion, these results suggest that the application of SPL inhibitors could be considered as a supplement for the maintenance of viable islets isolated from donor sources in the process of islet transplantation.","161":null,"162":"Advances in islet transplantation research have led to remarkable improvements in the outcome in humans with type 1 diabetes.

This review discusses the main shortcomings of the mouse models currently used in islet transplantation research, outlining the main factors and variables to take into account for the design of new preclinical studies.

In this study, we examined whether the new bottle purification method could improve the purification of human islets. Nine human pancreata from brain-dead donors were used.

Islet yield, purity, recovery rate after purification, and in vitro and in vivo viability were compared. Islet yield per pancreas weight (IE\/g) and the recovery rate in the top group were significantly higher than in the COBE and bottom groups. Furthermore, the average size of purified islets in the top group was significantly larger than in the COBE group, which indicated that the bottle method could reduce the shear force to the islets.

Expression of the protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in endocrine pancreas from six patients and in various EPTs from 51 patients. In pancreatic islets, virtually all insulin, approx. 75% of the somatostatin, and approx. 60% of the pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells were immunoreactive for the CCDC116 protein whereas glucagon, ghrelin and the exocrine cells were not. All insulinomas, gastrinomas, non-functioning sporadic tumors and the hereditary multihormonal EPTs were immunoreactive with variable relative incidence. Two of the three somatostatinomas, and one of the three ACTH-secreting tumors also expressed CCDC116. The CCDC116 protein is expressed in all islet cell types except the glucagon and ghrelin cells.

In the present study, we have investigated AC3 expression in pancreatic islets, striatum and hypothalamus of GK rats to evaluate its role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. GK and Wistar rats at the age of 2.5 mo were used. A group of GK rats were implanted with sustained insulin release chips for 15 d. Plasma glucose and serum insulin levels were measured. AC3 gene expression levels in pancreatic islets, striatum and hypothalamus were determined by using real-time RT-PCR. Results indicated that plasma glucose levels in Wistar rats were found to be similar to insulin-treated GK rats, and significantly lower compared with non-treated GK rats. AC3 expression levels in pancreatic islets, striatum and hypothalamus of GK rats were higher compared with Wistar rats, while the levels were intermediate in insulin-treated GK rats. The AC3 expression display patterns between pancreatic islets and striatum-hypothalamus were similar. The present study thus provides the first evidence that AC3 is overexpressed in the regions of striatum and hypothalamus of brain, and similarly in pancreatic islets of GK rats suggesting that AC3 plays a role in regulation of glucose homeostasis via CNS and insulin secretion.","187":"The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), as with several other autoimmune diseases and conditions, began to notably rise in the latter half of the last century.

Although human enteroviruses (HEV) have been strongly implicated as causative environmental agents of T1D, recent work has shown that the bacterial genera in the gut of diabetics compared with non-diabetics, can vary significantly.

First, animals were divided into two groups: sedentary (S) and aerobic trained (T). At the end of 8 weeks, half of them (S and T) were submitted to an acute exercise session (exercise until exhaustion), being subdivided as acute sedentary (AS) and acute trained (AT). After the experimental period, periepididymal, retroperitoneal and subcutaneous fat pads, blood, soleus muscle and pancreatic islets were collected and prepared for further analysis. From the pancreatic islets, total insulin content, insulin secretion stimulated by glucose, leucine, arginine and carbachol were analyzed. Our results pointed that body adiposity and glucose homeostasis improved with chronic physical exercise. In addition, total insulin content was reduced in group AT, insulin secretion stimulated by glucose was reduced in trained groups (T and AT) and insulin secretion stimulated by carbachol was increased in group AT. There were no significant differences in insulin secretion stimulated by arginine and leucine.

Then, to assess the distribution of collagenase, human pancreata were classified into two groups: without DI (no DI, n = 5) and with DI at the procurement site (DI, n = 5). Collagenase with 1% marking dye was perfused in the same manner as in our clinical isolation. The distension of the pancreas and the microscopic distribution of the dyed collagenase in pancreas sections were examined. For microscopic analysis, islets were counted and classified into three criteria: unreached, dye didn't reach the islet surface; surface, dye resided on the surface of the islet but not inside; and inside, dye was found inside the islet. As a result, DI groups substantially improved islet yields. In addition, Liberase MTF with DI significantly improved efficacy of pancreas digestion. All pancreata were well distended macroscopically. However, microscopically, the majority of islets in the no DI group were untouched by the dyed collagenase. Ductal preservation substantially improved dyed collagenase delivery on the surface of islets. In conclusion, delivery of collagenase on the surface of islets was unexpectedly insufficient without DI, which was substantially improved by DI. Thus, ductal preservation is a potent method to improve collagenase delivery and islet yields.","209":null,"210":null,"211":"The human body needs continuous and stable glucose supply for maintaining its biological functions.

Animals were transplanted with 500 islets and observed at 1, 4, 8 and 16 weeks post transplantation.

The quantity of endocrine tissue staining positive for insulin correlated with graft function at 8 and 16 weeks. However, at 1 and 4 weeks, islet tissue was not evidently visible as observed by endocrine staining. All islet tissue showed dense vascularization and sporadic sympathetic innervation, irrespective of the graft's function. Immunopositive cells for Cytokeratin-7 and -19 were observed in the grafts at early time points and hormone producing cells appear to have been differentiated from these progenitors.

It has been presumed that islets with smaller diameter, and therefore smaller diffusion distance, are superior to large islets regarding early survival rate and graft function. In this study we aimed to evaluate Complex Object Parametric Analysis and Sorting (COPAS) as a device for automated sorting of human islets. The use of COPAS was validated for accuracy and sensitivity using polystyrene beads of known diameters. Based on time of flight relative to particle isolated islets were then automatically sorted and analyzed for viability and function using handpicked islets as control. Our results suggest that COPAS enables the automated and accurate sorting of islets with no negative impact on their integrity and viability.

We transplanted syngeneic (BALB\/c mice) and xenogeneic (SD rats) islets into the renal subcapsular space of diabetic mice. The recipient mice were examined by HF-US until post-operative day (POD) 28 and, while syngeneic islets could be detected by HF-US throughout the observational period, the xenogeneic islets had vanished by POD 28.

Since islet cells are very poor in their antioxidant defense, our interest was to assess their antioxidant profile under normal, diabetic, insulin treated diabetic and untreated diabetic condition. On one hand, antioxidant defense was measured in terms of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant molecules while on the other, damage caused to biomolecules was estimated.

Assessment of graft function was made by measuring blood glucose concentrations using a wireless continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM), performing a glucose tolerance test (GTT), and histological analysis. To determine if bone tissue secretes factors supportive to islet function and survival, human islets were cultured in the presence of osteoblast conditioned medium. Gene expression, insulin secretion and content were assessed in islets after culture. All transplant recipients with islets transplanted to the bone marrow cavity site had reversal of hyperglycemia and remained diabetes free until the end of the experiment at four months. Mean blood glucose concentrations, glucose variability and GTT, using CGM in recipients, yielded similar results between all transplantation sites. Histological assessments at four months after transplantation showed viable islets within the bone marrow space. Incubation of human islets in the presence of osteoblast conditioned medium resulted in positive changes in gene expression, insulin secretion and content. These positive changes were mediated by osteocalcin which was present in the conditioned medium. In summary, islets transplanted to the bone marrow cavity in diabetic rats showed good engraftment.

Untreated or transfected islets were placed in polyacrylonitrile-polyvinychloride hollow fiber and implanted beneath the hepatic capsule in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Fasting blood glucose was used as an indicator of islet survival and function. Rats receiving fibers containing transfected islets remained normoglycemic through the 60 day trial. Untreated islets failed within two weeks after implantation resulting in elevated blood glucose in the recipient. The fibers were recovered and tested for insulin content. Cytoglobin promoted islet cell survival and insulin synthesis and secretion. The induction of cytoglobin in islets may reduce cell loss from chronic hypoxia and may be a useful method to improve the feasibility of immunoisolation as an islet transplantation modality.","269":"Close cellular proximity and correct anatomical arrangement within islets are essential for normal patterns of insulin secretion.

Such studies have highlighted the functional importance of cell adhesion molecules and connexins. Pseudoislets comprising insulin-secreting cell lines have been shown to closely mimic primary islets in both size and morphology, displaying a significantly enhanced response to glucose, nutrients and drugs over equivalent monolayer cultures.

The translational impact of these observations were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging of autotransplanted islets in the forearm muscle of pancreactomized patients, and higher blood perfusion of the grafts compared to adjacent muscle were found. In summary, the striated muscle is a promising site for islet transplantation which promotes full revascularization of implanted grafts.

Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to possible functional differences between islet subpopulations until recently. We demonstrated that one population, the small islets, were superior to large islets in a number of functional aspects. However, that work did not determine whether these differences were inherent, or whether they arose because of the challenge of isolation procedures. Nor, were there data to explain the differences in insulin secretion. We utilized immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and transmission electron microscopy to compare the unique characteristics found in isolated rat islet populations in situ and after isolation. Insulin secretion of small isolated islets was significantly higher compared to large islets, which correlated with higher insulin content\/area in small islets (in situ), a higher density of insulin secretory granules, and greater insulin content\/volume in isolated islets. Specifically, the core b-cells of the large islets contained less insulin\/cell with a lower insulin granule density than peripheral b-cells. When insulin secretion was normalized for total insulin content, large and small islets released the same percentage of total insulin. Small islets had a higher density of cells\/area than large islets in vitro and in situ. The data provide a possible explanation for the inferior insulin secretion from large islets, as they have a lower total cell density and the b-cells of the core contain less insulin\/cell.","275":null,"276":null,"277":"Islet yield is a critical parameter to determine clinical use of isolated islets.

For SI-GSIRT, an individual islet was classified by its diameter from the area of a digital image and calculated IEQ. Each single islet was incubated with low glucose followed by high glucose solutions. Insulin secretions by SI-GSIRT were compared based on diameter of islets. There was a significantly strong correlation between insulin secretion stimulated by high glucose solution and low glucose solution (R(2) =0.90, p&lt; 0.001) confirming our technical applicability for SI-GSIRT. Insulin secretion stimulated by high glucose per IEQ was significantly lower in larger islets compared to smaller islets. This means that one IEQ from a large islet secretes less insulin than one IEQ from a small islet. In conclusion, we developed SI-GSIRT to evaluate single islets. This method revealed that large human islets secrete less insulin per IEQ. Thus the distribution of islet size must be monitored when the glucose stimulation test is conducted.","278":"Pancreatic islet dysfunction is a key element in the development of type 2 diabetes. Determining possible early warning signs of dysfunction is thus important to determining the underlying causes of diabetes. We describe an improved fluorescent imaging approach to detect potential islet dysfunction. Using Cell Tracker Red (CTR, a mildly thiol-reactive fluorescent probe) to positively label particular islets, we measured intracellular free calcium with fura-2 AM in both CTR-labeled and unlabeled sets of pancreatic islets simultaneously in vitro. This approach enhances sensitivity by controlling for differences in background fluorescence, temperature, and perifusion dynamics. We confirmed that 200 nM CTR produced no spectral overlap with fura-2 and no significant physiological effects in selective tests of islet function. To demonstrate the utility of dual-labeling, we compared untreated islets with islets pretreated with low-dose pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 + IL-1B) to induce mild dysfunction. We alternated CTR-labeling between control and test islets and identified consistent reductions in the amplitude and trajectory of glucose-stimulated calcium responses (GSCa) among cytokine-treated islets that were independent of labeling. Observations were verified using a MATLAB program specifically designed to identify key features in the GSCa. Our findings thus demonstrate the utility of CTR-labeling in identifying islet dysfunction and propose that this technique can be adapted for other cells and tissues.","279":null,"280":"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disorder that results due to auto immune destruction of insulin producing cells, which leads to hyperglycemia in the blood.

The presence of gelatin and PVP in GPE and GPG scaffolds was confirmed through FTIR and TGA. The medium uptake ability of GPE and GPG scaffolds were higher than GG and GE scaffolds. The scaffolds were then analyzed for its ability to maintain the viability and function of mouse pancreatic islet cells in vitro. The results showed that the islets can adhere, but it tends to lose the structure and function on all the scaffolds after day 7, except on GPE where they remained intact up to day 30. Thus the present study clearly demonstrates that gelatin incorporated with PVP and cross linked with EDC scaffolds could support and maintain islet cells for prolonged period.","281":null,"282":"The sophistication of intracellular Ca ( 2+) signalling reflects the necessity for the many different types of cells to fine tuning their specific activities. This can, at least in part, be explained by the molecular complexity of the Ca ( 2+) signalling machinery, consisting of different intracellular Ca ( 2+) release channel types, each including multiple isoforms and alternative splicing variants. This commentary will go over the main points concerning expression and functional characterization of alternative splicing variants of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor isoforms. Many of these variants display specific activation or regulatory features. In addition, dominant negative effects of non-functional alternative splicing variants have been also described for both InsP3Rs and RyRs channels. Recently, a novel RyR2 transcript has been identified by Takasawa and co-workers in pancreatic islets. This novel RyR2 transcript has been proposed to act as an intracellular target for cADPR signalling, which has been demonstrated to be important for insulin secretion. Future characterization of this RyR2 transcript may represent a significant advancement in understanding the mechanisms underlying regulation of Ca ( 2+) release by cADPR.","283":null,"284":null,"285":null,"286":null,"287":null,"288":null,"289":null,"290":null,"291":null,"292":null,"293":null,"294":null,"295":null,"296":null,"297":null,"298":null,"299":"Islet transplantation is a safe and effective procedure; however, it depends on the critical step of isolating high quality of islets from whole pancreas.

The other half was kept sedentary (sedentary). At the end of the experimental period, the rats were submitted to an oral glucose tolerance test and to another LMT. Then, the animals were sacrificed at rest or immediately after 20 minutes of swimming exercise at the AT intensity for pancreatic islets isolation. At the end of the experiment mean workload (% bw) at AT was higher and blood lactate concentration (mmol\/L) was lower in the trained than in the control group.

Islet insulin content of trained rats was higher than in the sedentary rats while islet glucose uptake did not differ among the groups. The static insulin secretion in response to the high glucose concentration (16.7 mM) of the sedentary group at rest was lower than the sedentary group submitted to the acute exercise and the inverse was observed in relation to the trained groups.

Islet dysfunction underlies both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); its protection from immune attack and gluco-and lipo-toxicity may prevent the development of DM; and its replacement by non-surgical transplantation may be curative of DM. During a career marked by vision, focus and tenacity, Paul Lacy contributed substantially to the development of each of these concepts. In this review we focus on Lacy's contribution to the development of the concept of the islet as a micro-organ, how this foreshadowed our current detailed understanding of single cell function and cell-cell interactions and how this led to a reduced model of islet function encouraging islet transplantation. Next, we examine how clinical allotransplantation, first undertaken by Lacy, has contributed to a more complex view of the interaction of islet endocrine cells with its circulation and neighboring tissues, both \"in situ\" and after transplantation. Lastly, we consider recent developments in some alternative approaches to treatment of DM that Lacy could glimpse on the horizon but did not have the chance to participate in.","307":"","308":"Pefabloc, Trasylol and Urinary Trypsin Inhibitor (UTI) have been reported to be effective serine protease inhibitors that impair pancreatic endogenous proteases resulting in improved islet yield. Here we evaluated the effect of these inhibitors on endogenous proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase), bacterial neutral proteases (thermolysin and neutral protease) and islet isolation digestion samples. Protease activity was measured using a fluorimetric assay and islet function was assessed by dynamic perifusion. Trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase were significantly inhibited by Pefabloc and UTI. Trasylol showed strong inhibitory effects on trypsin and chymotrypsin but also decreased thermolysin activity. UTI was found to inhibit the activity of endogenous proteases and increase the activity of bacterial neutral proteases. Human islets exposed to Pefabloc had reduced insulin response, unlike Trasylol or UTI, which had no detrimental effect on insulin secretion. Although Trasylol was an effective inhibitor of endogenous proteases, FDA regulatory issues preclude its use in clinical application and thus in the isolation process. UTI has the greatest potential because it impairs endogenous pancreatic proteases and enhances digestion enzymes.","309":null,"310":null,"311":null,"312":null,"313":null,"314":"As embryonic development of the pancreas progresses, a wide range of congenital anomalies and variations can occur.

The human umbilical cord has been shown to be a reservoir of multipotent stem cells with capacity to differentiate into ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages. The present investigation deals with isolation and characterization of mesenchymal stem sells (MSC) derived from human umbilical cord and their differentiation into functional islets. Since these MSCs were found to constitutively express nestin we hypothesized that these would be ideal candidates for islet neogenesis without any further manipulation. Human umbilical cord matrix stem cells (hUCMSCs) were found to express CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, smooth muscle actin, nestin, vimentin, proliferation marker Ki67 and embryonic markers Oct4, SSEA4. These were found to be negative for CD33, CD34, CD45 and HLA DR. Human UCMSCs exhibited high proliferating capacity for extended period indicating potential for scaling up. When subjected to a cocktail of specific differentiating factors, these cells differentiated into fat, cartilage, bone, neurons and islet like clusters (ILCs). These ILCs stained positive for diphenylthiocarbazone (DTZ) and expressed human C-peptide, insulin and glucagon. Real time qPCR analysis of newly generated islets further demonstrated abundance of Pdx-1, Ngn3, insulin, glucagon and somatostatin transcripts. On transplantation in experimental diabetic mice these ILCs restored normoglycemia, body weight and exhibited normal glucose tolerance test indicating their functional status.

MiRNAs regulate gene expression mainly by binding to the 3' UTR of mRNAs and thereby inhibit the translation of target mRNAs. The abundance of many miRNAs is altered under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Recent data suggest that miRNAs also have an important role in regulation of insulin gene transcription, insulin secretion, and pancreatic islet cell function. An interesting study by Joglekar et al. published in this issue of ISLETS suggests that the miR-30 family of miRNAs may control the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of primary cultures of human pancreatic epithelial cells by negatively regulating the translation of mesenchymal gene transcripts such as vimentin. These findings are in agreement with previous data that suggest an important role for one of the miR-30 family members (miR-30d) in insulin gene expression in pancreatic beta cells. In summary, the report by Joglekar et al provides a significant advancement in understanding the role of miRNAs in pancreatic islet development and suggests that manipulation of miR-30 family of miRNA expression may provide an important means to generate and expand pancreatic beta cells from human fetal pancreatic progenitors.","337":null,"338":null,"339":null,"340":null,"341":null,"342":null,"343":"Fifteen thousand youths are diagnosed yearly with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Using Thioflavin T fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy, we found that all dicyclic and tricyclic compounds in our screen were efficient inhibitors of insulin fibril formation. A common notion regarding amyloid inhibitors is that two functional groups are essentials for interfering with the amyloid formation process; a recognition motif and a bulky group for inducing a steric interference. However, here, we showed that some monocyclic compounds as small as toluene were also found to inhibit fibrillization. In addition, we found that substituent of benzene ring have a great influence on the inhibitory potency. Specifically, cyano, methyl and nitro groups increased the inhibitory potency. The results introduced here may contribute to future rational design of amyloid inhibitors.","349":null,"350":null,"351":"Diabetes is a predominant metabolic disorder in the industrialized nations. Since pancreatic islets play a key role in type I and type II diabetes, the isolation of islets from pancreatic tissues represents an important step in diabetes research. However, to date, only a small fraction of all islets, resident within any given pancreas, are harvested by using currently available enzyme blends. This holds true for islet isolation from both the mouse and the human pancreas. In the present study, the newly developed Liberase TL Research Grade was compared to the widely used Liberase RI to investigate the effect of increased collagenase purity on islet yield. The study shows that reducing the degradation products of collagenases during Liberase production significantly increases the number of islets isolated from the mouse pancreas by 28%, and, therefore, is expected to lower the numbers of mice and resulting costs for diabetes research accordingly. Furthermore, this study also points to a possibility to increase the number and mass of islets isolated from human pancreases, for which only a limited donor pool exists.","352":null,"353":"It has long been believed that heavy metals possess many adverse health effects.

Expression of 165 genes were significantly changed in HUH7-ins,though interestingly the majority of secretory granule associated genes, such as the chromogranins were unchanged. CgA was over-expressed in glucose unresponsive HUH7-ins cells to test whether CgA played a role in SGB and would restore the regulated secretory phenotype.

This particular species difference has raised concerns regarding the interpretation of data based on rodent studies to humans. On the other hand, further variations have been reported in marsupials and some nonhuman primates, which possess an inverted ratio of beta-cells to other endocrine cells. This review discusses the striking plasticity of islet architecture and cellular composition among various species including changes in response to metabolic states within a single species. We propose that this plasticity reflects evolutionary acquired adaptation induced by altered physiological conditions, rather than inherent disparities between species.","369":"The gonadal steroid, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), acts as a protective hormone preventing beta-cell apoptosis in vivo in mice of both sexes and in cultured mouse and human islets. E(2) signals via the classical estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and ERbeta, an extranuclear form of ERalpha and the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). In a recent study, we determined the contribution of these receptors to beta-cell survival, using a combination of genetic and pharmacological tools in mice and cultured mouse and human islets. We showed that E(2) favors islet survival by preventing apoptosis via ERalpha and ERbeta through ERE-independent, extra-nuclear mechanisms and with a predominant ERalpha effect. We also revealed that E(2) prevents apoptosis via GPER-dependent mechanisms. Here, we show that E(2) prevents apoptosis independently of gene transcription or de novo protein synthesis suggesting that E(2) cytoprotection happens independently of nuclear events. Furthermore, we report that E(2) islet cytoprotection can be mimicked by the nonfeminizing E(2) stereoisomer, 17alpha-estradiol, suggesting that it is partially non-estrogen receptor mediated.

We also examined the islets of monkeys, pigs, rabbits and birds for further comparisons. Despite differences in overall body and pancreas size as well as total beta-cell mass among these species, the distribution of their islet sizes closely overlaps, except in the bird pancreas in which the delta-cell population predominates (both in singlets and clusters) along with a small number of islets. Markedly large islets (&gt;10,000 mum(2)) were observed in human and monkey islets as well as in islets from ob\/ob and pregnant mice. The fraction of alpha-, beta- and delta-cells within an islet varied between islets in all the species examined. Furthermore, there was variability in the distribution of alpha- and delta-cells within the same species. In summary, human and mouse islets share common architectural features that may reflect demand for insulin.
