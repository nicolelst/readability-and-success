metal batteries based on lithium, sodium, and potassium anodes and sulfur-based cathodes are regarded as key for next-generation energy storage due to their high theoretical energy and potential cost effectiveness. However, metal-sulfur batteries remain challenged by several factors, including polysulfides' (PSs) dissolution, sluggish sulfur redox kinetics at the cathode, and metallic dendrite growth at the anode. Functional separators and interlayers are an innovative approach to remedying these drawbacks. Here we critically review the state-of-the-art in separators\/interlayers for cathode and anode protection, covering the Li-S and the emerging Na-S and K-S systems. The approaches for improving electrochemical performance may be categorized as one or a combination of the following: Immobilization of polysulfides (cathode); catalyzing sulfur redox kinetics (cathode); introduction of protective layers to serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) (anode); and combined improvement in electrolyte wetting and homogenization of ion flux (anode and cathode). It is demonstrated that while the advances in Li-S are relatively mature, less progress has been made with Na-S and K-S due to the more challenging redox chemistry at the cathode and increased electrochemical instability at the anode. Throughout these sections there is a complementary discussion of functional separators for emerging alkali metal systems based on metal-selenium and the metal-selenium sulfide. The focus then shifts to interlayers and artificial SEI\/cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers employed to stabilize solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in metal-sulfur solid-state batteries (SSBs). The discussion of SSEs focuses on inorganic electrolytes based on Li- and Na-based oxides and sulfides but also touches on some hybrid systems with an inorganic matrix and a minority polymer phase. The review then moves to practical considerations for functional separators, including scaleup issues and Li-S technoeconomics. The review concludes with an outlook section, where we discuss emerging mechanics, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy (e.g. cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB))-based approaches for analysis of functional separator structure-battery electrochemical performance interrelations. Throughout the review we identify the outstanding open scientific and technological questions while providing recommendations for future research topics.","1":"In the past two decades, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) assembled from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers via metal-ligand coordination bonds have captivated significant scientific interest on account of their high crystallinity, exceptional porosity, and tunable pore size, high modularity, and diverse functionality. The opportunity to achieve functional porous materials by design with promising properties, unattainable for solid-state materials in general, distinguishes MOFs from other classes of materials, in particular, traditional porous materials such as activated carbon, silica, and zeolites, thereby leading to complementary properties. Scientists have conducted intense research in the production of chiral MOF (CMOF) materials for specific applications including but not limited to chiral recognition, separation, and catalysis since the discovery of the first functional CMOF (i.e., d- or l-POST-1). At present, CMOFs have become interdisciplinary between chirality chemistry, coordination chemistry, and material chemistry, which involve in many subjects including chemistry, physics, optics, medicine, pharmacology, biology, crystal engineering, environmental science, etc. In this review, we will systematically summarize the recent progress of CMOFs regarding design strategies, synthetic approaches, and cutting-edge applications. In particular, we will highlight the successful implementation of CMOFs in asymmetric catalysis, enantioselective separation, enantioselective recognition, and sensing. We envision that this review will provide readers a good understanding of CMOF chemistry and, more importantly, facilitate research endeavors for the rational design of multifunctional CMOFs and their industrial implementation.","2":"Nanocelluloses (NC) are nature-based sustainable biomaterials, which not only possess cellulosic properties but also have the important hallmarks of nanomaterials, such as large surface area, versatile reactive sites or functionalities, and scaffolding stability to host inorganic nanoparticles. This class of nanomaterials offers new opportunities for a broad spectrum of applications for clean water production that were once thought impractical. This Review covers substantial discussions based on evaluative judgments of the recent literature and technical advancements in the fields of coagulation\/flocculation, adsorption, photocatalysis, and membrane filtration for water decontamination through proper understanding of fundamental knowledge of NC, such as purity, crystallinity, surface chemistry and charge, suspension rheology, morphology, mechanical properties, and film stability. To supplement these, discussions on low-cost and scalable NC extraction, new characterizations including solution small-angle X-ray scattering evaluation, and structure-property relationships of NC are also reviewed. Identifying knowledge gaps and drawing perspectives could generate guidance to overcome uncertainties associated with the adaptation of NC-enabled water purification technologies. Furthermore, the topics of simultaneous removal of multipollutants disposal and proper handling of post\/spent NC are discussed. We believe NC-enabled remediation nanomaterials can be integrated into a broad range of water treatments, greatly improving the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of water purification.","3":"","4":"","5":"Mass spectrometry is a central technology in the life sciences, providing our most comprehensive account of the molecular inventory of the cell. In parallel with developments in mass spectrometry technologies targeting such assessments of cellular composition, mass spectrometry tools have emerged as versatile probes of biomolecular stability. In this review, we cover recent advancements in this branch of mass spectrometry that target proteins, a centrally important class of macromolecules that accounts for most biochemical functions and drug targets. Our efforts cover tools such as hydrogen-deuterium exchange, chemical cross-linking, ion mobility, collision induced unfolding, and other techniques capable of stability assessments on a proteomic scale. In addition, we focus on a range of application areas where mass spectrometry-driven protein stability measurements have made notable impacts, including studies of membrane proteins, heat shock proteins, amyloidogenic proteins, and biotherapeutics. We conclude by briefly discussing the future of this vibrant and fast-moving area of research.","6":"Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s or CB[n]s), as a classical of artificial organic macrocyclic hosts, were found to have excellent advantages in the fabricating of tunable and smart organic luminescent materials in aqueous media and the solid state with high emitting efficiency under the rigid pumpkin-shaped structure-derived macrocyclic-confinement effect in recent years. This review aims to give a systematically up-to-date overview of the Q[n]-based supramolecular organic luminescent emissions from the confined spaces triggered host-guest complexes, including the assembly fashions and the mechanisms of the macrocycle-based luminescent complexes, as well as their applications. Finally, challenges and outlook are provided. Since this class of Q[n]-based supramolecular organic luminescent emissions, which have essentially derived from the cavity-dependent confinement effect and the resulting assembly fashions, emerged only a few years ago, we hope this review will provide valuable information for the further development of macrocycle-based light-emitting materials and other related research fields.","7":null,"8":"The replacement of one or more pyrrolic building block(s) of a porphyrin by a nonpyrrolic heterocycle leads to the formation of so-called pyrrole-modified porphyrins (PMPs), porphyrinoids of broad structural variability. The wide range of coordination environments (type, number, charge, and architecture of the donor atoms) that the pyrrole-modified frameworks provide to the central metal ions, the frequent presence of donor atoms at their periphery, and their often observed nonplanarity or conformational flexibility distinguish the complexes of the PMPs clearly from those of the traditional square-planar, dianionic, N4-coordinating (hydro)porphyrins. Their different coordination properties suggest their utilization in areas beyond which regular metalloporphyrins are suitable. Following a general introduction to the synthetic methodologies available to generate pyrrole-modified porphyrins, their general structure, history, coordination chemistry, and optical properties, this Review highlights the chemical, electronic (optical), and structural differences of specific classes of metalloporphyrinoids containing nonpyrrolic heterocycles. The focus is on macrocycles with similar \"tetrapyrrolic\" architectures as porphyrins, thusly excluding the majority of expanded porphyrins. We highlight the relevance and application of these metal complexes in biological and technical fields as chemosensors, catalysts, photochemotherapeutics, or imaging agents. This Review provides an introduction to the field of metallo-PMPs as well as a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the art of their synthesis, structures, and properties. It also aims to provide encouragement for the further study of these intriguing and structurally versatile metalloporphyrinoids.","9":null,"10":"Electrochemical synthesis is a valuable method for the preparation of molecules. It is innately eco-friendly, as potentially hazardous oxidation and reduction agents are replaced with electrochemical potentials. Electrochemistry is commonly applied globally in the synthesis of numerous chemicals, but the energetic materials field lags in this regard. In this review, we endeavor to cover the entire history of synthetic electrochemistry for the preparation of energetic materials and detail the electrochemical transformations of high-nitrogen materials that are relevant for the preparation of new energetic molecules. We hope this review serves as a starting point to inform those involved in synthetic energetic materials chemistry, and those interested in other applications of high-nitrogen molecules, about the environmentally friendly electrochemical methods available for such compounds.","11":"Electron transfer is the most important electrochemical process. In this review, we present elements of various aspects of electron transfer theory from the early work of Marcus and Hush to recent developments. The emphasis is on the role of the electronic, and to a lesser extent the geometrical, properties of the electrode. A variety of experimental works are discussed in light of these theoretical concepts. Because the field of electron transfer is so vast, this review is far from comprehensive; rather, we focus on systems that offer a special interest and illuminate aspects of the theory.","12":"The chemistry of nitrogen-centered radicals (NCRs) has plentiful applications in organic synthesis, and they continue to expand as our understanding of these reactive species increases. The utility of these reactive intermediates is demonstrated in the recent advances in C-H amination and the (di)amination of alkenes. Synthesis of previously challenging structures can be achieved by efficient functionalization of sp2 moieties without prefunctionalization, allowing for faster and more streamlined synthesis. This Review addresses the generation, reactivity, and application of NCRs, including, but not limited to, iminyl, aminyl, amidyl, and aminium species. Contributions from early discovery up to the most recent examples have been highlighted, covering radical initiation, thermolysis, photolysis, and, more recently, photoredox catalysis. Radical-mediated intermolecular amination of (hetero)arenes can occur with a variety of complex amine precursors, generating aniline derivatives, an important class of structures for drug discovery and development. Functionalization of olefins is achievable in high anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity and allows access to difunctionalized structures when the intermediate carbon radicals are trapped. Additionally, the reactivity of NCRs can be harnessed for the rapid construction of N-heterocycles such as pyrrolidines, phenanthridines, quinoxalines, and quinazolinones.","13":"Diffusiophoresis is the spontaneous motion of particles under a concentration gradient of solutes. Since the first recognition by Derjaguin and colleagues in 1947 in the form of capillary osmosis, the phenomenon has been broadly investigated theoretically and experimentally. Early studies were mostly theoretical and were largely interested in surface coating applications, which considered the directional transport of coating particles. In the past decade, advances in microfluidics enabled controlled demonstrations of diffusiophoresis of micro- and nanoparticles. The electrokinetic nature and the typical scales of interest of the phenomenon motivated various experimental studies using simple microfluidic configurations. In this review, I will discuss studies that report diffusiophoresis in microfluidic systems, with the focus on the fundamental aspects of the reported results. In particular, parameters and influences of diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis in microfluidic systems and their combinations are highlighted.","14":"Proteins have dynamic structures that undergo chain motions on time scales spanning from picoseconds to seconds. Resolving the resultant conformational heterogeneity is essential for gaining accurate insight into fundamental mechanistic aspects of the protein folding reaction. The use of high-resolution structural probes, sensitive to population distributions, has begun to enable the resolution of site-specific conformational heterogeneity at different stages of the folding reaction. Different states populated during protein folding, including the unfolded state, collapsed intermediate states, and even the native state, are found to possess significant conformational heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in protein folding and unfolding reactions originates from the reduced cooperativity of various kinds of physicochemical interactions between various structural elements of a protein, and between a protein and solvent. Heterogeneity may arise because of functional or evolutionary constraints. Conformational substates within the unfolded state and the collapsed intermediates that exchange at rates slower than the subsequent folding steps give rise to heterogeneity on the protein folding pathways. Multiple folding pathways are likely to represent distinct sequences of structure formation. Insight into the nature of the energy barriers separating different conformational states populated during (un)folding can also be obtained by resolving heterogeneity.","15":"The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is an extra-cytoplasmic glycopeptide polymeric structure that protects bacteria from osmotic lysis and determines cellular shape. Since the cell wall surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane, bacteria must add new material to the PG matrix during cell elongation and division. The lipid-linked precursor for PG biogenesis, Lipid II, is synthesized in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane and is subsequently translocated across the bilayer so that the PG building block can be polymerized and cross-linked by complex multiprotein machines. This review focuses on major discoveries that have significantly changed our understanding of PG biogenesis in the past decade. In particular, we highlight progress made toward understanding the translocation of Lipid II across the cytoplasmic membrane by the MurJ flippase, as well as the recent discovery of a novel class of PG polymerases, the SEDS (shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) glycosyltransferases RodA and FtsW. Since PG biogenesis is an effective target of antibiotics, these recent developments may lead to the discovery of much-needed new classes of antibiotics to fight bacterial resistance.","16":"Bisimine derivatives of salicylaldehyde with chiral diamines (salens) are privileged ligands in asymmetric organometallic catalysis, which can be used in cooperation with organocatalysts as additives. The latter can be a modifier of the metal reactivity by liganding or a true co-catalyst working in tandem or in a dual system. All scenarios encountered in the literature are reviewed and classified according to the organocatalyst. In each case, mechanistic and physical-organic chemistry considerations are discussed to better understand the gears of these complex catalytic settings.","17":"The development and application of trimetallic nanoparticles continues to accelerate rapidly as a result of advances in materials design, synthetic control, and reaction characterization. Following the technological successes of multicomponent materials in automotive exhausts and photovoltaics, synergistic effects are now accessible through the careful preparation of multielement particles, presenting exciting opportunities in the field of catalysis. In this review, we explore the methods currently used in the design, synthesis, analysis, and application of trimetallic nanoparticles across both the experimental and computational realms and provide a critical perspective on the emergent field of trimetallic nanocatalysts. Trimetallic nanoparticles are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides for catalytic applications, synthesized via preparative conditions that are comparable to those applied for mono- and bimetallic nanoparticles. However, controlled elemental segregation and subsequent characterization remain challenging because of the heterogeneous nature of the systems. The multielement composition exhibits beneficial synergy for important oxidation, dehydrogenation, and hydrogenation reactions; in some cases, this is realized through higher selectivity, while activity improvements are also observed. However, challenges related to identifying and harnessing influential characteristics for maximum productivity remain. Computation provides support for the experimental endeavors, for example in electrocatalysis, and a clear need is identified for the marriage of simulation, with respect to both combinatorial element screening and optimal reaction design, to experiment in order to maximize productivity from this nascent field. Clear challenges remain with respect to identifying, making, and applying trimetallic catalysts efficiently, but the foundations are now visible, and the outlook is strong for this exciting chemical field.","18":"","19":"Negative thermal expansion (NTE), referring to the lattice contraction upon heating, has been an attractive topic of solid-state chemistry and functional materials. The response of a lattice to the temperature field is deeply rooted in its structural features and is inseparable from the physical properties. For the past 30 years, great efforts have been made to search for NTE compounds and control NTE performance. The demands of different applications give rise to the prominent development of new NTE systems covering multifarious chemical substances and many preparation routes. Even so, the intelligent design of NTE structures and efficient tailoring for lattice thermal expansion are still challenging. However, the diverse chemical routes to synthesize target compounds with featured structures provide a large number of strategies to achieve the desirable NTE behaviors with related properties. The chemical diversity is reflected in the wide regulating scale, flexible ways of introduction, and abundant structure-function insights. It inspires the rapid growth of new functional NTE compounds and understanding of the physical origins. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of the recent progress of chemical diversity in the tailoring of NTE. The efficient control of lattice and deep structural deciphering are carefully discussed. This comprehensive summary and perspective for chemical diversity are helpful to promote the creation of functional zero-thermal-expansion (ZTE) compounds and the practical utilization of NTE.","20":"The addition of a B-H bond to an unsaturated bond (polarized or unpolarized) is a powerful and atom-economic tool for the synthesis of organoboranes. In recent years, s-block organometallics have appeared as alternative catalysts to transition-metal complexes, which traditionally catalyze the hydroboration of unsaturated bonds. Because of the recent and rapid development in the field of hydroboration of unsaturated bonds catalyzed by alkali (Li, Na, K) and alkaline earth (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) metals, we provide a detailed and updated comprehensive review that covers the synthesis, reactivity, and application of s-block metal catalysts in the hydroboration of polarized as well as unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. Moreover, we describe the main reaction mechanisms, providing valuable insight into the reactivity of the s-block metal catalysts. Finally, we compare these s-block metal complexes with other redox-neutral catalytic systems based on p-block metals including aluminum complexes and f-block metal complexes of lanthanides and early actinides. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical assessment of the state of the art within this highly interesting research area.","21":null,"22":"A critical review of different prominent nanotechnologies adapted to catalysis is provided, with focus on how they contribute to the improvement of selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis. Ways to modify catalytic sites range from the use of the reversible or irreversible adsorption of molecular modifiers to the immobilization or tethering of homogeneous catalysts and the development of well-defined catalytic sites on solid surfaces. The latter covers methods for the dispersion of single-atom sites within solid supports as well as the use of complex nanostructures, and it includes the post-modification of materials via processes such as silylation and atomic layer deposition. All these methodologies exhibit both advantages and limitations, but all offer new avenues for the design of catalysts for specific applications. Because of the high cost of most nanotechnologies and the fact that the resulting materials may exhibit limited thermal or chemical stability, they may be best aimed at improving the selective synthesis of high value-added chemicals, to be incorporated in organic synthesis schemes, but other applications are being explored as well to address problems in energy production, for instance, and to design greener chemical processes. The details of each of these approaches are discussed, and representative examples are provided. We conclude with some general remarks on the future of this field.","23":"In the last two decades, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy has transformed from a spectroscopic technique investigating small molecules and industrial polymers to a potent tool decrypting structure and underlying dynamics of complex biological systems, such as membrane proteins, fibrils, and assemblies, in near-physiological environments and temperatures. This transformation can be ascribed to improvements in hardware design, sample preparation, pulsed methods, isotope labeling strategies, resolution, and sensitivity. The fundamental engagement between nuclear spins and radio-frequency pulses in the presence of a strong static magnetic field is identical between solution and ssNMR, but the experimental procedures vastly differ because of the absence of molecular tumbling in solids. This review discusses routinely employed state-of-the-art static and MAS pulsed NMR methods relevant for biological samples with rotational correlation times exceeding 100's of nanoseconds. Recent developments in signal filtering approaches, proton methodologies, and multiple acquisition techniques to boost sensitivity and speed up data acquisition at fast MAS are also discussed. Several examples of protein structures (globular, membrane, fibrils, and assemblies) solved with ssNMR spectroscopy have been considered. We also discuss integrated approaches to structurally characterize challenging biological systems and some newly emanating subdisciplines in ssNMR spectroscopy.","24":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging technology, a three-dimensional hybrid imaging modality that integrates the advantage of optical and acoustic imaging, has great application prospects in molecular imaging due to its high imaging depth and resolution. To endow PA imaging with the ability for real-time molecular visualization and precise biomedical diagnosis, numerous activatable molecular PA probes which can specifically alter their PA intensities upon reacting with the targets or biological events of interest have been developed. This review highlights the recent developments of activatable PA probes for precise biomedical applications including molecular detection of the biotargets and imaging of the biological events. First, the generation mechanism of PA signals will be given, followed by a brief introduction to contrast agents used for PA probe design. Then we will particularly summarize the general design principles for the alteration of PA signals and activatable strategies for developing precise PA probes. Furthermore, we will give a detailed discussion of activatable PA probes in molecular detection and biomedical imaging applications in living systems. At last, the current challenges and outlooks of future PA probes will be discussed. We hope that this review will stimulate new ideas to explore the potentials of activatable PA probes for precise biomedical applications in the future.","25":"Microorganisms have gained defense systems during the lengthy process of evolution over millions of years. Such defense systems can protect them from being attacked by invading species (e.g., CRISPR-Cas for establishing adaptive immune systems and nanopore-forming toxins as virulence factors) or enable them to adapt to different conditions (e.g., gas vesicles for achieving buoyancy control). These microorganism defense systems (MDS) have inspired the development of biosensors that have received much attention in a wide range of fields including life science research, food safety, and medical diagnosis. This Review comprehensively analyzes biosensing platforms originating from MDS for sensing and imaging biological analytes. We first describe a basic overview of MDS and MDS-inspired biosensing platforms (e.g., CRISPR-Cas systems, nanopore-forming proteins, and gas vesicles), followed by a critical discussion of their functions and properties. We then discuss several transduction mechanisms (optical, acoustic, magnetic, and electrical) involved in MDS-inspired biosensing. We further detail the applications of the MDS-inspired biosensors to detect a variety of analytes (nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, pathogens, cells, small molecules, and metal ions). In the end, we propose the key challenges and future perspectives in seeking new and improved MDS tools that can potentially lead to breakthrough discoveries in developing a new generation of biosensors with a combination of low cost; high sensitivity, accuracy, and precision; and fast detection. Overall, this Review gives a historical review of MDS, elucidates the principles of emulating MDS to develop biosensors, and analyzes the recent advancements, current challenges, and future trends in this field. It provides a unique critical analysis of emulating MDS to develop robust biosensors and discusses the design of such biosensors using elements found in MDS, showing that emulating MDS is a promising approach to conceptually advancing the design of biosensors.","26":"Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) plays an essential role in a wide range of electrocatalytic processes. A vast array of theoretical and computational methods have been developed to study electrochemical PCET. These methods can be used to calculate redox potentials and pKa values for molecular electrocatalysts, proton-coupled redox potentials and bond dissociation free energies for PCET at metal and semiconductor interfaces, and reorganization energies associated with electrochemical PCET. Periodic density functional theory can also be used to compute PCET activation energies and perform molecular dynamics simulations of electrochemical interfaces. Various approaches for maintaining a constant electrode potential in electronic structure calculations and modeling complex interactions in the electric double layer (EDL) have been developed. Theoretical formulations for both homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical PCET spanning the adiabatic, nonadiabatic, and solvent-controlled regimes have been developed and provide analytical expressions for the rate constants and current densities as functions of applied potential. The quantum mechanical treatment of the proton and inclusion of excited vibronic states have been shown to be critical for describing experimental data, such as Tafel slopes and potential-dependent kinetic isotope effects. The calculated rate constants can be used as input to microkinetic models and voltammogram simulations to elucidate complex electrocatalytic processes.","27":"Confusion is a novel concept of isomerism in porphyrin chemistry, delivering a steady stream of new chemistry since the discovery of N-confused porphyrin, a porphyrin mutant, in 1994. These days, the number of confused porphyrinoids is increasing, and confusion and associated fusion are found in various fields such as supramolecular chemistry, materials chemistry, biological chemistry, and catalysts. In this review, the birth and growth of confused porphyrinoids in the last three decades are described.","28":"Dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents comprise just over 40% of all organic solvents utilized in synthetic organic, medicinal, and process chemistry. Unfortunately, many of the common \"go-to\" solvents are considered to be \"less-preferable\" for a number of environmental, health, and safety (EHS) reasons such as toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or for practical handling reasons such as flammability and volatility. Recent legislative changes have initiated the implementation of restrictions on the use of many of the commonly employed dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and for ethers such as 1,4-dioxane. Thus, with growing legislative, EHS, and societal pressures, the need to identify and implement the use of alternative solvents that are greener, safer, and more sustainable has never been greater. Within this review, the ubiquitous nature of dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents is discussed with respect to the physicochemical properties that have made them so appealing to synthetic chemists. An overview of the current legislative restrictions being imposed on the use of dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents is discussed. A variety of alternative, safer, and more sustainable solvents that have garnered attention over the past decade are then examined, and case studies and examples where less-preferable solvents have been successfully replaced with a safer and more sustainable alternative are highlighted. Finally, a general overview and guidance for solvent selection and replacement are included in the Supporting Information of this review.","29":"Crude oils are complex mixtures of organic molecules, of which asphaltenes are the heaviest component. Asphaltene precipitation and deposition have been recognized to be a significant problem in oil production, transmission, and processing facilities. These macromolecular aromatics are challenging to characterize due to their heterogeneity and complex molecular structure. Microfluidic devices are able to capture key characteristics of reservoir rocks and provide new insights into the transport, reactions, and chemical interactions governing fluids used in the oil and gas industry. Understanding the microscale phenomena has led to better design of macroscale processes used by the industry. One area that has seen significant growth is in the area of chemical analysis under flowing conditions. Microfluidics and microscale analysis have advanced the understanding of complex mixtures by providing in situ imaging that can be combined with other chemical characterization methods to give details of how oil, water, and added chemicals interface with pore-scale detail. This review article aims to showcase how microfluidic devices offer new physical, chemical, and dynamic information on the behavior of asphaltenes. Specifically, asphaltene deposition and related flow assurance problems, interfacial properties and rheology, and evaluation of remediation strategies studied in microchannels and microfluidic porous media are presented. Examples of successful applications that address key asphaltene-related problems highlight the advances of microscale systems as a tool for advancing the physicochemical characterization of complex fluids for the oil and gas industry.","30":null,"31":"","32":"Motions in biomolecules are critical for biochemical reactions. In cells, many biochemical reactions are executed inside of biomolecular condensates formed by ultradynamic intrinsically disordered proteins. A deep understanding of the conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins in biomolecular condensates is therefore of utmost importance but is complicated by diverse obstacles. Here we review emerging data on the motions of intrinsically disordered proteins inside of liquidlike condensates. We discuss how liquid-liquid phase separation modulates internal motions across a wide range of time and length scales. We further highlight the importance of intermolecular interactions that not only drive liquid-liquid phase separation but appear as key determinants for changes in biomolecular motions and the aging of condensates in human diseases. The review provides a framework for future studies to reveal the conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins in the regulation of biomolecular condensate chemistry.","33":"Cell manipulation in droplets has emerged as one of the great successes of microfluidic technologies, with the development of single-cell screening. However, the droplet format has also served to go beyond single-cell studies, namely by considering the interactions between different cells or between cells and their physical or chemical environment. These studies pose specific challenges linked to the need for long-term culture of adherent cells or the diverse types of measurements associated with complex biological phenomena. Here we review the emergence of droplet microfluidic methods for culturing cells and studying their interactions. We begin by characterizing the quantitative aspects that determine the ability to encapsulate cells, transport molecules, and provide sufficient nutrients within the droplets. This is followed by an evaluation of the biological constraints such as the control of the biochemical environment and promoting the anchorage of adherent cells. This first part ends with a description of measurement methods that have been developed. The second part of the manuscript focuses on applications of these technologies for cancer studies, immunology, and stem cells while paying special attention to the biological relevance of the cellular assays and providing guidelines on improving this relevance.","34":"Organic compounds labeled with hydrogen isotopes play a crucial role in numerous areas, from materials science to medicinal chemistry. Indeed, while the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium gives rise to improved absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties in drugs and enables the preparation of internal standards for analytical mass spectrometry, the use of tritium-labeled compounds is a key technique all along drug discovery and development in the pharmaceutical industry. For these reasons, the interest in new methodologies for the isotopic enrichment of organic molecules and the extent of their applications are equally rising. In this regard, this Review intends to comprehensively discuss the new developments in this area over the last years (2017-2021). Notably, besides the fundamental hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions and the use of isotopically labeled analogues of common organic reagents, a plethora of reductive and dehalogenative deuteration techniques and other transformations with isotope incorporation are emerging and are now part of the labeling toolkit.","35":null,"36":"Hydrogen energy-based electrochemical energy conversion technologies offer the promise of enabling a transition of the global energy landscape from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of electrocatalysis in alkaline media and applications in alkaline-based energy technologies, particularly alkaline fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Anion exchange (alkaline) membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) enable the use of nonprecious electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), relative to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which require Pt-based electrocatalysts. However, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics is significantly slower in alkaline media than in acidic media. Understanding these phenomena requires applying theoretical and experimental methods to unravel molecular-level thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis and, particularly, the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that takes place in a proton-deficient alkaline media. Extensive electrochemical and spectroscopic studies, on single-crystal Pt and metal oxides, have contributed to the development of activity descriptors, as well as the identification of the nature of active sites, and the rate-determining steps of the HOR and ORR. Among these, the structure and reactivity of interfacial water serve as key potential and pH-dependent kinetic factors that are helping elucidate the origins of the HOR and ORR activity differences in acids and bases. Additionally, deliberately modulating and controlling catalyst-support interactions have provided valuable insights for enhancing catalyst accessibility and durability during operation. The design and synthesis of highly conductive and durable alkaline membranes\/ionomers have enabled AEMFCs to reach initial performance metrics equal to or higher than those of PEMFCs. We emphasize the importance of using membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) to integrate the often separately pursued\/optimized electrocatalyst\/support and membranes\/ionomer components. Operando\/in situ methods, at multiscales, and ab initio simulations provide a mechanistic understanding of electron, ion, and mass transport at catalyst\/ionomer\/membrane interfaces and the necessary guidance to achieve fuel cell operation in air over thousands of hours. We hope that this Review will serve as a roadmap for advancing the scientific understanding of the fundamental factors governing electrochemical energy conversion in alkaline media with the ultimate goal of achieving ultralow Pt or precious-metal-free high-performance and durable alkaline fuel cells and related technologies.","37":"Transforming how plastics are made, unmade, and remade through innovative research and diverse partnerships that together foster environmental stewardship is critically important to a sustainable future. Designing, preparing, and implementing polymers derived from renewable resources for a wide range of advanced applications that promote future economic development, energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability are all central to these efforts. In this Chemical Reviews contribution, we take a comprehensive, integrated approach to summarize important and impactful contributions to this broad research arena. The Review highlights signature accomplishments across a broad research portfolio and is organized into four wide-ranging research themes that address the topic in a comprehensive manner: Feedstocks, Polymerization Processes and Techniques, Intended Use, and End of Use. We emphasize those successes that benefitted from collaborative engagements across disciplinary lines.","38":"A grand family of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures have been discovered through the extensive experimental and theoretical efforts of chemists, material scientists, physicists, and technologists. These pioneering works contribute to realizing the fundamental platforms to explore and analyze new physical\/chemical properties and technological phenomena at the micro-nano-pico scales. Engineering 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures via chemical and physical methods with a suitable choice of stacking order, thickness, and interlayer interactions enable exotic carrier dynamics, showing potential in high-frequency electronics, broadband optoelectronics, low-power neuromorphic computing, and ubiquitous electronics. This comprehensive review addresses recent advances in terms of representative 2D materials, the general fabrication methods, and characterization techniques and the vital role of the physical parameters affecting the quality of 2D heterostructures. The main emphasis is on 2D heterostructures and 3D-bulk (3D) hybrid systems exhibiting intrinsic quantum mechanical responses in the optical, valley, and topological states. Finally, we discuss the universality of 2D heterostructures with representative applications and trends for future electronics and optoelectronics (FEO) under the challenges and opportunities from physical, nanotechnological, and material synthesis perspectives.","39":"Lanthanide supramolecular chemistry is a fast growing and intriguing research field due to the unique photophysical, magnetic, and coordination properties of lanthanide ions (LnIII). Compared with the intensively investigated mononuclear Ln-complexes, polymetallic lanthanide supramolecular assemblies offer more structural superiority and functional advantages. In recent decades, significant progress has been made in polynuclear lanthanide supramolecules, varying from structural evolution to luminescent and magnetic functional materials. This review summarizes the design principles in ligand-induced coordination-driven self-assembly of polynuclear Ln-structures and intends to offer guidance for the construction of more elegant Ln-based architectures and optimization of their functional performances. Design principles concerning the water solubility and chirality of the lanthanide-organic assemblies that are vital in extending their applications are emphasized. The strategies for improving the luminescent properties and the applications in up-conversion, host-guest chemistry, luminescent sensing, and catalysis have been summarized. Magnetic materials based on supramolecular assembled lanthanide architectures are given in an individual section and are classified based on their structural features. Challenges remaining and perspective directions in this field are also briefly discussed.","40":"While the application of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to helical polymers in biology has a long history, due to the huge number of helical macromolecular assemblies in viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, the use of cryo-EM to study synthetic soft matter noncovalent polymers has been much more limited. This has mainly been due to the lack of familiarity with cryo-EM in the materials science and chemistry communities, in contrast to the fact that cryo-EM was developed as a biological technique. Nevertheless, the relatively few structures of self-assembled peptide nanotubes and ribbons solved at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM have demonstrated that cryo-EM should be the method of choice for a structural analysis of synthetic helical filaments. In addition, cryo-EM has also demonstrated that the self-assembly of soft matter polymers has enormous potential for polymorphism, something that may be obscured by techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy. These cryo-EM structures have revealed how far we currently are from being able to predict the structure of these polymers due to their chaotic self-assembly behavior.","41":"The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique, through which monolayers are transferred from the air\/water interface onto a solid substrate, was the first method to allow for the controlled assembly of organic molecules. With its almost 100 year history, it has been the inspiration for most methods to functionalize surfaces and produce nanocoatings, in addition to serving to explore concepts in molecular electronics and nanoarchitectonics. This paper provides an overview of the history of Langmuir monolayers and LB films, including the potential use in devices and a discussion on why LB films are seldom considered for practical applications today. Emphasis is then given to two areas where these films offer unique opportunities, namely, in mimicking cell membrane models and exploiting nanoarchitectonics concepts to produce sensors, investigate molecular recognitions, and assemble molecular machines. The most promising topics for the short- and long-term prospects of the LB technique are also highlighted.","42":"The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cellular signaling pathway is a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. Activation of the intracellular STING protein triggers the production of a multifaceted array of immunostimulatory molecules, which, in the proper context, can drive dendritic cell maturation, antitumor macrophage polarization, T cell priming and activation, natural killer cell activation, vascular reprogramming, and\/or cancer cell death, resulting in immune-mediated tumor elimination and generation of antitumor immune memory. Accordingly, there is a significant amount of ongoing preclinical and clinical research toward further understanding the role of the STING pathway in cancer immune surveillance as well as the development of modulators of the pathway as a strategy to stimulate antitumor immunity. Yet, the efficacy of STING pathway agonists is limited by many drug delivery and pharmacological challenges. Depending on the class of STING agonist and the desired administration route, these may include poor drug stability, immunocellular toxicity, immune-related adverse events, limited tumor or lymph node targeting and\/or retention, low cellular uptake and intracellular delivery, and a complex dependence on the magnitude and kinetics of STING signaling. This review provides a concise summary of the STING pathway, highlighting recent biological developments, immunological consequences, and implications for drug delivery. This review also offers a critical analysis of an expanding arsenal of chemical strategies that are being employed to enhance the efficacy, safety, and\/or clinical utility of STING pathway agonists and lastly draws attention to several opportunities for therapeutic advancements.","43":"In conventional classification, soft robots feature mechanical compliance as the main distinguishing factor from traditional robots made of rigid materials. Recent advances in functional soft materials have facilitated the emergence of a new class of soft robots capable of tether-free actuation in response to external stimuli such as heat, light, solvent, or electric or magnetic field. Among the various types of stimuli-responsive materials, magnetic soft materials have shown remarkable progress in their design and fabrication, leading to the development of magnetic soft robots with unique advantages and potential for many important applications. However, the field of magnetic soft robots is still in its infancy and requires further advancements in terms of design principles, fabrication methods, control mechanisms, and sensing modalities. Successful future development of magnetic soft robots would require a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principle of magnetic actuation, as well as the physical properties and behavior of magnetic soft materials. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the design and fabrication, modeling and simulation, and actuation and control of magnetic soft materials and robots. We then give a set of design guidelines for optimal actuation performance of magnetic soft materials. Lastly, we summarize potential biomedical applications of magnetic soft robots and provide our perspectives on next-generation magnetic soft robots.","44":"Structures and processes at water\/metal interfaces play an important technological role in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, photoconversion, sensors, and corrosion, just to name a few. However, they are also of fundamental significance as a model system for the study of solid-liquid interfaces, which requires combining concepts from the chemistry and physics of crystalline materials and liquids. Particularly interesting is the fact that the water-water and water-metal interactions are of similar strength so that the structures at water\/metal interfaces result from a competition between these comparable interactions. Because water is a polar molecule and water and metal surfaces are both polarizable, explicit consideration of the electronic degrees of freedom at water\/metal interfaces is mandatory. In principle, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are thus the method of choice to model water\/metal interfaces, but they are computationally still rather demanding. Here, ab initio simulations of water\/metal interfaces will be reviewed, starting from static systems such as the adsorption of single water molecules, water clusters, and icelike layers, followed by the properties of liquid water layers at metal surfaces. Technical issues such as the appropriate first-principles description of the water-water and water-metal interactions will be discussed, and electrochemical aspects will be addressed. Finally, more approximate but numerically less demanding approaches to treat water at metal surfaces from first-principles will be briefly discussed.","45":"The number of rare earth (RE) starting materials used in synthesis is staggering, ranging from simple binary metal-halide salts to borohydrides and \"designer reagents\" such as alkyl and organoaluminate complexes. This review collates the most important starting materials used in RE synthetic chemistry, including essential information on their preparations and uses in modern synthetic methodologies. The review is divided by starting material category and supporting ligands (i.e., metals as synthetic precursors, halides, borohydrides, nitrogen donors, oxygen donors, triflates, and organometallic reagents), and in each section relevant synthetic methodologies and applications are discussed.","46":"Solid-state NMR with magic-angle spinning (MAS) is an important method in structural biology. While NMR can provide invaluable information about local geometry on an atomic scale even for large biomolecular assemblies lacking long-range order, it is often limited by low sensitivity due to small nuclear spin polarization in thermal equilibrium. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has evolved during the last decades to become a powerful method capable of increasing this sensitivity by two to three orders of magnitude, thereby reducing the valuable experimental time from weeks or months to just hours or days; in many cases, this allows experiments that would be otherwise completely unfeasible. In this review, we give an overview of the developments that have opened the field for DNP-enhanced biomolecular solid-state NMR including state-of-the-art applications at fast MAS and high magnetic field. We present DNP mechanisms, polarizing agents, and sample constitution methods suitable for biomolecules. A wide field of biomolecular NMR applications is covered including membrane proteins, amyloid fibrils, large biomolecular assemblies, and biomaterials. Finally, we present perspectives and recent developments that may shape the field of biomolecular DNP in the future.","47":null,"48":"Paramagnetic chemical probes have been used in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for more than four decades. Recent years witnessed a great increase in the variety of probes for the study of biological macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, and oligosaccharides). This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing paramagnetic chemical probes, including chemical synthetic approaches, functional properties, and selected applications. Recent developments have seen, in particular, a rapid expansion of the range of lanthanoid probes with anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities for the generation of structural restraints based on residual dipolar couplings and pseudocontact shifts in solution and solid state NMR spectroscopy, mostly for protein studies. Also many new isotropic paramagnetic probes, suitable for NMR measurements of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements, as well as EPR spectroscopic studies (in particular double resonance techniques) have been developed and employed to investigate biological macromolecules. Notwithstanding the large number of reported probes, only few have found broad application and further development of probes for dedicated applications is foreseen.","49":"Remarkable progress made in the past few decades in brain research enables the manipulation of neuronal activity in single neurons and neural circuits and thus allows the decipherment of relations between nervous systems and behavior. The discovery of glymphatic and lymphatic systems in the brain and the recently unveiled tight relations between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS) further revolutionize our understanding of brain structures and functions. Fundamental questions about how neurons conduct two-way communications with the gut to establish the gut-brain axis (GBA) and interact with essential brain components such as glial cells and blood vessels to regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in health and disease, however, remain. Microfluidics with unparalleled advantages in the control of fluids at microscale has emerged recently as an effective approach to address these critical questions in brain research. The dynamics of cerebral fluids (i.e., blood and CSF) and novel in vitro brain-on-a-chip models and microfluidic-integrated multifunctional neuroelectronic devices, for example, have been investigated. This review starts with a critical discussion of the current understanding of several key topics in brain research such as neurovascular coupling (NVC), glymphatic pathway, and GBA and then interrogates a wide range of microfluidic-based approaches that have been developed or can be improved to advance our fundamental understanding of brain functions. Last, emerging technologies for structuring microfluidic devices and their implications and future directions in brain research are discussed.","50":"","51":null,"52":"Transition-metal-exchanged zeolites perform remarkable chemical reactions from low-temperature methane to methanol oxidation to selective reduction of NOx pollutants. As with metalloenzymes, metallozeolites have impressive reactivities that are controlled in part by interactions outside the immediate coordination sphere. These second-sphere effects include activating a metal site through enforcing an \"entatic\" state, controlling binding and access to the metal site with pockets and channels, and directing radical rebound vs cage escape. This review explores these effects with emphasis placed on but not limited to the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with a focus on copper and iron active sites, although other transition-metal-ion zeolite reactions are also explored. While the actual active-site geometric and electronic structures are different in the copper and iron metallozeolites compared to the metalloenzymes, their second-sphere interactions with the lattice or the protein environments are found to have strong parallels that contribute to their high activity and selectivity.","53":"Benefiting from the impressive increase in fundamental knowledge, the last 20 years have shown a continuous burst of new ideas and consequently a plethora of new catalytic methods for enantioselective radical reactions. This review aims to provide a complete survey of progress achieved over this latter period. The first part of this review focuses on the use of chiral organocatalysts, and these include catalysts covalently linked to the substrate and those that interact with the substrate by weaker interactions like hydrogen bonds. The second part of the review is devoted to transition-metal redox catalysis which is organized according to increasing atomic number for the first-row transition metals (Ti, Cr, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu). Bioinspired manganese- and iron-mediated hydroxylations and oxidations are also discussed. A specific section is dedicated to the reactivity of Ru, Rh, and Ir complexes as Lewis acids with a special focus on complexes chiral at metal. Absorption of photons result in different events such as energy transfer, single-electron transfer, and hydrogen-atom transfer facilitating the formation of radicals. Organocatalysis has been successfully combined with photocatalysts, a reactivity which has opened new pathways enlarging the number of radical precursors available. The merger of photocatalysis with organo- or metalla-photocatalysis has brought novelty and allowed for the discovery of a large number of original transformations. The use of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving radical intermediates which also largely benefit from visible-light irradiation are included in the review. This review provides a comprehensive inventory of progress in enantioselective radical reactions with a goal of detailing the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations such that any nonspecialist could find their own creativity to invent yet unknown applications.","54":"A detailed knowledge of the complex processes that make cells and organisms alive is fundamental in order to understand diseases and to develop novel drugs and therapeutic treatments. To this aim, biological macromolecules should ideally be characterized at atomic resolution directly within the cellular environment. Among the existing structural techniques, solution NMR stands out as the only one able to investigate at high resolution the structure and dynamic behavior of macromolecules directly in living cells. With the advent of more sensitive NMR hardware and new biotechnological tools, modern in-cell NMR approaches have been established since the early 2000s. At the coming of age of in-cell NMR, we provide a detailed overview of its developments and applications in the 20 years that followed its inception. We review the existing approaches for cell sample preparation and isotopic labeling, the application of in-cell NMR to important biological questions, and the development of NMR bioreactor devices, which greatly increase the lifetime of the cells allowing real-time monitoring of intracellular metabolites and proteins. Finally, we share our thoughts on the future perspectives of the in-cell NMR methodology.","55":null,"56":"Microscale surgery on single cells and small organisms has enabled major advances in fundamental biology and in engineering biological systems. Examples of applications range from wound healing and regeneration studies to the generation of hybridoma to produce monoclonal antibodies. Even today, these surgical operations are often performed manually, but they are labor intensive and lack reproducibility. Microfluidics has emerged as a powerful technology to control and manipulate cells and multicellular systems at the micro- and nanoscale with high precision. Here, we review the physical and chemical mechanisms of microscale surgery and the corresponding design principles, applications, and implementations in microfluidic systems. We consider four types of surgical operations: (1) sectioning, which splits a biological entity into multiple parts, (2) ablation, which destroys part of an entity, (3) biopsy, which extracts materials from within a living cell, and (4) fusion, which joins multiple entities into one. For each type of surgery, we summarize the motivating applications and the microfluidic devices developed. Throughout this review, we highlight existing challenges and opportunities. We hope that this review will inspire scientists and engineers to continue to explore and improve microfluidic surgical methods.","57":"The crystal-liquid-glass phase transition of coordination polymers (CPs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers attractive opportunities as a new class of amorphous materials. Unlike conventional glasses, coordination chemistry allows the utilization of rational design concepts to fine-tune the desired properties. Although the glassy state has been rare in CPs\/MOFs, it exhibits diverse advantages complementary to their crystalline counterparts, including improved mass transport, optical properties, mechanical properties, and the ability to form grain-boundary-free monoliths. This Review discusses the current achievements in improving the understanding of anomalous phase transitions in CPs\/MOFs. We elaborate on the criteria for classifying CP\/MOF glasses and comprehensively discuss the three common strategies employed to obtain a glassy state. We include all CP\/MOF glass research progress since its inception, discuss the current challenges, and express our perspective on future research directions.","58":"Over the past few decades, coherent broadband spectroscopy has been widely used to improve our understanding of ultrafast processes (e.g., photoinduced electron transfer, proton transfer, and proton-coupled electron transfer reactions) at femtosecond resolution. The advances in femtosecond laser technology along with the development of nonlinear multidimensional spectroscopy enabled further insights into ultrafast energy transfer and carrier relaxation processes in complex biological and material systems. New discoveries and interpretations have led to improved design principles for optimizing the photophysical properties of various artificial systems. In this review, we first provide a detailed theoretical framework of both coherent broadband and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). We then discuss a selection of experimental approaches and considerations of 2DES along with best practices for data processing and analysis. Finally, we review several examples where coherent broadband and 2DES were employed to reveal mechanisms of photoinitiated ultrafast processes in molecular, biological, and material systems. We end the review with a brief perspective on the future of the experimental techniques themselves and their potential to answer an even greater range of scientific questions.","59":"Operando characterization plays an important role in revealing the structure-property relationships of organic mixed ionic\/electronic conductors (OMIECs), enabling the direct observation of dynamic changes during device operation and thus guiding the development of new materials. This review focuses on the application of different operando characterization techniques in the study of OMIECs, highlighting the time-dependent and bias-dependent structure, composition, and morphology information extracted from these techniques. We first illustrate the needs, requirements, and challenges of operando characterization then provide an overview of relevant experimental techniques, including spectroscopy, scattering, microbalance, microprobe, and electron microscopy. We also compare different in silico methods and discuss the interplay of these computational methods with experimental techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future development of operando for OMIEC-based devices and look toward multimodal operando techniques for more comprehensive and accurate description of OMIECs.","60":"Layered lithium transition metal oxides derived from LiMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) have been widely adopted as the cathodes of Li-ion batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles, and energy storage. Oxygen loss in the layered oxides is one of the major factors leading to cycling-induced structural degradation and its associated fade in electrochemical performance.

Searching for fast ion conductors with sufficient electrochemical and chemical stabilities is at the heart of solid-state battery research and applications. Recently, significant progress has been made in solid-state electrolyte development. Sulfide-, oxide-, and halide-based electrolytes have been able to achieve high ionic conductivities of more than 10-3 S\/cm at room temperature, which are comparable to liquid-based electrolytes. However, their stability toward Li metal anodes poses significant challenges for these electrolytes.

Originating in molecular chemistry with finite solutes, implicit solvation techniques are now increasingly used in the context of first-principles modeling of electrochemistry and electrocatalysis at extended (often metallic) electrodes. The prevalent ansatz to model the latter electrodes and the reactive surface chemistry at them through slabs in periodic boundary condition supercells brings its specific challenges.

Metal coordination chemistry, especially with iron, is at the heart of many biological transformations involving NO. A series of heme proteins, nitric oxide synthases (NOS), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), and nitrophorins, are responsible for the biosynthesis, sensing, and transport of NO. Alternatively, NO can be generated from nitrite by heme- and copper-containing nitrite reductases (NIRs).

This Review provides comprehensive insight into the use of these processes at the microfluidic scales for applications ranging from passive pumping to the screening of phase diagrams and micromaterials engineering. Indeed, for a fixed interface relative to the microfluidic chip, these processes passively induce flows driven only by gradients of chemical potential. As a consequence, these passive-transport phenomena lead to an accumulation of solutes that cannot cross the interface and thus concentrate solutions in the microfluidic chip up to high concentration regimes, possibly up to solidification. The purpose of this Review is to provide a unified description of these processes and associated microfluidic applications to highlight the differences and similarities between these three passive-transport phenomena.","97":"Extracellular matrixes (ECMs), such as the cell walls and biofilms, are important for supporting cell integrity and function and regulating intercellular communication.

In perdeuterated proteins, proton dipolar interactions are strongly attenuated, which allows yielding of high-resolution proton spectra. Perdeuteration and backsubstitution of exchangeable protons is essential if samples are rotated with MAS rotation frequencies below 60 kHz. Protonated samples can be investigated directly without spin dilution using proton detection methods in case the MAS frequency exceeds 110 kHz. This review summarizes labeling strategies and the spectroscopic methods to perform experiments that yield assignments, quantitative information on structure, and dynamics using perdeuterated samples.

Flavylium compounds include a large variety of natural compound classes, namely, anthocyanins, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, auronidins, and their respective aglycones as well as anthocyanin-derived pigments (e.g., pyranoanthocyanins, anthocyanin-flavan-3-ol dimers). During the past few decades, there has been increasing interest among chemists in synthesizing different flavylium compounds that mimic natural structures but with different substitution patterns that present a variety of spectroscopic characteristics in view of their applications in different industrial fields.

Expanding on many of the advantages of traditional ATRP, O-ATRP allows well-defined polymers to be produced under mild reaction conditions using organic photoredox catalysts. As a result, O-ATRP has opened access to a range of sensitive applications where the use of a metal catalyst could be of concern, such as electronics, certain biological applications, and the polymerization of coordinating monomers. However, key limitations of this method remain and necessitate further investigation to continue the development of this field.

Their unique optical, electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties make 2DMs key building blocks for the fabrication of novel complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and beyond-CMOS devices. Major advances in device functionality and performance have been made by the covalent or noncovalent functionalization of 2DMs with molecules: while the molecular coating of metal electrodes and dielectrics allows for more efficient charge injection and transport through the 2DMs, the combination of dynamic molecular systems, capable to respond to external stimuli, with 2DMs makes it possible to generate hybrid systems possessing new properties by realizing stimuli-responsive functional devices and thereby enabling functional diversification in More-than-Moore technologies.

Finally, we present the challenges, opportunities, and long-term perspectives in this technologically promising field.","111":"","112":null,"113":"Carbide complexes remain a rare class of molecules. Their paucity does not reflect exceptional instability but is rather due to the generally narrow scope of synthetic procedures for constructing carbide complexes. The preparation of carbide complexes typically revolves around generating LnM-CEx fragments, followed by cleavage of the C-E bonds of the coordinated carbon-based ligands (the alternative being direct C atom transfer). Prime examples involve deoxygenation of carbonyl ligands and deprotonation of methyl ligands, but several other p-block fragments can be cleaved off to afford carbide ligands. This Review outlines synthetic strategies toward terminal carbide complexes, bridging carbide complexes, as well as carbide-carbonyl cluster complexes. It then surveys the reactivity of carbide complexes, covering stoichiometric reactions where the carbide ligands act as C1 reagents, engage in cross-coupling reactions, and enact Fischer-Tropsch-like chemistry; in addition, we discuss carbide complexes in the context of catalysis.

This Review focuses on an emerging class of optical manipulation techniques, termed heat-mediated optical manipulation. In comparison to conventional optical tweezers that rely on a tightly focused laser beam to trap objects, heat-mediated optical manipulation techniques exploit tailorable optothermo-matter interactions and rich mass transport dynamics to enable versatile control of matter of various compositions, shapes, and sizes. In addition to conventional tweezing, more distinct manipulation modes, including optothermal pulling, nudging, rotating, swimming, oscillating, and walking, have been demonstrated to enhance the functionalities using simple and low-power optics. We start with an introduction to basic physics involved in heat-mediated optical manipulation, highlighting major working mechanisms underpinning a variety of manipulation techniques.

Metallaphotoredox catalysis has combined the unparalleled capacity of transition metal catalysis for bond formation with the broad utility of photoinduced electron- and energy-transfer processes. Photocatalytic substrate activation has allowed the engagement of simple starting materials in metal-mediated bond-forming processes.

Beyond single-atom protrusions, two more motifs of single-atom substitutions and single-atom vacancies along with synergistic single-atom motif assemblies have been progressively developed to enrich the single-atom family. On the other hand, besides traditional carbon material based substrates, a wide variety of 2D transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been emerging as a promising platform for single-atom catalysis owing to their diverse elemental compositions, variable crystal structures, flexible electronic structures, and intrinsic activities toward many catalytic reactions. Such substantial expansion of both single-atom motifs and substrates provides an enriched toolbox to further optimize the geometric and electronic structures for pushing the performance limit. Concomitantly, higher requirements have been put forward for synthetic and characterization techniques with related technical bottlenecks being continuously conquered. Furthermore, this burgeoning single-atom catalyst (SAC) system has triggered serial scientific issues about their changeable single atom-2D substrate interaction, ambiguous synergistic effects of various atomic assemblies, as well as dynamic structure-performance correlations, all of which necessitate further clarification and comprehensive summary. In this context, this Review aims to summarize and critically discuss the single-atom engineering development in the whole field of 2D TMD based catalysis covering their evolution history, synthetic methodologies, characterization techniques, catalytic applications, and dynamic structure-performance correlations. In situ characterization techniques are highlighted regarding their critical roles in real-time detection of SAC reconstruction and reaction pathway evolution, thus shedding light on lifetime dynamic structure-performance correlations which lay a solid theoretical foundation for the whole catalytic field, especially for SACs.","120":"This is a review of atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis as applied to the study of molecular materials. The PDF method is a powerful approach to study short- and intermediate-range order in materials on the nanoscale. It may be obtained from total scattering measurements using X-rays, neutrons, or electrons, and it provides structural details when defects, disorder, or structural ambiguities obscure their elucidation directly in reciprocal space. While its uses in the study of inorganic crystals, glasses, and nanomaterials have been recently highlighted, significant progress has also been made in its application to molecular materials such as carbons, pharmaceuticals, polymers, liquids, coordination compounds, composites, and more. Here, an overview of applications toward a wide variety of molecular compounds (organic and inorganic) and systems with molecular components is presented. We then present pedagogical descriptions and tips for further implementation. Successful utilization of the method requires an interdisciplinary consolidation of material preparation, high quality scattering experimentation, data processing, model formulation, and attentive scrutiny of the results. It is hoped that this article will provide a useful reference to practitioners for PDF applications in a wide realm of molecular sciences, and help new practitioners to get started with this technique.","121":"The past decades have witnessed a rapid expansion in investigations of two-dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes), which are promising materials in various fields, including applications in optoelectronic devices, biomedicine, catalysis, and energy storage.

Finally, this review concludes with an assessment of the current status, a description of existing scientific and application challenges, and a discussion of possible directions to advance this fertile field.","122":"Smart materials can respond to stimuli and adapt their responses based on external cues from their environments. Such behavior requires a way to transport energy efficiently and then convert it for use in applications such as actuation, sensing, or signaling. Ultrasound can carry energy safely and with low losses through complex and opaque media. It can be localized to small regions of space and couple to systems over a wide range of time scales. However, the same characteristics that allow ultrasound to propagate efficiently through materials make it difficult to convert acoustic energy into other useful forms. Recent work across diverse fields has begun to address this challenge, demonstrating ultrasonic effects that provide control over physical and chemical systems with surprisingly high specificity. Here, we review recent progress in ultrasound-matter interactions, focusing on effects that can be incorporated as components in smart materials. These techniques build on fundamental phenomena such as cavitation, microstreaming, scattering, and acoustic radiation forces to enable capabilities such as actuation, sensing, payload delivery, and the initiation of chemical or biological processes. The diversity of emerging techniques holds great promise for a wide range of smart capabilities supported by ultrasound and poses interesting questions for further investigations.","123":null,"124":"","125":"Hierarchic self-assembly underpins much of the form and function seen in synthetic or biological soft materials. Lipids are paramount examples, building themselves in nature or synthetically in a variety of meso\/nanostructures. Synthetic block copolymers capture many of lipid's structural and functional properties. Lipids are typically biocompatible and high molecular weight polymers are mechanically robust and chemically versatile. The development of new materials for applications like controlled drug\/gene\/protein delivery, biosensors, and artificial cells often requires the combination of lipids and polymers. The emergent composite material, a \"polymer-lipid hybrid membrane\", displays synergistic properties not seen in pure components.

Both approaches provide access to high energy intermediates (e.g., radicals) that enable bond formations not constrained by the rules of ionic or 2 electron (e) mechanisms. Instead, they enable 1e mechanisms capable of bypassing electronic or steric limitations and protecting group requirements, thus enabling synthetic chemists to disconnect molecules in new and different ways. However, while providing access to similar intermediates, electrochemistry and photoredox catalysis differ in several physical chemistry principles. Understanding those differences can be key to designing new transformations and forging new bond disconnections. This review aims to highlight these differences and similarities between electrochemistry and photoredox catalysis by comparing their underlying physical chemistry principles and describing their impact on electrochemical and photochemical methods.","127":"Colloidal self-assembly refers to a solution-processed assembly of nanometer-\/micrometer-sized, well-dispersed particles into secondary structures, whose collective properties are controlled by not only nanoparticle property but also the superstructure symmetry, orientation, phase, and dimension.

The plethora of online and offline preparation, separation, and purification methods as well as numerous ionization techniques combined with powerful new hybrid ion mobility and mass spectrometry systems has illustrated the great potential of nMS for structural biology. Fundamental to the progression of nMS has been the development of novel activation methods for dissociating proteins and protein complexes to deduce primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure through the combined use of multiple MS\/MS technologies. This review highlights the key features and advantages of surface collisions (surface-induced dissociation, SID) for probing the connectivity of subunits within protein and nucleoprotein complexes and, in particular, for solving protein structure in conjunction with complementary techniques such as cryo-EM and computational modeling. Several case studies highlight the significant role SID, and more generally nMS, will play in structural elucidation of biological assemblies in the future as the technology becomes more widely adopted.

These high-performance chemical reactions have been developed to meet requirements not often provided by the chemical reactions commonly used today in the biological environment, such as selectivity, rapid reaction rate, and biocompatibility. Click and bioorthogonal reactions have been attracting increasing attention in the biomedical field for the engineering of nanomedicines. In this review, we study a compilation of articles from 2014 to the present, using the terms \"click chemistry and nanoparticles (NPs)\" to highlight the application of this type of chemistry for applications involving NPs intended for biomedical applications. This study identifies the main strategies offered by click and bioorthogonal chemistry, with respect to passive and active targeting, for NP functionalization with specific and multiple properties for imaging and cancer therapy. In the final part, a novel and promising approach for \"two step\" targeting of NPs, called pretargeting (PT), is also discussed; the principle of this strategy as well as all the studies listed from 2014 to the present are presented in more detail.","140":"","141":"","142":"Heat is an abundant but often wasted source of energy. Thus, harvesting just a portion of this tremendous amount of energy holds significant promise for a more sustainable society. While traditional solid-state inorganic semiconductors have dominated the research stage on thermal-to-electrical energy conversion, carbon-based semiconductors have recently attracted a great deal of attention as potential thermoelectric materials for low-temperature energy harvesting, primarily driven by the high abundance of their atomic elements, ease of processing\/manufacturing, and intrinsically low thermal conductivity. This quest for new materials has resulted in the discovery of several new kinds of thermoelectric materials and concepts capable of converting a heat flux into an electrical current by means of various types of particles transporting the electric charge: (i) electrons, (ii) ions, and (iii) redox molecules. This has contributed to expanding the applications envisaged for thermoelectric materials far beyond simple conversion of heat into electricity. This is the motivation behind this review. This work is divided in three sections. In the first section, we present the basic principle of the thermoelectric effects when the particles transporting the electric charge are electrons, ions, and redox molecules and describe the conceptual differences between the three thermodiffusion phenomena. In the second section, we review the efforts made on developing devices exploiting these three effects and give a thorough understanding of what limits their performance. In the third section, we review the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials investigated so far and provide a comprehensive understanding of what limits charge and energy transport in each of these classes of materials.","143":"Internuclear distances represent one of the main structural constraints in molecular structure determination using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, complementing chemical shifts and orientational restraints. Although a large number of magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR techniques have been available for distance measurements, traditional 13C and 15N NMR experiments are inherently limited to distances of a few angstroms due to the low gyromagnetic ratios of these nuclei. Recent development of fast MAS triple-resonance 19F and 1H NMR probes has stimulated the design of MAS NMR experiments that measure distances in the 1-2 nm range with high sensitivity. This review describes the principles and applications of these multiplexed multidimensional correlation distance NMR experiments, with an emphasis on 19F- and 1H-based distance experiments. Representative applications of these long-distance NMR methods to biological macromolecules as well as small molecules are reviewed.","144":"The development of advanced structural alloys with performance meeting the requirements of extreme environments in nuclear reactors has been long pursued. In the long history of alloy development, the search for metallic alloys with improved radiation tolerance or increased structural strength has relied on either incorporating alloying elements at low concentrations to synthesize so-called dilute alloys or incorporating nanoscale features to mitigate defects. In contrast to traditional approaches, recent success in synthesizing multicomponent concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs), including medium-entropy and high-entropy alloys, has vastly expanded the compositional space for new alloy discovery. Their wide variety of elemental diversity enables tunable chemical disorder and sets CSAs apart from traditional dilute alloys. The tunable electronic structure critically lowers the effectiveness of energy dissipation via the electronic subsystem. The tunable chemical complexity also modifies the scattering mechanisms in the atomic subsystem that control energy transport through phonons. The level of chemical disorder depends substantively on the specific alloying elements, rather than the number of alloying elements, as the disorder does not monotonically increase with a higher number of alloying elements. To go beyond our knowledge based on conventional alloys and take advantage of property enhancement by tuning chemical disorder, this review highlights synergistic effects involving valence electrons and atomic-level and nanoscale inhomogeneity in CSAs composed of multiple transition metals. Understanding of the energy dissipation pathways, deformation tolerance, and structural stability of CSAs can proceed by exploiting the equilibrium and non-equilibrium defect processes at the electronic and atomic levels, with or without microstructural inhomogeneities at multiple length scales. Knowledge of tunable chemical disorder in CSAs may advance the understanding of the substantial modifications in element-specific alloy properties that effectively mitigate radiation damage and control a material's response in extreme environments, as well as overcome strength-ductility trade-offs and provide overarching design strategies for structural alloys.","145":"A substantial amount of research effort has been directed toward the development of Pt-based catalysts with higher performance and durability than conventional polycrystalline Pt nanoparticles to achieve high-power and innovative energy conversion systems. Currently, attention has been paid toward expanding the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of catalysts and increase their intrinsic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, despite innumerable efforts having been carried out to explore this possibility, most of these achievements have focused on the rotating disk electrode (RDE) in half-cells, and relatively few results have been adaptable to membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) in full-cells, which is the actual operating condition of fuel cells. Thus, it is uncertain whether these advanced catalysts can be used as a substitute in practical fuel cell applications, and an improvement in the catalytic performance in real-life fuel cells is still necessary. Therefore, from a more practical and industrial point of view, the goal of this review is to compare the ORR catalyst performance and durability in half- and full-cells, providing a differentiated approach to the durability concerns in half- and full-cells, and share new perspectives for strategic designs used to induce additional performance in full-cell devices.","146":"Soft and hard materials at interfaces exhibit mismatched behaviors, such as mismatched chemical or biochemical reactivity, mechanical response, and environmental adaptability. Leveraging or mitigating these differences can yield interfacial processes difficult to achieve, or inapplicable, in pure soft or pure hard phases. Exploration of interfacial mismatches and their associated (bio)chemical, mechanical, or other physical processes may yield numerous opportunities in both fundamental studies and applications, in a manner similar to that of semiconductor heterojunctions and their contribution to solid-state physics and the semiconductor industry over the past few decades. In this review, we explore the fundamental chemical roles and principles involved in designing these interfaces, such as the (bio)chemical evolution of adaptive or buffer zones. We discuss the spectroscopic, microscopic, (bio)chemical, and computational tools required to uncover the chemical processes in these confined or hidden soft-hard interfaces. We propose a soft-hard interaction framework and use it to discuss soft-hard interfacial processes in multiple systems and across several spatiotemporal scales, focusing on tissue-like materials and devices. We end this review by proposing several new scientific and engineering approaches to leveraging the soft-hard interfacial processes involved in biointerfacing composites and exploring new applications for these composites.","147":null,"148":null,"149":"This review adds the bilin-binding phytochromes to the Chemical Reviews thematic issue \"Optogenetics and Photopharmacology\". The work is structured into two parts. We first outline the photochemistry of the covalently bound tetrapyrrole chromophore and summarize relevant spectroscopic, kinetic, biochemical, and physiological properties of the different families of phytochromes. Based on this knowledge, we then describe the engineering of phytochromes to further improve these chromoproteins as photoswitches and review their employment in an ever-growing number of different optogenetic applications. Most applications rely on the light-controlled complex formation between the plant photoreceptor PhyB and phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) or C-terminal light-regulated domains with enzymatic functions present in many bacterial and algal phytochromes. Phytochrome-based optogenetic tools are currently implemented in bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals to achieve light control of a wide range of biological activities. These cover the regulation of gene expression, protein transport into cell organelles, and the recruitment of phytochrome- or PIF-tagged proteins to membranes and other cellular compartments. This compilation illustrates the intrinsic advantages of phytochromes compared to other photoreceptor classes, e.g., their bidirectional dual-wavelength control enabling instant ON and OFF regulation. In particular, the long wavelength range of absorption and fluorescence within the \"transparent window\" makes phytochromes attractive for complex applications requiring deep tissue penetration or dual-wavelength control in combination with blue and UV light-sensing photoreceptors. In addition to the wide variability of applications employing natural and engineered phytochromes, we also discuss recent progress in the development of bilin-based fluorescent proteins.","150":"Membrane proteins (MPs) play essential roles in numerous cellular processes. Because around 70% of the currently marketed drugs target MPs, a detailed understanding of their structure, binding properties, and functional dynamics in a physiologically relevant environment is crucial for a more detailed understanding of this important protein class. We here summarize the benefits of using lipid nanodiscs for NMR structural investigations and provide a detailed overview of the currently used lipid nanodisc systems as well as their applications in solution-state NMR. Despite the increasing use of other structural methods for the structure determination of MPs in lipid nanodiscs, solution NMR turns out to be a versatile tool to probe a wide range of MP features, ranging from the structure determination of small to medium-sized MPs to probing ligand and partner protein binding as well as functionally relevant dynamical signatures in a lipid nanodisc setting. We will expand on these topics by discussing recent NMR studies with lipid nanodiscs and work out a key workflow for optimizing the nanodisc incorporation of an MP for subsequent NMR investigations. With this, we hope to provide a comprehensive background to enable an informed assessment of the applicability of lipid nanodiscs for NMR studies of a particular MP of interest.","151":"In vivo imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), which enables us to look deeply into living subjects, is producing marvelous opportunities for biomedical research and clinical applications. Very recently, there has been an upsurge of interdisciplinary studies focusing on developing versatile types of inorganic\/organic fluorophores that can be used for noninvasive NIR-IIa\/IIb imaging (NIR-IIa, 1300-1400 nm; NIR-IIb, 1500-1700 nm) with near-zero tissue autofluorescence and deeper tissue penetration. This review provides an overview of the reports published to date on the design, properties, molecular imaging, and theranostics of inorganic\/organic NIR-IIa\/IIb fluorophores. First, we summarize the design concepts of the up-to-date functional NIR-IIa\/IIb biomaterials, in the order of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth-doped nanoparticles (RENPs), and organic fluorophores (OFs). Then, these novel imaging modalities and versatile biomedical applications brought by these superior fluorescent properties are reviewed. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future clinical translation, aiming at boosting the clinical application progress of NIR-IIa and NIR-IIb imaging technology are highlighted.","152":"Transition-metal-catalyzed C-H activation has developed a contemporary approach to the omnipresent area of retrosynthetic disconnection. Scientific researchers have been tempted to take the help of this methodology to plan their synthetic discourses. This paradigm shift has helped in the development of industrial units as well, making the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical drugs step-economical. In the vast zone of C-H bond activation, the functionalization of proximal C-H bonds has gained utmost popularity. Unlike the activation of proximal C-H bonds, the distal C-H functionalization is more strenuous and requires distinctly specialized techniques. In this review, we have compiled various methods adopted to functionalize distal C-H bonds, mechanistic insights within each of these procedures, and the scope of the methodology. With this review, we give a complete overview of the expeditious progress the distal C-H activation has made in the field of synthetic organic chemistry while also highlighting its pitfalls, thus leaving the field open for further synthetic modifications.","153":"The functions, purposes, and roles of metallothioneins have been the subject of speculations since the discovery of the protein over 60 years ago. This article guides through the history of investigations and resolves multiple contentions by providing new interpretations of the structure-stability-function relationship. It challenges the dogma that the biologically relevant structure of the mammalian proteins is only the one determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. The terms metallothionein and thionein are ambiguous and insufficient to understand biological function. The proteins need to be seen in their biological context, which limits and defines the chemistry possible. They exist in multiple forms with different degrees of metalation and types of metal ions. The homoleptic thiolate coordination of mammalian metallothioneins is important for their molecular mechanism. It endows the proteins with redox activity and a specific pH dependence of their metal affinities. The proteins, therefore, also exist in different redox states of the sulfur donor ligands. Their coordination dynamics allows a vast conformational landscape for interactions with other proteins and ligands. Many fundamental signal transduction pathways regulate the expression of the dozen of human metallothionein genes. Recent advances in understanding the control of cellular zinc and copper homeostasis are the foundation for suggesting that mammalian metallothioneins provide a highly dynamic, regulated, and uniquely biological metal buffer to control the availability, fluctuations, and signaling transients of the most competitive Zn(II) and Cu(I) ions in cellular space and time.","154":"Supported single-metal atom catalysts (SACs) are constituted of isolated active metal centers, which are heterogenized on inert supports such as graphene, porous carbon, and metal oxides. Their thermal stability, electronic properties, and catalytic activities can be controlled via interactions between the single-metal atom center and neighboring heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Due to the atomic dispersion of the active catalytic centers, the amount of metal required for catalysis can be decreased, thus offering new possibilities to control the selectivity of a given transformation as well as to improve catalyst turnover frequencies and turnover numbers. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the synthesis of Fe-SACs with a focus on anchoring single atoms (SA) on carbon\/graphene supports. The characterization of these advanced materials using various spectroscopic techniques and their applications in diverse research areas are described. When applicable, mechanistic investigations conducted to understand the specific behavior of Fe-SACs-based catalysts are highlighted, including the use of theoretical models.","155":"","156":"","157":"Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) is a single-particle technique where the masses of individual ions are determined from simultaneous measurement of their mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) and charge. Masses are determined for thousands of individual ions, and then the results are binned to give a mass spectrum. Using this approach, accurate mass distributions can be measured for heterogeneous and high-molecular-weight samples that are usually not amenable to analysis by conventional mass spectrometry. Recent applications include heavily glycosylated proteins, protein complexes, protein aggregates such as amyloid fibers, infectious viruses, gene therapies, vaccines, and vesicles such as exosomes.","158":"Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF) coupled to mass spectrometry has been successfully used to investigate a plethora of protein-related questions. The method, which utilizes hydroxyl radicals to oxidatively modify solvent-accessible amino acids, can inform on protein interaction sites and regions of conformational change. Hydroxyl radical-based footprinting was originally developed to study nucleic acids, but coupling the method with mass spectrometry has enabled the study of proteins. The method has undergone several advancements since its inception that have increased its utility for more varied applications such as protein folding and the study of biotherapeutics. In addition, recent innovations have led to the study of increasingly complex systems including cell lysates and intact cells. Technological advances have also increased throughput and allowed for better control of experimental conditions. In this review, we provide a brief history of the field of HRPF and detail recent innovations and applications in the field.","159":"For more than 70 years, nitrogen-centered radicals have been recognized as potent synthetic intermediates. This review is a survey designed for use by chemists engaged in target-oriented synthesis. This review summarizes the recent paradigm shift in access to and application of N-centered radicals enabled by visible-light photocatalysis. This shift broadens and streamlines approaches to many small molecules because visible-light photocatalysis conditions are mild. Explicit attention is paid to innovative advances in N-X bonds as radical precursors, where X = Cl, N, S, O, and H. For clarity, key mechanistic data is noted, where available. Synthetic applications and limitations are summarized to illuminate the tremendous utility of photocatalytically generated nitrogen-centered radicals.","160":"In recent years, visible light-induced transition metal catalysis has emerged as a new paradigm in organic photocatalysis, which has led to the discovery of unprecedented transformations as well as the improvement of known reactions. In this subfield of photocatalysis, a transition metal complex serves a double duty by harvesting photon energy and then enabling bond forming\/breaking events mostly via a single catalytic cycle, thus contrasting the established dual photocatalysis in which an exogenous photosensitizer is employed. In addition, this approach often synergistically combines catalyst-substrate interaction with photoinduced process, a feature that is uncommon in conventional photoredox chemistry. This Review describes the early development and recent advances of this emerging field.","161":"Organoboron reagents represent a unique class of compounds because of their utility in modern synthetic organic chemistry, often affording unprecedented reactivity. The transformation of the carbon-boron bond into a carbon-X (X = C, N, and O) bond in a stereocontrolled fashion has become invaluable in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and natural products chemistry as well as materials science. Over the past decade, first-row d-block transition metals have become increasingly widely used as catalysts for the formation of a carbon-boron bond, a transformation traditionally catalyzed by expensive precious metals. This recent focus on alternative transition metals has enabled growth in fundamental methods in organoboron chemistry. This review surveys the current state-of-the-art in the use of first-row d-block element-based catalysts for the formation of carbon-boron bonds.","162":"Time-resolved spectroscopy is an essential part of both fundamental and applied chemical research. Such techniques access light-initiated dynamics on time scales ranging from femtosecond to microsecond. Many techniques falling under this description have been applied to gain significant insight into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a diverse class of porous coordination polymers. MOFs are highly tunable, both compositionally and structurally, and unique challenges are encountered in applying time-resolved spectroscopy to interrogate their light-initiated properties. These properties involve various excited state mechanisms such as crystallographically defined energy transfer, charge transfer, and localization within the framework, photoconductivity, and structural dynamics. The field of time-resolved MOF spectroscopic studies is quite nascent; each original report cited in this review was published within the past decade. As such, this review is a timely and comprehensive summary of the most significant contributions in this emerging field, with focuses on the overarching spectroscopic concepts applied and on identifying key challenges and future outlooks moving forward.","163":"Alkoxy radicals are highly reactive species that have long been recognized as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. However, their development has long been impeded due to a lack of convenient methods for their generation. Thanks to advances in photoredox catalysis, enabling facile access to alkoxy radicals from bench-stable precursors and free alcohols under mild conditions, research interest in this field has been renewed. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in alkoxy radical-mediated transformations under visible light irradiation. Elementary steps for alkoxy radical generation from either radical precursors or free alcohols are central to reaction development; thus, each section is categorized and discussed accordingly. Throughout this review, we have focused on the different mechanisms of alkoxy radical generation as well as their impact on synthetic utilizations. Notably, the catalytic generation of alkoxy radicals from abundant alcohols is still in the early stage, providing intriguing opportunities to exploit alkoxy radicals for diverse synthetic paradigms.","164":"Electrochemical detection of metabolites is essential for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of a variety of health conditions. This review focuses on organic electronic material-based metabolite sensors and highlights their potential to tackle critical challenges associated with metabolite detection. We provide an overview of the distinct classes of organic electronic materials and biorecognition units used in metabolite sensors, explain the different detection strategies developed to date, and identify the advantages and drawbacks of each technology. We then benchmark state-of-the-art organic electronic metabolite sensors by categorizing them based on their application area (in vitro, body-interfaced, in vivo, and cell-interfaced). Finally, we share our perspective on using organic bioelectronic materials for metabolite sensing and address the current challenges for the devices and progress to come.","165":"Functional mesoporous materials have gained tremendous attention due to their distinctive properties and potential applications. In recent decades, the self-assembly of micelles and framework precursors into mesostructures on the liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and gas-liquid interface has been explored in the construction of functional mesoporous materials with diverse compositions, morphologies, mesostructures, and pore sizes. Compared with the one-phase solution synthetic approach, the introduction of a two-phase interface in the synthetic system changes self-assembly behaviors between micelles and framework species, leading to the possibility for the on-demand fabrication of unique mesoporous architectures. In addition, controlling the interfacial tension is critical to manipulate the self-assembly process for precise synthesis. In particular, recent breakthroughs based on the concept of the \"monomicelles\" assembly mechanism are very promising and interesting for the synthesis of functional mesoporous materials with the precise control. In this review, we highlight the synthetic strategies, principles, and interface engineering at the macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale for oriented interfacial assembly of functional mesoporous materials over the past 10 years. The potential applications in various fields, including adsorption, separation, sensors, catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and biomedicine, are discussed. Finally, we also propose the remaining challenges, possible directions, and opportunities in this field for the future outlook.","166":"The applications of fluorinated molecules in bioengineering and nanotechnology are expanding rapidly with the controlled introduction of fluorine being broadly studied due to the unique properties of C-F bonds. This review will focus on the design and utility of C-F containing materials in imaging, therapeutics, and environmental applications with a central theme being the importance of controlling fluorine-fluorine interactions and understanding how such interactions impact biological behavior. Low natural abundance of fluorine is shown to provide sensitivity and background advantages for imaging and detection of a variety of diseases with 19F magnetic resonance imaging, 18F positron emission tomography and ultrasound discussed as illustrative examples. The presence of C-F bonds can also be used to tailor membrane permeability and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and delivery agents for enhanced cell uptake and therapeutics. A key message of this review is that while the promise of C-F containing materials is significant, a subset of highly fluorinated compounds such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), have been identified as posing a potential risk to human health. The unique properties of the C-F bond and the significant potential for fluorine-fluorine interactions in PFAS structures necessitate the development of new strategies for facile and efficient environmental removal and remediation. Recent progress in the development of fluorine-containing compounds as molecular imaging and therapeutic agents will be reviewed and their design features contrasted with environmental and health risks for PFAS systems. Finally, present challenges and future directions in the exploitation of the biological aspects of fluorinated systems will be described.","167":"Asymmetric catalysis is a major theme of research in contemporary synthetic organic chemistry. The discovery of general strategies for highly enantioselective photochemical reactions, however, has been a relatively recent development, and the variety of photoreactions that can be conducted in a stereocontrolled manner is consequently somewhat limited. Asymmetric photocatalysis is complicated by the short lifetimes and high reactivities characteristic of photogenerated reactive intermediates; the design of catalyst architectures that can provide effective enantiodifferentiating environments for these intermediates while minimizing the participation of uncontrolled racemic background processes has proven to be a key challenge for progress in this field. This review provides a summary of the chiral catalyst structures that have been studied for solution-phase asymmetric photochemistry, including chiral organic sensitizers, inorganic chromophores, and soluble macromolecules. While some of these photocatalysts are derived from privileged catalyst structures that are effective for both ground-state and photochemical transformations, others are structural designs unique to photocatalysis and offer insight into the logic required for highly effective stereocontrolled photocatalysis.","168":"Nucleic acids have been among the first targets for antitumor drugs and antibiotics. With the unveiling of new biological roles in regulation of gene expression, specific DNA and RNA structures have become very attractive targets, especially when the corresponding proteins are undruggable. Biophysical assays to assess target structure as well as ligand binding stoichiometry, affinity, specificity, and binding modes are part of the drug development process. Mass spectrometry offers unique advantages as a biophysical method owing to its ability to distinguish each stoichiometry present in a mixture. In addition, advanced mass spectrometry approaches (reactive probing, fragmentation techniques, ion mobility spectrometry, ion spectroscopy) provide more detailed information on the complexes. Here, we review the fundamentals of mass spectrometry and all its particularities when studying noncovalent nucleic acid structures, and then review what has been learned thanks to mass spectrometry on nucleic acid structures, self-assemblies (e.g., duplexes or G-quadruplexes), and their complexes with ligands.","169":"Our ability to detect, image, and quantify nanoscopic objects and molecules with visible light has undergone dramatic improvements over the past few decades. While fluorescence has historically been the go-to contrast mechanism for ultrasensitive light microscopy due to its superior background suppression and specificity, recent developments based on light scattering have reached single-molecule sensitivity. They also have the advantages of universal applicability and the ability to obtain information about the species of interest beyond its presence and location. Many of the recent advances are driven by novel approaches to illumination, detection, and background suppression, all aimed at isolating and maximizing the signal of interest. Here, we review these developments grouped according to the basic principles used, namely darkfield imaging, interferometric detection, and surface plasmon resonance microscopy.","170":"Triazines are an important class of six-membered aromatic heterocycles possessing three nitrogen atoms, resulting in three types of regio-isomers: 1,2,4-triazines (a-triazines), 1,2,3-triazines (v-triazines), and 1,3,5-triazines (s-triazines). Notably, the application of triazines as cyclic aza-dienes in inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) cycloaddition reactions has been established as a unique and powerful method in N-heterocycle synthesis, natural product preparation, and bioorthogonal chemistry. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the advances in the construction of these triazines via annulation and ring-expansion reactions, especially emphasizing recent developments and challenges. The synthetic transformations of triazines are focused on IEDDA cycloaddition reactions, which have allowed access to a wide scope of heterocycles, including pyridines, carbolines, azepines, pyridazines, pyrazines, and pyrimidines. The utilization of triazine IEDDA reactions as key steps in natural product synthesis is also discussed. More importantly, a particular attention is paid on the bioorthogonal application of triazines in fast click ligation with various strained alkenes and alkynes, which opens a new opportunity for studying biomolecules in chemical biology.","171":null,"172":"This review presents a robust strategy to design photosensitizers (PSs) for various species. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemical-based treatment approach that involves the use of light combined with a light-activated chemical, referred to as a PS. Attractively, PDT is one of the alternatives to conventional cancer treatment due to its noninvasive nature, high cure rates, and low side effects. PSs play an important factor in photoinduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Although the concept of photosensitizer-based photodynamic therapy has been widely adopted for clinical trials and bioimaging, until now, to our surprise, there has been no relevant review article on rational designs of organic PSs for PDT. Furthermore, most of published review articles in PDT focused on nanomaterials and nanotechnology based on traditional PSs. Therefore, this review aimed at reporting recent strategies to develop innovative organic photosensitizers for enhanced photodynamic therapy, with each example described in detail instead of providing only a general overview, as is typically done in previous reviews of PDT, to provide intuitive, vivid, and specific insights to the readers.","173":"The plasma membrane (PM) is often described as a wall, a physical barrier separating the cell cytoplasm from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Yet, this wall is a highly dynamic structure that can stretch, bend, and bud, allowing cells to respond and adapt to their surrounding environment. Inspired by shapes and geometries found in the biological world and exploiting the intrinsic properties of conductive polymers (CPs), several biomimetic strategies based on substrate dimensionality have been tailored in order to optimize the cell-chip coupling. Furthermore, device biofunctionalization through the use of ECM proteins or lipid bilayers have proven successful approaches to further maximize interfacial interactions. As the bio-electronic field aims at narrowing the gap between the electronic and the biological world, the possibility of effectively disguising conductive materials to \"trick\" cells to recognize artificial devices as part of their biological environment is a promising approach on the road to the seamless platform integration with cells.","174":"Gold nanorods (NRs), pseudo-one-dimensional rod-shaped nanoparticles (NPs), have become one of the burgeoning materials in the recent years due to their anisotropic shape and adjustable plasmonic properties. With the continuous improvement in synthetic methods, a variety of materials have been attached around Au NRs to achieve unexpected or improved plasmonic properties and explore state-of-the-art technologies. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest progress on Au NRs, the most versatile anisotropic plasmonic NPs. We present a representative overview of the advances in the synthetic strategies and outline an extensive catalogue of Au-NR-based heterostructures with tailored architectures and special functionalities. The bottom-up assembly of Au NRs into preprogrammed metastructures is then discussed, as well as the design principles. We also provide a systematic elucidation of the different plasmonic properties associated with the Au-NR-based structures, followed by a discussion of the promising applications of Au NRs in various fields. We finally discuss the future research directions and challenges of Au NRs.","175":"In the pursuit of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, chemists in the life science industry require access to mild and robust synthetic methodologies to systematically modify chemical structures, explore novel chemical space, and enable efficient synthesis. In this context, photocatalysis has emerged as a powerful technology for the synthesis of complex and often highly functionalized molecules. This Review aims to summarize the published contributions to the field from the life science industry, including research from industrial-academic partnerships. An overview of the synthetic methodologies developed and strategic applications in chemical synthesis, including peptide functionalization, isotope labeling, and both DNA-encoded and traditional library synthesis, is provided, along with a summary of the state-of-the-art in photoreactor technology and the effective upscaling of photocatalytic reactions.","176":"Optical imaging is an indispensable tool in clinical diagnostics and fundamental biomedical research. Autofluorescence-free optical imaging, which eliminates real-time optical excitation to minimize background noise, enables clear visualization of biological architecture and physiopathological events deep within living subjects. Molecular probes especially developed for autofluorescence-free optical imaging have been proven to remarkably improve the imaging sensitivity, penetration depth, target specificity, and multiplexing capability. In this Review, we focus on the advancements of autofluorescence-free molecular probes through the lens of particular molecular or photophysical mechanisms that produce long-lasting luminescence after the cessation of light excitation. The versatile design strategies of these molecular probes are discussed along with a broad range of biological applications. Finally, challenges and perspectives are discussed to further advance the next-generation autofluorescence-free molecular probes for in vivo imaging and in vitro biosensors.","177":"","178":null,"179":"Molecular photoactuators can control shape and chemical or physical properties of the responsive system they are embedded in. These effects are usually mediated by supramolecular interactions and can be amplified to perform work at the micro- and macroscopic scale, for instance, in materials and biomimetic systems. While many studies focus on the observable outcome of these events, photoresponsive structures can also translate their conformational change to molecular components and perform work against random Brownian motion. Stereochemical cascades can amplify light-generated motion to a distant moiety of the same molecule or molecular assembly, via conformationally restricted stereogenic elements. Being able to control the conformation or motion of molecular systems remotely provides prospects for the design of the smallest machines imaginable. This Focus Review emphasizes the emergence of directed, coupled motion of remote functionalities triggered by light-powered switches and motors as a tool to control molecular topology and function.","180":"In the past few years, many exciting papers reported results based on crystal structure determination by electron diffraction. The aim of this review is to provide general and practical information to structural chemists interested in stepping into this emerging field. We discuss technical characteristics of electron microscopes for research units that would like to acquire their own instrumentation, as well as those practical aspects that appear different between X-ray and electron crystallography.

It intends to create both accessibility of these tools to the chemistry and electrochemical energy sciences communities and completeness in terms of the different battery R&amp;D aspects covered.","182":"Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen generation is a promising pathway for renewable energy conversion and storage. One of the most important issues for efficient water splitting is to develop cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts to drive sluggish oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side. Notably, structural transformation such as surface oxidation of metals or metal nonoxide compounds and surface amorphization of some metal oxides during OER have attracted growing attention in recent years. The investigation of structural transformation in OER will contribute to the in-depth understanding of accurate catalytic mechanisms and will finally benefit the rational design of catalytic materials with high activity. In this Review, we provide an overview of heterogeneous materials with obvious structural transformation during OER electrocatalysis. To gain insight into the essence of structural transformation, we summarize the driving forces and critical factors that affect the transformation process. In addition, advanced techniques that are used to probe chemical states and atomic structures of transformed surfaces are also introduced. We then discuss the structure of active species and the relationship between catalytic performance and structural properties of transformed materials. Finally, the challenges and prospects of heterogeneous OER electrocatalysis are presented.","183":null,"184":"Peptide-based supramolecular systems chemistry seeks to mimic the ability of life forms to use conserved sets of building blocks and chemical reactions to achieve a bewildering array of functions. Building on the design principles for short peptide-based nanomaterials with properties, such as self-assembly, recognition, catalysis, and actuation, are increasingly available. Peptide-based supramolecular systems chemistry is starting to address the far greater challenge of systems-level design to access complex functions that emerge when multiple reactions and interactions are coordinated and integrated. We discuss key features relevant to systems-level design, including regulating supramolecular order and disorder, development of active and adaptive systems by considering kinetic and thermodynamic design aspects and combinatorial dynamic covalent and noncovalent interactions. Finally, we discuss how structural and dynamic design concepts, including preorganization and induced fit, are critical to the ability to develop adaptive materials with adaptive and tunable photonic, electronic, and catalytic properties. Finally, we highlight examples where multiple features are combined, resulting in chemical systems and materials that display adaptive properties that cannot be achieved without this level of integration.","185":"Mass spectrometry (MS) is increasingly being used to probe the structure and dynamics of proteins and the complexes they form with other macromolecules. There are now several specialized MS methods, each with unique sample preparation, data acquisition, and data processing protocols. Collectively, these methods are referred to as structural MS and include cross-linking, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, hydroxyl radical footprinting, native, ion mobility, and top-down MS. Each of these provides a unique type of structural information, ranging from composition and stoichiometry through to residue level proximity and solvent accessibility. Structural MS has proved particularly beneficial in studying protein classes for which analysis by classic structural biology techniques proves challenging such as glycosylated or intrinsically disordered proteins. To capture the structural details for a particular system, especially larger multiprotein complexes, more than one structural MS method with other structural and biophysical techniques is often required. Key to integrating these diverse data are computational strategies and software solutions to facilitate this process. We provide a background to the structural MS methods and briefly summarize other structural methods and how these are combined with MS. We then describe current state of the art approaches for the integration of structural MS data for structural biology. We quantify how often these methods are used together and provide examples where such combinations have been fruitful. To illustrate the power of integrative approaches, we discuss progress in solving the structures of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex. We also discuss how information from structural MS, particularly pertaining to protein dynamics, is not currently utilized in integrative workflows and how such information can provide a more accurate picture of the systems studied. We conclude by discussing new developments in the MS and computational fields that will further enable in-cell structural studies.","186":"Solution-phase hydrogen\/deuterium exchange (HDX) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) is a widespread tool for structural analysis across academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. By monitoring the exchangeability of backbone amide protons, HDX-MS can reveal information about higher-order structure and dynamics throughout a protein, can track protein folding pathways, map interaction sites, and assess conformational states of protein samples. The combination of the versatility of the hydrogen\/deuterium exchange reaction with the sensitivity of mass spectrometry has enabled the study of extremely challenging protein systems, some of which cannot be suitably studied using other techniques. Improvements over the past three decades have continually increased throughput, robustness, and expanded the limits of what is feasible for HDX-MS investigations. To provide an overview for researchers seeking to utilize and derive the most from HDX-MS for protein structural analysis, we summarize the fundamental principles, basic methodology, strengths and weaknesses, and the established applications of HDX-MS while highlighting new developments and applications.","187":"Optically variable devices (OVDs) are in tremendous demand as optical indicators against the increasing threat of counterfeiting. Conventional OVDs are exposed to the danger of fraudulent replication with advances in printing technology and widespread copying methods of security features. Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength structures known as meta-atoms, have been nominated as a candidate for a new generation of OVDs as they exhibit exceptional behaviors that can provide a more robust solution for optical anti-counterfeiting. Unlike conventional OVDs, metasurface-driven OVDs (mOVDs) can contain multiple optical responses in a single device, making them difficult to reverse engineered. Well-known examples of mOVDs include ultrahigh-resolution structural color printing, various types of holography, and polarization encoding. In this review, we discuss the new generation of mOVDs. The fundamentals of plasmonic and dielectric metasurfaces are presented to explain how the optical responses of metasurfaces can be manipulated. Then, examples of monofunctional, tunable, and multifunctional mOVDs are discussed. We follow up with a discussion of the fabrication methods needed to realize these mOVDs, classified into prototyping and manufacturing techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook and classification of mOVDs with respect to their capacity and security level. We believe this newly proposed concept of OVDs may bring about a new era of optical anticounterfeit technology leveraging the novel concepts of nano-optics and nanotechnology.","188":"Cells encode information in the sequence of biopolymers, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and glycans. Although glycans are essential to all living organisms, surprisingly little is known about the \"sugar code\" and the biological roles of these molecules. The reason glycobiology lags behind its counterparts dealing with nucleic acids and proteins lies in the complexity of carbohydrate structures, which renders their analysis extremely challenging. Building blocks that may differ only in the configuration of a single stereocenter, combined with the vast possibilities to connect monosaccharide units, lead to an immense variety of isomers, which poses a formidable challenge to conventional mass spectrometry. In recent years, however, a combination of innovative ion activation methods, commercialization of ion mobility-mass spectrometry, progress in gas-phase ion spectroscopy, and advances in computational chemistry have led to a revolution in mass spectrometry-based glycan analysis. The present review focuses on the above techniques that expanded the traditional glycomics toolkit and provided spectacular insight into the structure of these fascinating biomolecules. To emphasize the specific challenges associated with them, major classes of mammalian glycans are discussed in separate sections. By doing so, we aim to put the spotlight on the most important element of glycobiology: the glycans themselves.","189":null,"190":"Hydrogels are highly water-swollen molecular networks that are ideal platforms to create tissue mimetics owing to their vast and tunable properties. As such, hydrogels are promising cell-delivery vehicles for applications in tissue engineering and have also emerged as an important base for ex vivo models to study healthy and pathophysiological events in a carefully controlled three-dimensional environment. Cells are readily encapsulated in hydrogels resulting in a plethora of biochemical and mechanical communication mechanisms, which recapitulates the natural cell and extracellular matrix interaction in tissues. These interactions are complex, with multiple events that are invariably coupled and spanning multiple length and time scales. To study and identify the underlying mechanisms involved, an integrated experimental and computational approach is ideally needed. This review discusses the state of our knowledge on cell-hydrogel interactions, with a focus on mechanics and transport, and in this context, highlights recent advancements in experiments, mathematical and computational modeling. The review begins with a background on the thermodynamics and physics fundamentals that govern hydrogel mechanics and transport. The review focuses on two main classes of hydrogels, described as semiflexible polymer networks that represent physically cross-linked fibrous hydrogels and flexible polymer networks representing the chemically cross-linked synthetic and natural hydrogels. In this review, we highlight five main cell-hydrogel interactions that involve key cellular functions related to communication, mechanosensing, migration, growth, and tissue deposition and elaboration. For each of these cellular functions, recent experiments and the most up to date modeling strategies are discussed and then followed by a summary of how to tune hydrogel properties to achieve a desired functional cellular outcome. We conclude with a summary linking these advancements and make the case for the need to integrate experiments and modeling to advance our fundamental understanding of cell-matrix interactions that will ultimately help identify new therapeutic approaches and enable successful tissue engineering.","191":"Native mass spectrometry (MS) is aimed at preserving and determining the native structure, composition, and stoichiometry of biomolecules and their complexes from solution after they are transferred into the gas phase. Major improvements in native MS instrumentation and experimental methods over the past few decades have led to a concomitant increase in the complexity and heterogeneity of samples that can be analyzed, including protein-ligand complexes, protein complexes with multiple coexisting stoichiometries, and membrane protein-lipid assemblies. Heterogeneous features of these biomolecular samples can be important for understanding structure and function. However, sample heterogeneity can make assignment of ion mass, charge, composition, and structure very challenging due to the overlap of tens or even hundreds of peaks in the mass spectrum. In this review, we cover data analysis, experimental, and instrumental advances and strategies aimed at solving this problem, with an in-depth discussion of theoretical and practical aspects of the use of available deconvolution algorithms and tools. We also reflect upon current challenges and provide a view of the future of this exciting field.","192":"This review serves to document advances in the synthesis, versatile bonding, and reactivity of molecular main group metal hydrides within Groups 1, 2, and 12-16.

While this review is comprehensive in nature, focus will be given to research appearing in the open literature since 2001.","193":"Small molecule drug discovery has been propelled by the continual development of novel scientific methodologies to occasion therapeutic advances. Although established biophysical methods can be used to obtain information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying drug action, these approaches are often inefficient, low throughput, and ineffective in the analysis of heterogeneous systems including dynamic oligomeric assemblies and proteins that have undergone extensive post-translational modification. Native mass spectrometry can be used to probe protein-small molecule interactions with unprecedented speed and sensitivity, providing unique insights into polydisperse biomolecular systems that are commonly encountered during the drug discovery process. In this review, we describe potential and proven applications of native MS in the study of interactions between small, drug-like molecules and proteins, including large multiprotein complexes and membrane proteins. Approaches to quantify the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of ligand binding are discussed, alongside a summary of gas-phase ion activation techniques that have been used to interrogate the structure of protein-small molecule complexes. We additionally highlight some of the key areas in modern drug design for which native mass spectrometry has elicited significant advances. Future developments and applications of native mass spectrometry in drug discovery workflows are identified, including potential pathways toward studying protein-small molecule interactions on a whole-proteome scale.","194":null,"195":"Microplastics and nanoplastics have become emerging particulate anthropogenic pollutants and rapidly turned into a field of growing scientific and public interest. These tiny plastic particles are found in the environment all around the globe as well as in drinking water and food, raising concerns about their impacts on the environment and human health. To adequately address these issues, reliable information on the ambient concentrations of microplastics and nanoplastics is needed. However, micro- and nanoplastic particles are extremely complex and diverse in terms of their size, shape, density, polymer type, surface properties, etc. While the particle concentrations in different media can vary by up to 10 orders of magnitude, analysis of such complex samples may resemble searching for a needle in a haystack. This highlights the critical importance of appropriate methods for the chemical identification, quantification, and characterization of microplastics and nanoplastics. The present article reviews advanced methods for the representative mass-based and particle-based analysis of microplastics, with a focus on the sensitivity and lower-size limit for detection. The advantages and limitations of the methods, and their complementarity for the comprehensive characterization of microplastics are discussed. A special attention is paid to the approaches for reliable analysis of nanoplastics. Finally, an outlook for establishing harmonized and standardized methods to analyze these challenging contaminants is presented, and perspectives within and beyond this research field are discussed.","196":"","197":"Hydrogen-bonded liquid crystalline polymers have emerged as promising \"smart\" supramolecular functional materials with stimuli-responsive, self-healing, and recyclable properties. The hydrogen bonds can either be used as chemically responsive (i.e., pH-responsive) or as dynamic structural (i.e., temperature-responsive) moieties. Responsiveness can be manifested as changes in shape, color, or porosity and as selective binding. The liquid crystalline self-organization gives the materials their unique responsive nanostructures. Typically, the materials used for actuators or optical materials are constructed using linear calamitic (rod-shaped) hydrogen-bonded complexes, while nanoporous materials are constructed from either calamitic or discotic (disk-shaped) complexes. The dynamic structural character of the hydrogen bond moieties can be used to construct self-healing and recyclable supramolecular materials. In this review, recent findings are summarized, and potential future applications are discussed.","198":"All implanted biomaterials are targets of the host's immune system. While the host inflammatory response was once considered a detrimental force to be blunted or avoided, in recent years, it has become a powerful force to be leveraged to augment biomaterial-tissue integration and tissue repair. In this review, we will discuss the major immune cells that mediate the inflammatory response to biomaterials, with a focus on how biomaterials can be designed to modulate immune cell behavior to promote biomaterial-tissue integration. In particular, the intentional activation of monocytes and macrophages with controlled timing, and modulation of their interactions with other cell types involved in wound healing, have emerged as key strategies to improve biomaterial efficacy. To this end, careful design of biomaterial structure and controlled release of immunomodulators can be employed to manipulate macrophage phenotype for the maximization of the wound healing response with enhanced tissue integration and repair, as opposed to a typical foreign body response characterized by fibrous encapsulation and implant isolation. We discuss current challenges in the clinical translation of immunomodulatory biomaterials, such as limitations in the use of in vitro studies and animal models to model the human immune response. Finally, we describe future directions and opportunities for understanding and controlling the biomaterial-immune system interface, including the application of new imaging tools, new animal models, the discovery of new cellular targets, and novel techniques for in situ immune cell reprogramming.","199":"This review considers the most recent developments in supramolecular and supraparticle structures obtained from natural, renewable biopolymers as well as their disassembly and reassembly into engineered materials. We introduce the main interactions that control bottom-up synthesis and top-down design at different length scales, highlighting the promise of natural biopolymers and associated building blocks. The latter have become main actors in the recent surge of the scientific and patent literature related to the subject. Such developments make prominent use of multicomponent and hierarchical polymeric assemblies and structures that contain polysaccharides (cellulose, chitin, and others), polyphenols (lignins, tannins), and proteins (soy, whey, silk, and other proteins). We offer a comprehensive discussion about the interactions that exist in their native architectures (including multicomponent and composite forms), the chemical modification of polysaccharides and their deconstruction into high axial aspect nanofibers and nanorods. We reflect on the availability and suitability of the latter types of building blocks to enable superstructures and colloidal associations. As far as processing, we describe the most relevant transitions, from the solution to the gel state and the routes that can be used to arrive to consolidated materials with prescribed properties. We highlight the implementation of supramolecular and superstructures in different technological fields that exploit the synergies exhibited by renewable polymers and biocolloids integrated in structured materials.","200":"Native mass spectrometry (MS) involves the analysis and characterization of macromolecules, predominantly intact proteins and protein complexes, whereby as much as possible the native structural features of the analytes are retained. As such, native MS enables the study of secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structure of proteins and other biomolecules. Native MS represents a relatively recent addition to the analytical toolbox of mass spectrometry and has over the past decade experienced immense growth, especially in enhancing sensitivity and resolving power but also in ease of use. With the advent of dedicated mass analyzers, sample preparation and separation approaches, targeted fragmentation techniques, and software solutions, the number of practitioners and novel applications has risen in both academia and industry. This review focuses on recent developments, particularly in high-resolution native MS, describing applications in the structural analysis of protein assemblies, proteoform profiling of-among others-biopharmaceuticals and plasma proteins, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of protein-ligand interactions, with the latter covering lipid, drug, and carbohydrate molecules, to name a few.","201":"Smart materials are a kind of functional materials which can sense and response to environmental conditions or stimuli from optical, electrical, magnetic mechanical, thermal, and chemical signals, etc. Patterning of smart materials is the key to achieving large-scale arrays of functional devices. Over the last decades, printing methods including inkjet printing, template-assisted printing, and 3D printing are extensively investigated and utilized in fabricating intelligent micro\/nano devices, as printing strategies allow for constructing multidimensional and multimaterial architectures. Great strides in printable smart materials are opening new possibilities for functional devices to better serve human beings, such as wearable sensors, integrated optoelectronics, artificial neurons, and so on. However, there are still many challenges and drawbacks that need to be overcome in order to achieve the controllable modulation between smart materials and device performance. In this review, we give an overview on printable smart materials, printing strategies, and applications of printed functional devices. In addition, the advantages in actual practices of printing smart materials-based devices are discussed, and the current limitations and future opportunities are proposed. This review aims to summarize the recent progress and provide reference for novel smart materials and printing strategies as well as applications of intelligent devices.","202":"Biological mass spectrometry (MS) encompasses a range of methods for characterizing proteins and other biomolecules. MS is uniquely powerful for the structural analysis of endogenous protein complexes, which are often heterogeneous, poorly abundant, and refractive to characterization by other methods. Here, we focus on how biological MS can contribute to the study of endogenous protein complexes, which we define as complexes expressed in the physiological host and purified intact, as opposed to reconstituted complexes assembled from heterologously expressed components. Biological MS can yield information on complex stoichiometry, heterogeneity, topology, stability, activity, modes of regulation, and even structural dynamics. We begin with a review of methods for isolating endogenous complexes. We then describe the various biological MS approaches, focusing on the type of information that each method yields. We end with future directions and challenges for these MS-based methods.","203":null,"204":"Proteins are nature's primary building blocks for the construction of sophisticated molecular machines and dynamic materials, ranging from protein complexes such as photosystem II and nitrogenase that drive biogeochemical cycles to cytoskeletal assemblies and muscle fibers for motion. Such natural systems have inspired extensive efforts in the rational design of artificial protein assemblies in the last two decades. As molecular building blocks, proteins are highly complex, in terms of both their three-dimensional structures and chemical compositions. To enable control over the self-assembly of such complex molecules, scientists have devised many creative strategies by combining tools and principles of experimental and computational biophysics, supramolecular chemistry, inorganic chemistry, materials science, and polymer chemistry, among others. Owing to these innovative strategies, what started as a purely structure-building exercise two decades ago has, in short order, led to artificial protein assemblies with unprecedented structures and functions and protein-based materials with unusual properties. Our goal in this review is to give an overview of this exciting and highly interdisciplinary area of research, first outlining the design strategies and tools that have been devised for controlling protein self-assembly, then describing the diverse structures of artificial protein assemblies, and finally highlighting the emergent properties and functions of these assemblies.","205":"Methods to functionalize arenes and heteroarenes in a site-selective manner are highly sought after for rapidly constructing value-added molecules of medicinal, agrochemical, and materials interest. One effective approach is the site-selective cross-coupling of polyhalogenated arenes bearing multiple, but identical, halogen groups. Such cross-coupling reactions have proven to be incredibly effective for site-selective functionalization. However, they also present formidable challenges due to the inherent similarities in the reactivities of the halogen substituents. In this Review, we discuss strategies for site-selective cross-couplings of polyhalogenated arenes and heteroarenes bearing identical halogens, beginning first with an overview of the reaction types that are more traditional in nature, such as electronically, sterically, and directing-group-controlled processes. Following these examples is a description of emerging strategies, which includes ligand- and additive\/solvent-controlled reactions as well as photochemically initiated processes.","206":"We provide an introduction to Gaussian process regression (GPR) machine-learning methods in computational materials science and chemistry. The focus of the present review is on the regression of atomistic properties: in particular, on the construction of interatomic potentials, or force fields, in the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework; beyond this, we also discuss the fitting of arbitrary scalar, vectorial, and tensorial quantities. Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field. A vision is outlined for the development of the methodology in the years to come.","207":"Chemical compound space (CCS), the set of all theoretically conceivable combinations of chemical elements and (meta-)stable geometries that make up matter, is colossal. The first-principles based virtual sampling of this space, for example, in search of novel molecules or materials which exhibit desirable properties, is therefore prohibitive for all but the smallest subsets and simplest properties. We review studies aimed at tackling this challenge using modern machine learning techniques based on (i) synthetic data, typically generated using quantum mechanics based methods, and (ii) model architectures inspired by quantum mechanics. Such Quantum mechanics based Machine Learning (QML) approaches combine the numerical efficiency of statistical surrogate models with an ab initio view on matter. They rigorously reflect the underlying physics in order to reach universality and transferability across CCS. While state-of-the-art approximations to quantum problems impose severe computational bottlenecks, recent QML based developments indicate the possibility of substantial acceleration without sacrificing the predictive power of quantum mechanics.","208":"As the \"chemical chameleon\", sulfonyl-containing compounds and their variants have been merged with various types of reactions for the efficient construction of diverse molecular architectures by taking advantage of their incredible reactive flexibility. Currently, their involvement in radical transformations, in which the sulfonyl group typically acts as a leaving group via selective C-S, N-S, O-S, S-S, and Se-S bond cleavage\/functionalization, has facilitated new bond formation strategies which are complementary to classical two-electron cross-couplings via organometallic or ionic intermediates. Considering the great influence and synthetic potential of these novel avenues, we summarize recent advances in this rapidly expanding area by discussing the reaction designs, substrate scopes, mechanistic studies, and their limitations, outlining the state-of-the-art processes involved in radical-mediated desulfonylation and related transformations. With a specific emphasis on their synthetic applications, we believe this review will be useful for medicinal and synthetic organic chemists who are interested in radical chemistry and radical-mediated desulfonylation in particular.","209":"Merging hydrogen (H2) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis in a semiconductor-mediated photoredox reaction is extremely attractive because the clean H2 fuel and high-value chemicals can be coproduced under mild conditions using light as the sole energy input.

In this review, we begin by presenting a concise overview on the general background of traditional photocatalytic H2 production and then focus on the fundamental principles of cooperative photoredox coupling of selective organic synthesis and H2 production by simultaneous utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes over semiconductor-based catalysts to meet the economic and sustainability goal. Thereafter, we put dedicated emphasis on recent key progress of cooperative photoredox coupling of H2 production and various selective organic transformations, including selective alcohol oxidation, selective methane conversion, amines oxidative coupling, oxidative cross-coupling, cyclic alkanes dehydrogenation, reforming of lignocellulosic biomass, and so on. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives in this flourishing area have been critically discussed.

For adsorption-based gas separations and carbon capture, recent efforts have been directed toward the development of multiscale and performance-based screening workflows where we can go from the atomistic structure of an adsorbent to its equilibrium and transport properties at different scales, and eventually to its separation performance at the process level. The objective of this work is to review the current status of this new approach, discuss its potential and impact on the field of materials screening, and highlight the challenges that limit its application. We compile and introduce all the elements required for the development, implementation, and operation of multiscale workflows, hence providing a useful practical guide and a comprehensive source of reference to the scientific communities who work in this area. Our review includes information about available materials databases, state-of-the-art molecular simulation and process modeling tools, and a complete catalogue of data and parameters that are required at each stage of the multiscale screening.

In this manifold, a photocatalyst (PCHAT) exploits the energy of a photon to trigger the homolytic cleavage of such bonds in organic compounds. Selective C-H bond elaboration may be achieved by a judicious choice of the hydrogen abstractor (key parameters are the electronic character and the molecular structure), as well as reaction additives. Different are the classes of PCsHAT available, including aromatic ketones, xanthene dyes (Eosin Y), polyoxometalates, uranyl salts, a metal-oxo porphyrin and a tris(amino)cyclopropenium radical dication.

To develop synthetic materials that can mimic and surpass the function of these natural counterparts, various sequence-defined bio- and biomimetic polymers have been developed and exploited as building blocks for hierarchical self-assembly. This review summarizes the recent advances in the molecular self-assembly of hierarchical nanomaterials based on peptoids (or poly-N-substituted glycines) and other sequence-defined synthetic polymers. Modern techniques to monitor the assembly mechanisms and characterize the physicochemical properties of these self-assembly systems are highlighted. In addition, discussions about their potential applications in biomedical sciences and renewable energy are also included.

Except for energy-related compounds, carbohydrates can be roughly divided into two categories: Carbohydrates as matter and carbohydrates as information. As matter, carbohydrates are abundantly present in the extracellular matrix of animals and cell walls of various plants, bacteria, fungi, etc., serving as scaffolds. Some commonly found polysaccharides are featured as biocompatible materials with controllable rigidity and functionality, forming polymeric biomaterials which are widely used in drug delivery, tissue engineering, etc. As information, carbohydrates are usually referred to the glycans from glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans, which bind to proteins or other carbohydrates, thereby meditating the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. These glycans could be simplified as synthetic glycopolymers, glycolipids, and glycoproteins, which could be afforded through polymerization, multistep synthesis, or a semisynthetic strategy. The information role of carbohydrates can be demonstrated not only as targeting reagents but also as immune antigens and adjuvants. The latter are also included in this review as they are always in a macromolecular formulation. In this review, we intend to provide a relatively comprehensive summary of carbohydrate-based macromolecular biomaterials since 2010 while emphasizing the fundamental understanding to guide the rational design of biomaterials. Carbohydrate-based macromolecules on the basis of their resources and chemical structures will be discussed, including naturally occurring polysaccharides, naturally derived synthetic polysaccharides, glycopolymers\/glycodendrimers, supramolecular glycopolymers, and synthetic glycolipids\/glycoproteins. Multiscale structure-function relationships in several major application areas, including delivery systems, tissue engineering, and immunology, will be detailed.

Knowledge gained from research into the principles of molecular self-assembly drives innovation in the biological, chemical, and materials sciences. Self-assembly processes span a wide range of temporal and spatial domains and are often unintuitive and complex. Studying such complex processes requires an arsenal of analytical and computational tools. Within this arsenal, the transmission electron microscope stands out for its unique ability to visualize and quantify self-assembly structures and processes. This review describes the contribution that the transmission electron microscope has made to the field of molecular self-assembly. An emphasis is placed on which TEM methods are applicable to different structures and processes and how TEM can be used in combination with other experimental or computational methods. Finally, we provide an outlook on the current challenges to, and opportunities for, increasing the impact that the transmission electron microscope can have on molecular self-assembly.","218":"Opportunities for enhancing solar energy harvesting using photon upconversion are reviewed. The increasing prominence of bifacial solar cells is an enabling factor for the implementation of upconversion, however, when the realistic constraints of current best-performing silicon devices are considered, many challenges remain before silicon photovoltaics operating under nonconcentrated sunlight can be enhanced via lanthanide-based upconversion. A photophysical model reveals that &gt;1-2 orders of magnitude increase in the intermediate state lifetime, energy transfer rate, or generation rate would be needed before such solar upconversion could start to become efficient. Methods to increase the generation rate such as the use of cosensitizers to expand the absorption range and the use of plasmonics or photonic structures are reviewed. The opportunities and challenges for these approaches (or combinations thereof) to achieve efficient solar upconversion are discussed. The opportunity for enhancing the performance of technologies such as luminescent solar concentrators by combining upconversion together with micro-optics is also reviewed. Triplet-triplet annihilation-based upconversion is progressing steadily toward being relevant to lower-bandgap solar cells. Looking toward photocatalysis, photophysical modeling indicates that current blue-to-ultraviolet lanthanide upconversion systems are very inefficient. However, hope remains in this direction for organic upconversion enhancing the performance of visible-light-active photocatalysts.","219":"Life at the molecular level is a dynamic world, where the key players-proteins, oligonucleotides, lipids, and carbohydrates-are in a perpetual state of structural flux, shifting rapidly between local minima on their conformational free energy landscapes. The techniques of classical structural biology, X-ray crystallography, structural NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), while capable of extraordinary structural resolution, are innately ill-suited to characterize biomolecules in their dynamically active states. Subsecond time-resolved mass spectrometry (MS) provides a unique window into the dynamic world of biological macromolecules, offering the capacity to directly monitor biochemical processes and conformational shifts with a structural dimension provided by the electrospray charge-state distribution, ion mobility, covalent labeling, or hydrogen-deuterium exchange. Over the past two decades, this suite of techniques has provided important insights into the inherently dynamic processes that drive function and pathogenesis in biological macromolecules, including (mis)folding, complexation, aggregation, ligand binding, and enzyme catalysis, among others. This Review provides a comprehensive account of subsecond time-resolved MS and the advances it has enabled in dynamic structural biology, with an emphasis on insights into the dynamic drivers of protein function.","220":"Rechargeable metal\/O2 batteries have long been considered a promising future battery technology in automobile and stationary applications. However, they suffer from poor cyclability and rapid degradation. A recent hypothesis is the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2) as the root cause of these issues. Validation, evaluation, and understanding of the formation of 1O2 are therefore essential for improving metal\/O2 batteries. We review literature and use Marcus theory to discuss the possibility of singlet oxygen formation in metal\/O2 batteries as a product from (electro)chemical reactions. We conclude that experimental evidence is yet not fully conclusive, and side reactions can play a major role in verifying the existence of singlet oxygen. Following an in-depth analysis based on Marcus theory, we conclude that 1O2 can only originate from a chemical step. A direct electrochemical generation, as proposed by others, can be excluded on the basis of theoretical arguments.","221":"","222":"The first step in the construction of a regression model or a data-driven analysis, aiming to predict or elucidate the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of matter and its properties, involves transforming the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms into a suitable representation. The development of atomic-scale representations has played, and continues to play, a central role in the success of machine-learning methods for chemistry and materials science. This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field.","223":null,"224":"Directed evolution aims to expedite the natural evolution process of biological molecules and systems in a test tube through iterative rounds of gene diversifications and library screening\/selection. It has become one of the most powerful and widespread tools for engineering improved or novel functions in proteins, metabolic pathways, and even whole genomes. This review describes the commonly used gene diversification strategies, screening\/selection methods, and recently developed continuous evolution strategies for directed evolution. Moreover, we highlight some representative applications of directed evolution in engineering nucleic acids, proteins, pathways, genetic circuits, viruses, and whole cells. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives in directed evolution.","225":"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a crucial constituent of the outer membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria, playing a fundamental role in the protection of bacteria from environmental stress factors, in drug resistance, in pathogenesis, and in symbiosis. During the last decades, LPS has been thoroughly dissected, and massive information on this fascinating biomolecule is now available. In this Review, we will give the reader a third millennium update of the current knowledge of LPS with key information on the inherent peculiar carbohydrate chemistry due to often puzzling sugar residues that are uniquely found on it. Then, we will drive the reader through the complex and multifarious immunological outcomes that any given LPS can raise, which is strictly dependent on its chemical structure. Further, we will argue about issues that still remain unresolved and that would represent the immediate future of LPS research. It is critical to address these points to complete our notions on LPS chemistry, functions, and roles, in turn leading to innovative ways to manipulate the processes involving such a still controversial and intriguing biomolecule.","226":"Research related to the development and application of luminescent nanoparticles (LNPs) for chemical and biological analysis and imaging is flourishing. Novel materials and new applications continue to be reported after two decades of research. This review provides a comprehensive and heuristic overview of this field. It is targeted to both newcomers and experts who are interested in a critical assessment of LNP materials, their properties, strengths and weaknesses, and prospective applications. Numerous LNP materials are cataloged by fundamental descriptions of their chemical identities and physical morphology, quantitative photoluminescence (PL) properties, PL mechanisms, and surface chemistry. These materials include various semiconductor quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, graphene derivatives, carbon dots, nanodiamonds, luminescent metal nanoclusters, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles and downshifting nanoparticles, triplet-triplet annihilation nanoparticles, persistent-luminescence nanoparticles, conjugated polymer nanoparticles and semiconducting polymer dots, multi-nanoparticle assemblies, and doped and labeled nanoparticles, including but not limited to those based on polymers and silica. As an exercise in the critical assessment of LNP properties, these materials are ranked by several application-related functional criteria. Additional sections highlight recent examples of advances in chemical and biological analysis, point-of-care diagnostics, and cellular, tissue, and in vivo imaging and theranostics. These examples are drawn from the recent literature and organized by both LNP material and the particular properties that are leveraged to an advantage. Finally, a perspective on what comes next for the field is offered.","227":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely recognized as one of the most fascinating classes of materials from science and engineering perspectives, benefiting from their high porosity and well-defined and tailored structures and components at the atomic level. Although their intrinsic micropores endow size-selective capability and high surface area, etc., the narrow pores limit their applications toward diffusion-control and large-size species involved processes. In recent years, the construction of hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs), MOF-based hierarchically porous composites, and MOF-based hierarchically porous derivatives has captured widespread interest to extend the applications of conventional MOF-based materials. In this Review, the recent advances in the design, synthesis, and functional applications of MOF-based hierarchically porous materials are summarized. Their structural characters toward various applications, including catalysis, gas storage and separation, air filtration, sewage treatment, sensing and energy storage, have been demonstrated with typical reports. The comparison of HP-MOFs with traditional porous materials (e.g., zeolite, porous silica, carbons, metal oxides, and polymers), subsisting challenges, as well as future directions in this research field, are also indicated.","228":"RNA-based therapeutics have shown great promise in treating a broad spectrum of diseases through various mechanisms including knockdown of pathological genes, expression of therapeutic proteins, and programmed gene editing. Due to the inherent instability and negative-charges of RNA molecules, RNA-based therapeutics can make the most use of delivery systems to overcome biological barriers and to release the RNA payload into the cytosol. Among different types of delivery systems, lipid-based RNA delivery systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have been extensively studied due to their unique properties, such as simple chemical synthesis of lipid components, scalable manufacturing processes of LNPs, and wide packaging capability. LNPs represent the most widely used delivery systems for RNA-based therapeutics, as evidenced by the clinical approvals of three LNP-RNA formulations, patisiran, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273. This review covers recent advances of lipids, lipid derivatives, and lipid-derived macromolecules used in RNA delivery over the past several decades. We focus mainly on their chemical structures, synthetic routes, characterization, formulation methods, and structure-activity relationships. We also briefly describe the current status of representative preclinical studies and clinical trials and highlight future opportunities and challenges.","229":"Transition-metal complexes are attractive targets for the design of catalysts and functional materials. The behavior of the metal-organic bond, while very tunable for achieving target properties, is challenging to predict and necessitates searching a wide and complex space to identify needles in haystacks for target applications. This review will focus on the techniques that make high-throughput search of transition-metal chemical space feasible for the discovery of complexes with desirable properties. The review will cover the development, promise, and limitations of \"traditional\" computational chemistry (i.e., force field, semiempirical, and density functional theory methods) as it pertains to data generation for inorganic molecular discovery. The review will also discuss the opportunities and limitations in leveraging experimental data sources. We will focus on how advances in statistical modeling, artificial intelligence, multiobjective optimization, and automation accelerate discovery of lead compounds and design rules. The overall objective of this review is to showcase how bringing together advances from diverse areas of computational chemistry and computer science have enabled the rapid uncovering of structure-property relationships in transition-metal chemistry. We aim to highlight how unique considerations in motifs of metal-organic bonding (e.g., variable spin and oxidation state, and bonding strength\/nature) set them and their discovery apart from more commonly considered organic molecules. We will also highlight how uncertainty and relative data scarcity in transition-metal chemistry motivate specific developments in machine learning representations, model training, and in computational chemistry. Finally, we will conclude with an outlook of areas of opportunity for the accelerated discovery of transition-metal complexes.","230":"This review considers phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene complexes of gold(I) that are used as (pre)catalysts for a range of reactions in organic synthesis. These are divided according to the structure of the ligand, with the narrative focusing on studies that offer a quantitative comparison between the ligands and readily available or widely used existing systems.","231":"High-level radioactive waste is accumulating at temporary storage locations around the world and will eventually be placed in deep geological repositories. The waste forms and containers will be constructed from glass, crystalline ceramic, and metallic materials, which will eventually come into contact with water, considering that the period of performance required to allow sufficient decay of dangerous radionuclides is on the order of 105-106 years. Corrosion of the containers and waste forms in the aqueous repository environment is therefore a concern. This Review describes the recent advances of the field of materials corrosion that are relevant to fundamental materials science issues associated with the long-term performance assessment and the design of materials with improved performance, where performance is defined as resistance to aqueous corrosion. Glass, crystalline ceramics, and metals are discussed separately, and the near-field interactions of these different material classes are also briefly addressed. Finally, recommendations for future directions of study are provided.","232":"There is an obvious gap between efforts dedicated to the control of chemicophysical and morphological properties of catalyst active phases and the attention paid to the search of new materials to be employed as functional carriers in the upgrading of heterogeneous catalysts. Economic constraints and common habits in preparing heterogeneous catalysts have narrowed the selection of active-phase carriers to a handful of materials: oxide-based ceramics (e.g. Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and aluminosilicates-zeolites) and carbon. However, these carriers occasionally face chemicophysical constraints that limit their application in catalysis. For instance, oxides are easily corroded by acids or bases, and carbon is not resistant to oxidation. Therefore, these carriers cannot be recycled. Moreover, the poor thermal conductivity of metal oxide carriers often translates into permanent alterations of the catalyst active sites (i.e. metal active-phase sintering) that compromise the catalyst performance and its lifetime on run. Therefore, the development of new carriers for the design and synthesis of advanced functional catalytic materials and processes is an urgent priority for the heterogeneous catalysis of the future. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a non-oxide semiconductor with unique chemicophysical properties that make it highly attractive in several branches of catalysis. Accordingly, the past decade has witnessed a large increase of reports dedicated to the design of SiC-based catalysts, also in light of a steadily growing portfolio of porous SiC materials covering a wide range of well-controlled pore structure and surface properties. This review article provides a comprehensive overview on the synthesis and use of macro\/mesoporous SiC materials in catalysis, stressing their unique features for the design of efficient, cost-effective, and easy to scale-up heterogeneous catalysts, outlining their success where other and more classical oxide-based supports failed. All applications of SiC in catalysis will be reviewed from the perspective of a given chemical reaction, highlighting all improvements rising from the use of SiC in terms of activity, selectivity, and process sustainability. We feel that the experienced viewpoint of SiC-based catalyst producers and end users (these authors) and their critical presentation of a comprehensive overview on the applications of SiC in catalysis will help the readership to create its own opinion on the central role of SiC for the future of heterogeneous catalysis.","233":"Nucleic acids, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), are natural biopolymers composed of nucleotides that store, transmit, and express genetic information. Overexpressed or underexpressed as well as mutated nucleic acids have been implicated in many diseases. Therefore, nucleic acid tests (NATs) are extremely important. Inspired by intracellular DNA replication and RNA transcription, in vitro NATs have been extensively developed to improve the detection specificity, sensitivity, and simplicity. The principles of NATs can be in general classified into three categories: nucleic acid hybridization, thermal-cycle or isothermal amplification, and signal amplification. Driven by pressing needs in clinical diagnosis and prevention of infectious diseases, NATs have evolved to be a rapidly advancing field. During the past ten years, an explosive increase of research interest in both basic research and clinical translation has been witnessed. In this review, we aim to provide comprehensive coverage of the progress to analyze nucleic acids, use nucleic acids as recognition probes, construct detection devices based on nucleic acids, and utilize nucleic acids in clinical diagnosis and other important fields. We also discuss the new frontiers in the field and the challenges to be addressed.","234":"Oriented semiconductor nanostructures and thin films exhibit many advantageous properties, such as directional exciton transport, efficient charge transfer and separation, and optical anisotropy, and hence these nanostructures are highly promising for use in optoelectronics and photonics. The controlled growth of these structures can facilitate device integration to improve optoelectronic performance and benefit in-depth fundamental studies of the physical properties of these materials. Halide perovskites have emerged as a new family of promising and cost-effective semiconductor materials for next-generation high-power conversion efficiency photovoltaics and for versatile high-performance optoelectronics, such as light-emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors, and high-energy radiation imaging and detectors. In this Review, we summarize the advances in the fabrication of halide perovskite nanostructures and thin films with controlled dimensionality and crystallographic orientation, along with their applications and performance characteristics in optoelectronics. We examine the growth methods, mechanisms, and fabrication strategies for several technologically relevant structures, including nanowires, nanoplates, nanostructure arrays, single-crystal thin films, and highly oriented thin films. We highlight and discuss the advantageous photophysical properties and remarkable performance characteristics of oriented nanostructures and thin films for optoelectronics. Finally, we survey the remaining challenges and provide a perspective regarding the opportunities for further progress in this field.","235":"Biological systems have evolved to utilize proteins to accomplish nearly all functional roles needed to sustain life. A majority of biological functions occur within the crowded environment inside cells and subcellular compartments where proteins exist in a densely packed complex network of protein-protein interactions. The structural biology field has experienced a renaissance with recent advances in crystallography, NMR, and CryoEM that now produce stunning models of large and complex structures previously unimaginable. Nevertheless, measurements of such structural detail within cellular environments remain elusive. This review will highlight how advances in mass spectrometry, chemical labeling, and informatics capabilities are merging to provide structural insights on proteins, complexes, and networks that exist inside cells. Because of the molecular detection specificity provided by mass spectrometry and proteomics, these approaches provide systems-level information that not only benefits from conventional structural analysis, but also is highly complementary. Although far from comprehensive in their current form, these approaches are currently providing systems structural biology information that can uniquely reveal how conformations and interactions involving many proteins change inside cells with perturbations such as disease, drug treatment, or phenotypic differences. With continued advancements and more widespread adaptation, systems structural biology based on in-cell labeling and mass spectrometry will provide an even greater wealth of structural knowledge.","236":"Machine learning models are poised to make a transformative impact on chemical sciences by dramatically accelerating computational algorithms and amplifying insights available from computational chemistry methods. However, achieving this requires a confluence and coaction of expertise in computer science and physical sciences. This Review is written for new and experienced researchers working at the intersection of both fields. We first provide concise tutorials of computational chemistry and machine learning methods, showing how insights involving both can be achieved. We follow with a critical review of noteworthy applications that demonstrate how computational chemistry and machine learning can be used together to provide insightful (and useful) predictions in molecular and materials modeling, retrosyntheses, catalysis, and drug design.","237":"Recent progress in the development of photocatalytic reactions promoted by visible light is leading to a renaissance in the use of photochemistry in the construction of structurally elaborate organic molecules. Because of the rich functionality found in natural products, studies in natural product total synthesis provide useful insights into functional group compatibility of these new photocatalytic methods as well as their impact on synthetic strategy. In this review, we examine total syntheses published through the end of 2020 that employ a visible-light photoredox catalytic step. To assist someone interested in employing the photocatalytic steps discussed, the review is organized largely by the nature of the bond formed in the photocatalytic step.","238":"The critical aspects of the corrosion of metal electrodes in cathodic reductions are covered. We discuss the involved mechanisms including alloying with alkali metals, cathodic etching in aqueous and aprotic media, and formation of metal hydrides and organometallics. Successful approaches that have been implemented to suppress cathodic corrosion are reviewed. We present several examples from electroorganic synthesis where the clever use of alloys instead of soft neat heavy metals and the application of protective cationic additives have allowed to successfully exploit these materials as cathodes. Because of the high overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction, such cathodes can contribute toward more sustainable green synthetic processes. The reported strategies expand the applications of organic electrosynthesis because a more negative regime is accessible within protic media and common metal poisons, e.g., sulfur-containing substrates, are compatible with these cathodes. The strongly diminished hydrogen evolution side reaction paves the way for more efficient reductive electroorganic conversions.","239":"Global energy and environmental crises are among the most pressing challenges facing humankind. To overcome these challenges, recent years have seen an upsurge of interest in the development and production of renewable chemical fuels as alternatives to the nonrenewable and high-polluting fossil fuels. Photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and electrocatalysis provide promising avenues for sustainable energy conversion. Single- and dual-component catalytic systems based on nanomaterials have been intensively studied for decades, but their intrinsic weaknesses hamper their practical applications. Multicomponent nanomaterial-based systems, consisting of three or more components with at least one component in the nanoscale, have recently emerged. The multiple components are integrated together to create synergistic effects and hence overcome the limitation for outperformance. Such higher-efficiency systems based on nanomaterials will potentially bring an additional benefit in balance-of-system costs if they exclude the use of noble metals, considering the expense and sustainability. It is therefore timely to review the research in this field, providing guidance in the development of noble-metal-free multicomponent nanointegration for sustainable energy conversion. In this work, we first recall the fundamentals of catalysis by nanomaterials, multicomponent nanointegration, and reactor configuration for water splitting, CO2 reduction, and N2 reduction. We then systematically review and discuss recent advances in multicomponent-based photocatalytic, photoelectrochemical, and electrochemical systems based on nanomaterials. On the basis of these systems, we further laterally evaluate different multicomponent integration strategies and highlight their impacts on catalytic activity, performance stability, and product selectivity. Finally, we provide conclusions and future prospects for multicomponent nanointegration. This work offers comprehensive insights into the development of cost-competitive multicomponent nanomaterial-based systems for sustainable energy-conversion technologies and assists researchers working toward addressing the global challenges in energy and the environment.","240":"Since the industrial revolution, the rapid growth and development of global industries have depended largely upon the utilization of coal-derived chemicals, and more recently, the utilization of petroleum-based chemicals. These developments have followed a linear economy model (produce, consume, and dispose). As the world is facing a serious threat from the climate change crisis, a more sustainable solution for manufacturing, i.e., circular economy in which waste from the same or different industries can be used as feedstocks or resources for production offers an attractive industrial\/business model. In nature, biological systems, i.e., microorganisms routinely use their enzymes and metabolic pathways to convert organic and inorganic wastes to synthesize biochemicals and energy required for their growth. Therefore, an understanding of how selected enzymes convert biobased feedstocks into special (bio)chemicals serves as an important basis from which to build on for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology to enable biobased processes that are greener and cleaner for the environment. This review article highlights the current state of knowledge regarding the enzymatic reactions used in converting biobased wastes (lignocellulosic biomass, sugar, phenolic acid, triglyceride, fatty acid, and glycerol) and greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) into value-added products and discusses the current progress made in their metabolic engineering. The commercial aspects and life cycle assessment of products from enzymatic and metabolic engineering are also discussed. Continued development in the field of metabolic engineering would offer diversified solutions which are sustainable and renewable for manufacturing valuable chemicals.","241":"For molecules with a singlet ground state, the population of triplet states is mainly possible (a) by direct excitation and subsequent intersystem crossing or (b) by energy transfer from an appropriate sensitizer. The latter scenario enables a catalytic photochemical reaction in which the sensitizer adopts the role of a catalyst undergoing several cycles of photon absorption and subsequent energy transfer to the substrate. If the product molecule of a triplet-sensitized process is chiral, this process can proceed enantioselectively upon judicious choice of a chiral triplet sensitizer. An enantioselective reaction can also occur in a dual catalytic approach in which, apart from an achiral sensitizer, a second chiral catalyst activates the substrate toward sensitization. Although the idea of enantioselective photochemical reactions via triplet intermediates has been pursued for more than 50 years, notable selectivities exceeding 90% enantiomeric excess (ee) have only been realized in the past decade. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive survey on the various photochemical reactions which were rendered enantioselective by triplet sensitization.","242":"Many existing clinical treatments are limited in their ability to completely restore decreased or lost tissue and organ function, an unenviable situation only further exacerbated by a globally aging population. As a result, the demand for new medical interventions has increased substantially over the past 20 years, with the burgeoning fields of gene therapy, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine showing promise to offer solutions for full repair or replacement of damaged or aging tissues. Success in these fields, however, inherently relies on biomaterials that are engendered with the ability to provide the necessary biological cues mimicking native extracellular matrixes that support cell fate. Accelerating the development of such \"directive\" biomaterials requires a shift in current design practices toward those that enable rapid synthesis and characterization of polymeric materials and the coupling of these processes with techniques that enable similarly rapid quantification and optimization of the interactions between these new material systems and target cells and tissues. This manuscript reviews recent advances in combinatorial and high-throughput (HT) technologies applied to polymeric biomaterial synthesis, fabrication, and chemical, physical, and biological screening with targeted end-point applications in the fields of gene therapy, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Limitations of, and future opportunities for, the further application of these research tools and methodologies are also discussed.","243":"The structure, chemistry, and charge of interfaces between materials and aqueous fluids play a central role in determining properties and performance of numerous water systems. Sensors, membranes, sorbents, and heterogeneous catalysts almost uniformly rely on specific interactions between their surfaces and components dissolved or suspended in the water-and often the water molecules themselves-to detect and mitigate contaminants. Deleterious processes in these systems such as fouling, scaling (inorganic deposits), and corrosion are also governed by interfacial phenomena. Despite the importance of these interfaces, much remains to be learned about their multiscale interactions. Developing a deeper understanding of the molecular- and mesoscale phenomena at water\/solid interfaces will be essential to driving innovation to address grand challenges in supplying sufficient fit-for-purpose water in the future. In this Review, we examine the current state of knowledge surrounding adsorption, reactivity, and transport in several key classes of water\/solid interfaces, drawing on a synergistic combination of theory, simulation, and experiments, and provide an outlook for prioritizing strategic research directions.","244":"Terminal and benign diseases alike in adults, children, pregnant women, and others are successfully treated by pharmacological inhibitors that target human enzymes. Despite extensive global efforts to fight malaria, the disease continues to be a massive worldwide health burden, and new interventional strategies are needed. Current drugs and vector control strategies have contributed to the reduction in malaria deaths over the past 10 years, but progress toward eradication has waned in recent years. Resistance to antimalarial drugs is a substantial and growing problem. Moreover, targeting dormant forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is only possible with two approved drugs, which are both contraindicated for individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and in pregnant women. Plasmodium parasites are obligate intracellular parasites and thus have specific and absolute requirements of their hosts. Growing evidence has described these host necessities, paving the way for opportunities to pharmacologically target host factors to eliminate Plasmodium infection. Here, we describe progress in malaria research and adjacent fields and discuss key challenges that remain in implementing host-directed therapy against malaria.","245":"In eons of evolution, isocyanides carved out a niche in the ecological systems probably thanks to their metal coordinating properties. In 1859 the first isocyanide was synthesized by humans and in 1950 the first natural isocyanide was discovered. Now, at the beginning of XXI century, hundreds of isocyanides have been isolated both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and thousands have been synthesized in the laboratory. For some of them their ecological role is known, and their potent biological activity as antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, antifouling, and antitumoral compounds has been described. Notwithstanding, the isocyanides have not gained a good reputation among medicinal chemists who have erroneously considered them either too reactive or metabolically unstable, and this has restricted their main use to technical applications as ligands in coordination chemistry. The aim of this review is therefore to show the richness in biological activity of the isocyanide-containing molecules, to support the idea of using the isocyanide functional group as an unconventional pharmacophore especially useful as a metal coordinating warhead. The unhidden hope is to convince the skeptical medicinal chemists of the isocyanide potential in many areas of drug discovery and considering them in the design of future drugs.","246":"The pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), causing tuberculosis disease, features an extraordinary thick cell envelope, rich in Mtb-specific lipids, glycolipids, and glycans. These cell wall components are often directly involved in host-pathogen interaction and recognition, intracellular survival, and virulence. For decades, these mycobacterial natural products have been of great interest for immunology and synthetic chemistry alike, due to their complex molecular structure and the biological functions arising from it. The synthesis of many of these constituents has been achieved and aided the elucidation of their function by utilizing the synthetic material to study Mtb immunology. This review summarizes the synthetic efforts of a quarter century of total synthesis and highlights how the synthesis layed the foundation for immunological studies as well as drove the field of organic synthesis and catalysis to efficiently access these complex natural products.","247":"Owing to their unique chemical and physical properties, hydrogels are attracting increasing attention in both basic and translational biomedical studies. Although the classical hydrogels with static networks have been widely reported for decades, a growing number of recent studies have shown that structurally dynamic hydrogels can better mimic the dynamics and functions of natural extracellular matrix (ECM) in soft tissues. These synthetic materials with defined compositions can recapitulate key chemical and biophysical properties of living tissues, providing an important means to understanding the mechanisms by which cells sense and remodel their surrounding microenvironments. This review begins with the overall expectation and design principles of dynamic hydrogels. We then highlight recent progress in the fabrication strategies of dynamic hydrogels including both degradation-dependent and degradation-independent approaches, followed by their unique properties and use in biomedical applications such as regenerative medicine, drug delivery, and 3D culture. Finally, challenges and emerging trends in the development and application of dynamic hydrogels are discussed.","248":"In the final steps of energy conservation in aerobic organisms, free energy from electron transfer through the respiratory chain is transduced into a proton electrochemical gradient across a membrane. In mitochondria and many bacteria, reduction of the dioxygen electron acceptor is catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), which receives electrons from cytochrome bc1 (complex III), via membrane-bound or water-soluble cytochrome c. These complexes function independently, but in many organisms they associate to form supercomplexes. Here, we review the structural features and the functional significance of the nonobligate III2IV1\/2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial supercomplex as well as the obligate III2IV2 supercomplex from actinobacteria. The analysis is centered around the Q-cycle of complex III, proton uptake by CytcO, as well as mechanistic and structural solutions to the electronic link between complexes III and IV.","249":"Copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between organic azides and terminal alkynes, commonly known as CuAAC or click chemistry, has been identified as one of the most successful, versatile, reliable, and modular strategies for the rapid and regioselective construction of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles as diversely functionalized molecules. Carbohydrates, an integral part of living cells, have several fascinating features, including their structural diversity, biocompatibility, bioavailability, hydrophilicity, and superior ADME properties with minimal toxicity, which support increased demand to explore them as versatile scaffolds for easy access to diverse glycohybrids and well-defined glycoconjugates for complete chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological investigations. This review highlights the successful development of CuAAC or click chemistry in emerging areas of glycoscience, including the synthesis of triazole appended carbohydrate-containing molecular architectures (mainly glycohybrids, glycoconjugates, glycopolymers, glycopeptides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycoclusters, and glycodendrimers through regioselective triazole forming modular and bio-orthogonal coupling protocols). It discusses the widespread applications of these glycoproducts as enzyme inhibitors in drug discovery and development, sensing, gelation, chelation, glycosylation, and catalysis. This review also covers the impact of click chemistry and provides future perspectives on its role in various emerging disciplines of science and technology.","250":"The continuously decreasing size of device features in microelectronics draws growing attention to the structuring of silicon at the molecular level with powerful tools provided by synthetic chemistry. Silicon clusters are of particular importance in this regard not only as potential precursors for silicon deposition but also as well-defined model systems for bulk and surfaces of silicon at the nanoscale as well as possible starting points for future construction of molecularly precise device structures. This review aims to give a comprehensive overview about the state of the art in the synthesis of molecular silicon clusters, which are grouped into (1) electron-precise saturated clusters, (2) soluble polyhedral Zintl anions, and (3) unsaturated silicon clusters, the so-called siliconoids. Particular attention is paid to functionalization as it is generally considered a necessary prerequisite for the design and construction of more extended systems. The interrelations between the three different classes of molecular silicon clusters, e.g., arising from the introduction of negatively charged functional groups, are highlighted on grounds of NMR properties and computed electronic structures.","251":"Interfaces between a liquid and a solid (L-S) are the most important surface science in chemistry, catalysis, energy, and even biology. Formation of an electric double layer (EDL) at the L-S interface has been attributed due to the adsorption of a layer of ions at the solid surface, which causes the ions in the liquid to redistribute. Although the existence of a layer of charges on a solid surface is always assumed, the origin of the charges is not extensively explored. Recent studies of contact electrification (CE) between a liquid and a solid suggest that electron transfer plays a dominant role at the initial stage for forming the charge layer at the L-S interface. Here, we review the recent works about electron transfer in liquid-solid CE, including scenerios such as liquid-insulator, liquid-semiconductor, and liquid-metal. Formation of the EDL is revisited considering the existence of electron transfer at the L-S interface. Furthermore, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technique based on the liquid-solid CE is introduced, which can be used not only for harvesting mechanical energy from a liquid but also as a probe for probing the charge transfer at liquid-solid interfaces.","252":"","253":"Researchers have worked for many decades to master the rules of biomolecular design that would allow artificial biopolymer complexes to self-assemble and function similarly to the diverse biochemical constructs displayed in natural biological systems. The rules of nucleic acid assembly (dominated by Watson-Crick base-pairing) have been less difficult to understand and manipulate than the more complicated rules of protein folding. Therefore, nucleic acid nanotechnology has advanced more quickly than de novo protein design, and recent years have seen amazing progress in DNA and RNA design. By combining structural motifs with aptamers that act as affinity handles and add powerful molecular recognition capabilities, nucleic acid-based self-assemblies represent a diverse toolbox for use by bioengineers to create molecules with potentially revolutionary biological activities. In this review, we focus on the development of self-assembling nucleic acid nanostructures that are functionalized with nucleic acid aptamers and their great potential in wide ranging application areas.","254":"Nonadiabatic effects are ubiquitous in photophysics and photochemistry, and therefore, many theoretical developments have been made to properly describe them. Conical intersections are central in nonadiabatic processes, as they promote efficient and ultrafast nonadiabatic transitions between electronic states. A proper theoretical description requires developments in electronic structure and specifically in methods that describe conical intersections between states and nonadiabatic coupling terms. This review focuses on the electronic structure aspects of nonadiabatic processes. We discuss the requirements of electronic structure methods to describe conical intersections and nonadiabatic couplings, how the most common excited state methods perform in describing these effects, and what the recent developments are in expanding the methodology and implementing nonadiabatic couplings.","255":"Fatty acids are crucial molecules for most living beings, very well spread and conserved across species. These molecules play a role in energy storage, cell membrane architecture, and cell signaling, the latter through their derivative metabolites. De novo synthesis of fatty acids is a complex chemical process that can be achieved either by a metabolic pathway built by a sequence of individual enzymes, such as in most bacteria, or by a single, large multi-enzyme, which incorporates all the chemical capabilities of the metabolic pathway, such as in animals and fungi, and in some bacteria. Here we focus on the multi-enzymes, specifically in the animal fatty acid synthase (FAS). We start by providing a historical overview of this vast field of research. We follow by describing the extraordinary architecture of animal FAS, a homodimeric multi-enzyme with seven different active sites per dimer, including a carrier protein that carries the intermediates from one active site to the next. We then delve into this multi-enzyme's detailed chemistry and critically discuss the current knowledge on the chemical mechanism of each of the steps necessary to synthesize a single fatty acid molecule with atomic detail. In line with this, we discuss the potential and achieved FAS applications in biotechnology, as biosynthetic machines, and compare them with their homologous polyketide synthases, which are also finding wide applications in the same field. Finally, we discuss some open questions on the architecture of FAS, such as their peculiar substrate-shuttling arm, and describe possible reasons for the emergence of large megasynthases during evolution, questions that have fascinated biochemists from long ago but are still far from answered and understood.","256":"Iron (Fe) is the fourth most abundant element in the earth's crust and plays important roles in both biological and chemical processes. The redox reactivity of various Fe(II) forms has gained increasing attention over recent decades in the areas of (bio) geochemistry, environmental chemistry and engineering, and material sciences. The goal of this paper is to review these recent advances and the current state of knowledge of Fe(II) redox chemistry in the environment. Specifically, this comprehensive review focuses on the redox reactivity of four types of Fe(II) species including aqueous Fe(II), Fe(II) complexed with ligands, minerals bearing structural Fe(II), and sorbed Fe(II) on mineral oxide surfaces. The formation pathways, factors governing the reactivity, insights into potential mechanisms, reactivity comparison, and characterization techniques are discussed with reference to the most recent breakthroughs in this field where possible. We also cover the roles of these Fe(II) species in environmental applications of zerovalent iron, microbial processes, biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients, and their abiotic oxidation related processes in natural and engineered systems.","257":"The advancement of high-efficiency luminescent and thermally stable organometallic complexes has offered opportunities for the commercialization of metal phosphors for fabricating organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Since the first report on the potential use of iridium(III) and platinum(II) complexes for applications in OLEDs in the late 1990s, extensive efforts have been made by researchers on the development of various heavy metal-containing compounds with rich photophysical and luminescence properties and the engineering of device architectures to improve device efficiencies. Apart from the more well-studied iridium(III) and platinum(II) complexes, complexes of gold(III) recently have demonstrated their capabilities to serve as phosphorescent or thermally stimulated delayed phosphorescent or thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters, and their promising performances in OLEDs have attracted growing interest in the past decade. Nowadays, complexes of gold(III) with emission energies ranging from sky-blue to near-infrared with high electroluminescence performances have been obtained. In addition, high-efficiency vacuum-deposited and solution-processed OLEDs with benchmark efficiencies comparable to those of the iridium(III) and platinum(II) complexes have been realized. This Focus Review summarizes the development of various series of luminescent gold(III) complexes to date and highlights important milestones in the development and advancement of gold(III)-based OLEDs. Focus will be made on the molecular design strategies for gold(III) emitters for application as dopants in OLEDs, including those fabricated by vacuum-deposition and solution-processing techniques.","258":null,"259":"Inspired by the high photoconversion efficiency observed in natural light-harvesting systems, the hierarchical organization of molecular building blocks has gained impetus in the past few decades. Particularly, the molecular arrangement and packing in the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to the decisive role of the nature of donor\/acceptor (D\/A) heterojunctions in charge carrier generation and ultimately the power conversion efficiency. This review focuses on the recent developments in emergent optoelectronic properties exhibited by self-sorted donor-on-donor\/acceptor-on-acceptor arrangement of covalently linked D-A systems, highlighting the ultrafast excited state dynamics of charge transfer and transport. Segregated organization of donors and acceptors promotes the delocalization of photoinduced charges among the stacks, engendering an enhanced charge separation lifetime and percolation pathways with ambipolar conductivity and charge carrier yield. Covalently linking donors and acceptors ensure a sufficient D-A interface and interchromophoric electronic coupling as required for faster charge separation while providing better control over their supramolecular assemblies. The design strategies to attain D-A conjugate assemblies with optimal charge carrier generation efficiency, the scope of their application compared to state-of-the-art OSCs, current challenges, and future opportunities are discussed in the review. An integrated overview of rational design approaches derived from the comprehension of underlying photoinduced processes can pave the way toward superior optoelectronic devices and bring in new possibilities to the avenue of functional supramolecular architectures.","260":null,"261":null,"262":null,"263":"Nature achieves differentiation of specific and nonspecific binding in molecular interactions through precise control of biomolecules in space and time. Artificial systems such as biosensors that rely on distinguishing specific molecular binding events in a sea of nonspecific interactions have struggled to overcome this issue. Despite the numerous technological advancements in biosensor technologies, nonspecific binding has remained a critical bottleneck due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon. To date, the identity, cause, and influence of nonspecific binding remain topics of debate within the scientific community. In this review, we discuss the evolution of the concept of nonspecific binding over the past five decades based upon the thermodynamic, intermolecular, and structural perspectives to provide classification frameworks for biomolecular interactions. Further, we introduce various theoretical models that predict the expected behavior of biosensors in physiologically relevant environments to calculate the theoretical detection limit and to optimize sensor performance. We conclude by discussing existing practical approaches to tackle the nonspecific binding challenge in vitro for biosensing platforms and how we can both address and harness nonspecific interactions for in vivo systems.","264":"Bioorthogonal phosphines were introduced in the context of the Staudinger ligation over 20 years ago. Since that time, phosphine probes have been used in myriad applications to tag azide-functionalized biomolecules. The Staudinger ligation also paved the way for the development of other phosphorus-based chemistries, many of which are widely employed in biological experiments. Several reviews have highlighted early achievements in the design and application of bioorthogonal phosphines. This review summarizes more recent advances in the field. We discuss innovations in classic Staudinger-like transformations that have enabled new biological pursuits. We also highlight relative newcomers to the bioorthogonal stage, including the cyclopropenone-phosphine ligation and the phospha-Michael reaction. The review concludes with chemoselective reactions involving phosphite and phosphonite ligations. For each transformation, we describe the overall mechanism and scope. We also showcase efforts to fine-tune the reagents for specific functions. We further describe recent applications of the chemistries in biological settings. Collectively, these examples underscore the versatility and breadth of bioorthogonal phosphine reagents.","265":"Machine learning (ML) techniques applied to chemical reactions have a long history. The present contribution discusses applications ranging from small molecule reaction dynamics to computational platforms for reaction planning. ML-based techniques can be particularly relevant for problems involving both computation and experiments. For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to develop models consistent with knowledge from experiments. Second, ML-based methods can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state information in reactive collisions. Finally, the explicit simulation of reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning techniques, and an outlook discusses challenges in this diverse and stimulating field. It is concluded that ML applied to chemistry problems as practiced and conceived today has the potential to transform the way with which the field approaches problems involving chemical reactions, in both research and academic teaching.","266":null,"267":"Catalysis is essential to modern life and has a huge economic impact. The development of new catalysts critically depends on synthetic methods that enable the preparation of tailored nanomaterials. Pulsed laser in liquids synthesis can produce uniform, multicomponent, nonequilibrium nanomaterials with independently and precisely controlled properties, such as size, composition, morphology, defect density, and atomistic structure within the nanoparticle and at its surface. We cover the fundamentals, unique advantages, challenges, and experimental solutions of this powerful technique and review the state-of-the-art of laser-made electrocatalysts for water oxidation, oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, nitrogen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and organic oxidations, followed by laser-made nanomaterials for light-driven catalytic processes and heterogeneous catalysis of thermochemical processes. We also highlight laser-synthesized nanomaterials for which proposed catalytic applications exist. This review provides a practical guide to how the catalysis community can capitalize on pulsed laser in liquids synthesis to advance catalyst development, by leveraging the synergies of two fields of intensive research.","268":"The successful exfoliation of graphene has given a tremendous boost to research on various two-dimensional (2D) materials in the last 15 years. Different from traditional thin films, a 2D material is composed of one to a few atomic layers. While atoms within a layer are chemically bonded, interactions between layers are generally weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Due to their particular dimensionality, 2D materials exhibit special electronic, magnetic, mechanical, and thermal properties, not found in their 3D counterparts, and therefore they have great potential in various applications, such as 2D materials-based devices. To fully realize their large-scale practical applications, especially in devices, wafer scale single crystalline (WSSC) 2D materials are indispensable. In this review, we present a detailed overview on strategies toward the synthesis of WSSC 2D materials while highlighting the recent progress on WSSC graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) synthesis. The challenges that need to be addressed in future studies have also been described. In general, there have been two distinct routes to synthesize WSSC 2D materials: (i) allowing only one nucleus on a wafer scale substrate to be formed and developed into a large single crystal and (ii) seamlessly stitching a large number of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands on a wafer scale substrate, which is generally single crystalline. Currently, the synthesis of WSSC graphene has been realized by both routes, and WSSC hBN and MoS2 have been synthesized by route (ii). On the other hand, the growth of other WSSC 2D materials and WSSC multilayer 2D materials still remains a big challenge. In the last section, we wrap up this review by summarizing the future challenges and opportunities in the synthesis of various WSSC 2D materials.","269":"RNA nanotechnology is the bottom-up self-assembly of nanometer-scale architectures, resembling LEGOs, composed mainly of RNA. The ideal building material should be (1) versatile and controllable in shape and stoichiometry, (2) spontaneously self-assemble, and (3) thermodynamically, chemically, and enzymatically stable with a long shelf life. RNA building blocks exhibit each of the above. RNA is a polynucleic acid, making it a polymer, and its negative-charge prevents nonspecific binding to negatively charged cell membranes. The thermostability makes it suitable for logic gates, resistive memory, sensor set-ups, and NEM devices. RNA can be designed and manipulated with a level of simplicity of DNA while displaying versatile structure and enzyme activity of proteins. RNA can fold into single-stranded loops or bulges to serve as mounting dovetails for intermolecular or domain interactions without external linking dowels. RNA nanoparticles display rubber- and amoeba-like properties and are stretchable and shrinkable through multiple repeats, leading to enhanced tumor targeting and fast renal excretion to reduce toxicities. It was predicted in 2014 that RNA would be the third milestone in pharmaceutical drug development. The recent approval of several RNA drugs and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by FDA suggests that this milestone is being realized. Here, we review the unique properties of RNA nanotechnology, summarize its recent advancements, describe its distinct attributes inside or outside the body and discuss potential applications in nanotechnology, medicine, and material science.","270":"Syngas chemistry has been under study since Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was invented in the 1920s. Despite the successful applications of FTS as the core technology of coal-to-liquid and gas-to-liquid processes in industry, the product selectivity control of syngas conversion still remains a great challenge, particularly for value-added chemicals such as light olefins. Recent studies show that the catalyst design concept of OXZEO (oxide-zeolite-based composite) enables direct syngas conversion to mixed light olefins with a selectivity reaching 80% and to ethylene with a selectivity of 83% among hydrocarbons. They both well-surpass the limits predicated by the Anderson-Schultz-Flory model via the conventional FTS route (58% and 30%, respectively). Furthermore, this catalyst concept allows one-step synthesis of gasoline-range isoparaffins and aromatic compounds, which is otherwise not possible in conventional FTS. A rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate the versatility of this concept and may form a technology platform for utilization of carbon resources including coal, natural gas, and biomass via syngas to a variety of basic chemicals and fuels. However, the selectivity control mechanism is far from being understood. Therefore, we focus mainly on the catalytic roles of the bifunctionalities of OXZEO while reviewing the development of bifunctional catalysts for selective syngas conversion by taking syngas-to-light olefins as an example. With this, we intend to provide insights into the selectivity control mechanism of the OXZEO concept in order to understand the challenges and prospects for future development of much more active and more selective catalysts.","271":null,"272":"Drug development is a long process whose main content includes drug synthesis, drug delivery, and drug evaluation. Compared with conventional drug development procedures, microfluidics has emerged as a revolutionary technology in that it offers a miniaturized and highly controllable environment for bio(chemical) reactions to take place. It is also compatible with analytical strategies to implement integrated and high-throughput screening and evaluations. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the entire microfluidics-based drug development system, from drug synthesis to drug evaluation. The challenges in the current status and the prospects for future development are also discussed. We believe that this review will promote communications throughout diversified scientific and engineering communities that will continue contributing to this burgeoning field.","273":"Elemental imaging gives insight into the fundamental chemical makeup of living organisms. Every cell on Earth is comprised of a complex and dynamic mixture of the chemical elements that define structure and function. Many disease states feature a disturbance in elemental homeostasis, and understanding how, and most importantly where, has driven the development of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) as the principal elemental imaging technique for biologists. This review provides an outline of ICP-MS technology, laser ablation cell designs, imaging workflows, and methods of quantification. Detailed examples of imaging applications including analyses of cancers, elemental uptake and accumulation, plant bioimaging, nanomaterials in the environment, and exposure science and neuroscience are presented and discussed. Recent incorporation of immunohistochemical workflows for imaging biomolecules, complementary and multimodal imaging techniques, and image processing methods is also reviewed.","274":"The chiral oxazoline motif is present in many ligands that have been extensively applied in a series of important metal-catalyzed enantioselective reactions. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most significant applications of oxazoline-containing ligands reported in the literature starting from 2009 until the end of 2018. The ligands are classified not by the reaction to which their metal complexes have been applied but by the nature of the denticity, chirality, and donor atoms involved. As a result, the continued development of ligand architectural design from mono(oxazolines), to bis(oxazolines), to tris(oxazolines) and tetra(oxazolines) and variations thereof can be more easily monitored by the reader. In addition, the key transition states of selected asymmetric transformations will be given to illustrate the features that give rise to high levels of asymmetric induction. As a further aid to the reader, we summarize the majority of schemes with representative examples that highlight the variation in % yields and % ees for carefully selected substrates. This Review should be of particular interest to the experts in the field but also serve as a useful starting point to new researchers in this area. It is hoped that this Review will stimulate both the development\/design of new ligands and their applications in novel metal-catalyzed asymmetric transformations.","275":"Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of double bonds has been one of the most effective methods for the preparation of chiral molecules and for the synthesis of important chiral building blocks. In the past 60 years, noble metals with bidentate ligands have shown marvelous reactivity and enantioselectivity in asymmetric hydrogenation of a series of prochiral substrates. In recent years, developing chiral tridentate ligands has played an increasingly important role in AH. With modular frameworks and a variety of functionalities on the side arms, chiral tridentate ligand complexes enable both reactivities and stereoselectivities. Although great achievements have been made for noble metal catalysts with chiral tridentate ligands since the 1990s, the design of chiral tridentate ligands for earth abundant metal catalysts has still been in high demand. This review summarizes the development of chiral tridentate ligands for homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation. The philosophy of ligand design and the reaction mechanisms are highlighted and discussed as well.","276":"In this Focus Review, we put the spotlight on very recent insights into the fascinating world of wet chemistry in the realm offered by nanoconfinement of water in mechanically rather rigid and chemically inert planar slit pores wherein only monolayer and bilayer water lamellae can be hosted. We review the effect of confinement on different aspects such as hydrogen bonding, ion diffusion, and charge defect migration of H+(aq) and OH-(aq) in nanoconfined water depending on slit pore width. A particular focus is put on the strongly modulated local dielectric properties as quantified in terms of anisotropic polarization fluctuations across such extremely confined water films and their putative effects on chemical reactions therein. The stunning findings disclosed only recently extend wet chemistry in particular and solvation science in general toward extreme molecular confinement conditions.","277":"A primary goal of metabolomics studies is to fully characterize the small-molecule composition of complex biological and environmental samples. However, despite advances in analytical technologies over the past two decades, the majority of small molecules in complex samples are not readily identifiable due to the immense structural and chemical diversity present within the metabolome. Current gold-standard identification methods rely on reference libraries built using authentic chemical materials (\"standards\"), which are not available for most molecules. Computational quantum chemistry methods, which can be used to calculate chemical properties that are then measured by analytical platforms, offer an alternative route for building reference libraries, i.e., in silico libraries for \"standards-free\" identification. In this review, we cover the major roadblocks currently facing metabolomics and discuss applications where quantum chemistry calculations offer a solution. Several successful examples for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ion mobility spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry methods are reviewed. Finally, we consider current best practices, sources of error, and provide an outlook for quantum chemistry calculations in metabolomics studies. We expect this review will inspire researchers in the field of small-molecule identification to accelerate adoption of in silico methods for generation of reference libraries and to add quantum chemistry calculations as another tool at their disposal to characterize complex samples.","278":"All living cells are surrounded by lipidic membranes that separate metabolic and macromolecular biosynthetic processes from external environments. Biological membranes vary dramatically in their composition and structures and are optimized by mega-annum of evolution to effectively carry out diverse biological functions including energy production, biosynthetic reactions, signaling, uptake of nutrients and active efflux, and others. This thematic issue of Chemical Reviews, \"Transporters, Porins, and Efflux Pumps\", is focused on the function of biological membranes as a permeability barrier and on the proteins that create, maintain, and bypass this barrier. Effective therapeutic interventions rely on active and passive permeation of various molecules and compounds across membranes, and our successes in development of such therapeutics are strongly affected by structural and functional insights into the assembly and function of cellular permeation barriers.","279":"Carbon capture from large sources and ambient air is one of the most promising strategies to curb the deleterious effect of greenhouse gases. Among different technologies, CO2 adsorption has drawn widespread attention mostly because of its low energy requirements. Considering that water vapor is a ubiquitous component in air and almost all CO2-rich industrial gas streams, understanding its impact on CO2 adsorption is of critical importance. Owing to the large diversity of adsorbents, water plays many different roles from a severe inhibitor of CO2 adsorption to an excellent promoter. Water may also increase the rate of CO2 capture or have the opposite effect. In the presence of amine-containing adsorbents, water is even necessary for their long-term stability. The current contribution is a comprehensive review of the effects of water whether in the gas feed or as adsorbent moisture on CO2 adsorption. For convenience, we discuss the effect of water vapor on CO2 adsorption over four broadly defined groups of materials separately, namely (i) physical adsorbents, including carbons, zeolites and MOFs, (ii) amine-functionalized adsorbents, and (iii) reactive adsorbents, including metal carbonates and oxides. For each category, the effects of humidity level on CO2 uptake, selectivity, and adsorption kinetics under different operational conditions are discussed. Whenever possible, findings from different sources are compared, paying particular attention to both similarities and inconsistencies. For completeness, the effect of water on membrane CO2 separation is also discussed, albeit briefly.","280":null,"281":"The bidentate phosphine ligand 1,2-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)benzene (1,2-DTBPMB) has been reported over the years as being one of, if not the, best ligands for achieving the alkoxycarbonylation of various unsaturated compounds. Bonded to palladium, the ligand provides the basis for the first step in the commercial (Alpha) production of methyl methacrylate as well as very high selectivity to linear esters and acids from terminal or internal double bonds. The present review is an overview covering the literature dealing with the 1,2-DTBPMB ligand: from its first reference, its catalysis, including the alkoxycarbonylation reaction and its mechanism, its isomerization abilities including the highly selective isomerizing methoxycarbonylation, other reactions such as cross-coupling, recycling approaches, and the development of improved, modified ligands, in which some tert-butyl ligands are replaced by 2-pyridyl moieties and which show exceptional rates for carbonylation reactions at low temperatures.","282":"Microemulsions, as thermodynamically stable mixtures of oil, water, and surfactant, are known and have been studied for more than 70 years. However, even today there are still quite a number of unclear aspects, and more recent research work has modified and extended our picture. This review gives a short overview of how the understanding of microemulsions has developed, the current view on their properties and structural features, and in particular, how they are related to applications. We also discuss more recent developments regarding nonclassical microemulsions such as surfactant-free (ultraflexible) microemulsions or ones containing uncommon solvents or amphiphiles (like antagonistic salts). These new findings challenge to some extent our previous understanding of microemulsions, which therefore has to be extended to look at the different types of microemulsions in a unified way. In particular, the flexibility of the amphiphilic film is the key property to classify different microemulsion types and their properties in this review. Such a classification of microemulsions requires a thorough determination of their structural properties, and therefore, the experimental methods to determine microemulsion structure and dynamics are reviewed briefly, with a particular emphasis on recent developments in the field of direct imaging by means of electron microscopy. Based on this classification of microemulsions, we then discuss their applications, where the application demands have to be met by the properties of the microemulsion, which in turn are controlled by the flexibility of their amphiphilic interface. Another frequently important aspect for applications is the control of the rheological properties. Normally, microemulsions are low viscous and therefore enhancing viscosity has to be achieved by either having high concentrations (often not wished for) or additives, which do not significantly interfere with the microemulsion. Accordingly, this review gives a comprehensive account of the properties of microemulsions, including most recent developments and bringing them together from a united viewpoint, with an emphasis on how this affects the way of formulating microemulsions for a given application with desired properties.","283":"Porous solids in the form of adsorbents and catalysts play a crucial role in various industrially important chemical, energy, and environmental processes. Formulating them into structured configurations is a key step toward their scale up and successful implementation at the industrial level. Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has emerged as an invaluable platform for shape engineering porous solids and fabricating scalable configurations for use in a wide variety of separation and reaction applications. However, formulating porous materials into self-standing configurations can dramatically affect their performance and consequently the efficiency of the process wherein they operate. Toward this end, various research groups around the world have investigated the formulation of porous adsorbents and catalysts into structured scaffolds with complex geometries that not only exhibit comparable or improved performance to that of their powder parents but also address the pressure drop and attrition issues of traditional configurations. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the recent advances and current challenges in the field of adsorption and catalysis to better guide the future directions in shape engineering solid materials with a better control on composition, structure, and properties of 3D-printed adsorbents and catalysts.","284":"Unsupervised learning is becoming an essential tool to analyze the increasingly large amounts of data produced by atomistic and molecular simulations, in material science, solid state physics, biophysics, and biochemistry. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methods of unsupervised learning that have been most commonly used to investigate simulation data and indicate likely directions for further developments in the field. In particular, we discuss feature representation of molecular systems and present state-of-the-art algorithms of dimensionality reduction, density estimation, and clustering, and kinetic models. We divide our discussion into self-contained sections, each discussing a specific method. In each section, we briefly touch upon the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of the method, highlight its strengths and limitations, and describe the specific ways in which it has been used-or can be used-to analyze molecular simulation data.","285":"Self-assembly is promising for construction of a wide variety of supramolecular assemblies, whose 1D\/2D\/3D structures are typically relevant to their functions. In-depth understanding of their structure-function relationships is essential for rational design and development of functional molecular assemblies. Microscopic imaging has been used as a powerful tool to elucidate structures of individual molecular assemblies with subnanometer to millimeter resolution, which is complementary to conventional spectroscopic techniques that provide the ensemble structural information. In this review, we highlight the representative examples of visualization of molecular assemblies by use of electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, and super-resolution microscopy. This review comprehensively describes imaging of supramolecular nanofibers\/gels, micelles\/vesicles, coacervate droplets, polymer assemblies, and protein\/DNA assemblies. Advanced imaging techniques that can address key challenges, like evaluation of dynamics of molecular assemblies, multicomponent self-assembly, and self-assembly\/disassembly in complex cellular milieu, are also discussed. We believe this review would provide guidelines for deeper structural analyses of molecular assemblies to develop the next-generation materials.","286":"The advent of genome editing has transformed the therapeutic landscape for several debilitating diseases, and the clinical outlook for gene therapeutics has never been more promising. The therapeutic potential of nucleic acids has been limited by a reliance on engineered viral vectors for delivery. Chemically defined polymers can remediate technological, regulatory, and clinical challenges associated with viral modes of gene delivery. Because of their scalability, versatility, and exquisite tunability, polymers are ideal biomaterial platforms for delivering nucleic acid payloads efficiently while minimizing immune response and cellular toxicity. While polymeric gene delivery has progressed significantly in the past four decades, clinical translation of polymeric vehicles faces several formidable challenges. The aim of our Account is to illustrate diverse concepts in designing polymeric vectors towards meeting therapeutic goals of in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy. Here, we highlight several classes of polymers employed in gene delivery and summarize the recent work on understanding the contributions of chemical and architectural design parameters. We touch upon characterization methods used to visualize and understand events transpiring at the interfaces between polymer, nucleic acids, and the physiological environment. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches and methodologies motivated by fundamental questions are key to designing high-performing polymeric vehicles for gene therapy.","287":null,"288":"Advances in hydrogel technology have unlocked unique and valuable capabilities that are being applied to a diverse set of translational applications. Hydrogels perform functions relevant to a range of biomedical purposes-they can deliver drugs or cells, regenerate hard and soft tissues, adhere to wet tissues, prevent bleeding, provide contrast during imaging, protect tissues or organs during radiotherapy, and improve the biocompatibility of medical implants. These capabilities make hydrogels useful for many distinct and pressing diseases and medical conditions and even for less conventional areas such as environmental engineering. In this review, we cover the major capabilities of hydrogels, with a focus on the novel benefits of injectable hydrogels, and how they relate to translational applications in medicine and the environment. We pay close attention to how the development of contemporary hydrogels requires extensive interdisciplinary collaboration to accomplish highly specific and complex biological tasks that range from cancer immunotherapy to tissue engineering to vaccination. We complement our discussion of preclinical and clinical development of hydrogels with mechanical design considerations needed for scaling injectable hydrogel technologies for clinical application. We anticipate that readers will gain a more complete picture of the expansive possibilities for hydrogels to make practical and impactful differences across numerous fields and biomedical applications.","289":null,"290":"Tripartite efflux pumps and the related type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) in Gram-negative organisms are diverse in function, energization, and structural organization. They form continuous conduits spanning both the inner and the outer membrane and are composed of three principal components-the energized inner membrane transporters (belonging to ABC, RND, and MFS families), the outer membrane factor channel-like proteins, and linking the two, the periplasmic adaptor proteins (PAPs), also known as the membrane fusion proteins (MFPs). In this review we summarize the recent advances in understanding of structural biology, function, and regulation of these systems, highlighting the previously undescribed role of PAPs in providing a common architectural scaffold across diverse families of transporters. Despite being built from a limited number of basic structural domains, these complexes present a staggering variety of architectures. While key insights have been derived from the RND transporter systems, a closer inspection of the operation and structural organization of different tripartite systems reveals unexpected analogies between them, including those formed around MFS- and ATP-driven transporters, suggesting that they operate around basic common principles. Based on that we are proposing a new integrated model of PAP-mediated communication within the conformational cycling of tripartite systems, which could be expanded to other types of assemblies.","291":"Aqueous electrolytes are the leading candidate to meet the surging demand for safe and low-cost storage batteries. Aqueous electrolytes facilitate more sustainable battery technologies due to the attributes of being nonflammable, environmentally benign, and cost effective. Yet, water's narrow electrochemical stability window remains the primary bottleneck for the development of high-energy aqueous batteries with long cycle life and infallible safety. Water's electrolysis leads to either hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which causes a series of dire consequences, including poor Coulombic efficiency, short device longevity, and safety issues. These are often showstoppers of a new aqueous battery technology besides the low energy density. Prolific progress has been made in the understanding of HER and OER from both catalysis and battery fields. Unfortunately, a systematic review on these advances from a battery chemistry standpoint is lacking. This review provides in-depth discussions on the mechanisms of water electrolysis on electrodes, where we summarize the critical influencing factors applicable for a broad spectrum of aqueous battery systems. Recent progress and existing challenges on suppressing water electrolysis are discussed, and our perspectives on the future development of this field are provided.","292":"The two main strategies for enzyme engineering, directed evolution and rational design, have found widespread applications in improving the intrinsic activities of proteins. Although numerous advances have been achieved using these ground-breaking methods, the limited chemical diversity of the biopolymers, restricted to the 20 canonical amino acids, hampers creation of novel enzymes that Nature has never made thus far. To address this, much research has been devoted to expanding the protein sequence space via chemical modifications and\/or incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). This review provides a balanced discussion and critical evaluation of the applications, recent advances, and technical breakthroughs in biocatalysis for three approaches: (i) chemical modification of cAAs, (ii) incorporation of ncAAs, and (iii) chemical modification of incorporated ncAAs. Furthermore, the applications of these approaches and the result on the functional properties and mechanistic study of the enzymes are extensively reviewed. We also discuss the design of artificial enzymes and directed evolution strategies for enzymes with ncAAs incorporated. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives for biocatalysis using the expanded amino acid alphabet.","293":"The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest known superfamily of secondary active transporters. MFS transporters are responsible for transporting a broad spectrum of substrates, either down their concentration gradient or uphill using the energy stored in the electrochemical gradients. Over the last 10 years, more than a hundred different MFS transporter structures covering close to 40 members have provided an atomic framework for piecing together the molecular basis of their transport cycles. Here, we summarize the remarkable promiscuity of MFS members in terms of substrate recognition and proton coupling as well as the intricate gating mechanisms undergone in achieving substrate translocation. We outline studies that show how residues far from the substrate binding site can be just as important for fine-tuning substrate recognition and specificity as those residues directly coordinating the substrate, and how a number of MFS transporters have evolved to form unique complexes with chaperone and signaling functions. Through a deeper mechanistic description of glucose (GLUT) transporters and multidrug resistance (MDR) antiporters, we outline novel refinements to the rocker-switch alternating-access model, such as a latch mechanism for proton-coupled monosaccharide transport. We emphasize that a full understanding of transport requires an elucidation of MFS transporter dynamics, energy landscapes, and the determination of how rate transitions are modulated by lipids.","294":"Separation and characterization of complex mixtures are of crucial importance in many fields, where extremely high separation power is required. Three-dimensional separation techniques can offer a path toward achieving high peak capacities. In this Review, online three-dimensional separation systems are discussed, including three-dimensional gas chromatography, and hyphenated combinations of two-dimensional gas chromatography with liquid chromatography or supercritical-fluid chromatography. Online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography provides detailed information on complex samples and the need for higher peak capacities is pushing researchers toward online three-dimensional liquid chromatography. In this review, an overview of the various combinations are provided and we discuss and compare their potential performance, advantages, perspectives, and results obtained during the most recent 10-15 years. Finally, the Review will discuss a novel approach of spatial three-dimensional liquid separation to increase peak capacity.","295":"The history of silyl cations has all the makings of a drama but with a happy ending. Being considered reactive intermediates impossible to isolate in the condensed phase for decades, their actual characterization in solution and later in solid state did only fuel the discussion about their existence and initially created a lot of controversy. This perception has completely changed today, and silyl cations and their donor-stabilized congeners are now widely accepted compounds with promising use in synthetic chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the fundamental facts and principles of the chemistry of silyl cations, including reliable ways of their preparation as well as their physical and chemical properties. The striking features of silyl cations are their enormous electrophilicity and as such reactivity as super Lewis acids as well as fluorophilicity. Known applications rely on silyl cations as reactants, stoichiometric reagents, and promoters where the reaction success is based on their steady regeneration over the course of the reaction. Silyl cations can even be discrete catalysts, thereby opening the next chapter of their way into the toolbox of synthetic methodology.","296":"Lithium (Li) metal, a typical alkaline metal, has been hailed as the \"holy grail\" anode material for next generation batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low redox reaction potential. However, the uncontrolled Li plating\/stripping issue of Li metal anodes, associated with polymorphous Li formation, \"dead Li\" accumulation, poor Coulombic efficiency, inferior cyclic stability, and hazardous safety risks (such as explosion), remains as one major roadblock for their practical applications. In principle, polymorphous Li deposits on Li metal anodes includes smooth Li (film-like Li) and a group of irregularly patterned Li (e.g., whisker-like Li (Li whiskers), moss-like Li (Li mosses), tree-like Li (Li dendrites), and their combinations). The nucleation and growth of these Li polymorphs are dominantly dependent on multiphysical fields, involving the ionic concentration field, electric field, stress field, and temperature field, etc. This review provides a clear picture and in-depth discussion on the classification and initiation\/growth mechanisms of polymorphous Li from the new perspective of multiphysical fields, particularly for irregular Li patterns. Specifically, we discuss the impact of multiphysical fields' distribution and intensity on Li plating behavior as well as their connection with the electrochemical and metallurgical properties of Li metal and some other factors (e.g., electrolyte composition, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, and initial nuclei states). Accordingly, the studies on the progress for delaying\/suppressing\/redirecting irregular Li evolution to enhance the stability and safety performance of Li metal batteries are reviewed, which are also categorized based on the multiphysical fields. Finally, an overview of the existing challenges and the future development directions of metal anodes are summarized and prospected.","297":"Degradable polymers are used widely in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Maturing capabilities in additive manufacturing coupled with advances in orthogonal chemical functionalization methodologies have enabled a rapid evolution of defect-specific form factors and strategies for designing and creating bioactive scaffolds. However, these defect-specific scaffolds, especially when utilizing degradable polymers as the base material, present processing challenges that are distinct and unique from other classes of materials. The goal of this review is to provide a guide for the fabrication of biodegradable polymer-based scaffolds that includes the complete pathway starting from selecting materials, choosing the correct fabrication method, and considering the requirements for tissue specific applications of the scaffold.","298":"Nanodimensional metal sulfides are a developing class of low-cost materials with potential applications in areas as wide-ranging as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and imaging. An attractive synthetic strategy, which allows careful control over stoichiometry, is the single source precursor (SSP) approach in which well-defined molecular species containing preformed metal-sulfur bonds are heated to decomposition, either in the vapor or solution phase, resulting in facile loss of organics and formation of nanodimensional metal sulfides. By careful control of the precursor, the decomposition environment and addition of surfactants, this approach affords a range of nanocrystalline materials from a library of precursors. Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) are monoanionic chelating ligands that have been known for over a century and find applications in agriculture, medicine, and materials science. They are easily prepared from nontoxic secondary and primary amines and form stable complexes with all elements. Since pioneering work in the late 1980s, the use of DTC complexes as SSPs to a wide range of binary, ternary, and multinary sulfides has been extensively documented. This review maps these developments, from the formation of thin films, often comprised of embedded nanocrystals, to quantum dots coated with organic ligands or shelled by other metal sulfides that show high photoluminescence quantum yields, and a range of other nanomaterials in which both the phase and morphology of the nanocrystals can be engineered, allowing fine-tuning of technologically important physical properties, thus opening up a myriad of potential applications.","299":"Hydrogels are polymer networks infiltrated with water. Many biological hydrogels in animal bodies such as muscles, heart valves, cartilages, and tendons possess extreme mechanical properties including being extremely tough, strong, resilient, adhesive, and fatigue-resistant. These mechanical properties are also critical for hydrogels' diverse applications ranging from drug delivery, tissue engineering, medical implants, wound dressings, and contact lenses to sensors, actuators, electronic devices, optical devices, batteries, water harvesters, and soft robots. Whereas numerous hydrogels have been developed over the last few decades, a set of general principles that can rationally guide the design of hydrogels using different materials and fabrication methods for various applications remain a central need in the field of soft materials. This review is aimed at synergistically reporting: (i) general design principles for hydrogels to achieve extreme mechanical and physical properties, (ii) implementation strategies for the design principles using unconventional polymer networks, and (iii) future directions for the orthogonal design of hydrogels to achieve multiple combined mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological properties. Because these design principles and implementation strategies are based on generic polymer networks, they are also applicable to other soft materials including elastomers and organogels. Overall, the review will not only provide comprehensive and systematic guidelines on the rational design of soft materials, but also provoke interdisciplinary discussions on a fundamental question: why does nature select soft materials with unconventional polymer networks to constitute the major parts of animal bodies?","300":"Aryl diazonium salts are versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. In light of the ever-increasing importance of aryl diazonium salts spanning most disciplines of the chemical sciences, we review the recent development of aryl diazonium chemistry over the past seven years (2013-2020). Special emphasis is put on various new transformations involving the generation of radical intermediates via thermal, photochemical, and electrochemical means. Recent advances in the development of transition metal-catalyzed reactions using aryl diazonium salts are also reviewed. Together, these newly developed transformations significantly expand the synthetic chemist's repertoire of aromatic carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming methods using aryl diazonium precursors, providing powerful tools for the synthesis and modification of complex molecular scaffolds.","301":"At its basic conceptualization, photoclick chemistry embodies a collection of click reactions that are performed via the application of light. The emergence of this concept has had diverse impact over a broad range of chemical and biological research due to the spatiotemporal control, high selectivity, and excellent product yields afforded by the combination of light and click chemistry. While the reactions designated as \"photoclick\" have many important features in common, each has its own particular combination of advantages and shortcomings. A more extensive realization of the potential of this chemistry requires a broader understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics of the specific reactions. This review discusses the features of the most frequently employed photoclick reactions reported in the literature: photomediated azide-alkyne cycloadditions, other 1,3-dipolarcycloadditions, Diels-Alder and inverse electron demand Diels-Alder additions, radical alternating addition chain transfer additions, and nucleophilic additions. Applications of these reactions in a variety of chemical syntheses, materials chemistry, and biological contexts are surveyed, with particular attention paid to the respective strengths and limitations of each reaction and how that reaction benefits from its combination with light. Finally, challenges to broader employment of these reactions are discussed, along with strategies and opportunities to mitigate such obstacles.","302":"In the two decades since the introduction of the \"click chemistry\" concept, the toolbox of \"click reactions\" has continually expanded, enabling chemists, materials scientists, and biologists to rapidly and selectively build complexity for their applications of interest. Similarly, selective and efficient covalent bond breaking reactions have provided and will continue to provide transformative advances. Here, we review key examples and applications of efficient, selective covalent bond cleavage reactions, which we refer to herein as \"clip reactions.\" The strategic application of clip reactions offers opportunities to tailor the compositions and structures of complex (bio)(macro)molecular systems with exquisite control. Working in concert, click chemistry and clip chemistry offer scientists and engineers powerful methods to address next-generation challenges across the chemical sciences.","303":"","304":"Protein lipid modification involves the attachment of hydrophobic groups to proteins via ester, thioester, amide, or thioether linkages. In this review, the specific click chemical reactions that have been employed to study protein lipid modification and their use for specific labeling applications are first described. This is followed by an introduction to the different types of protein lipid modifications that occur in biology. Next, the roles of click chemistry in elucidating specific biological features including the identification of lipid-modified proteins, studies of their regulation, and their role in diseases are presented. A description of the use of protein-lipid modifying enzymes for specific labeling applications including protein immobilization, fluorescent labeling, nanostructure assembly, and the construction of protein-drug conjugates is presented next. Concluding remarks and future directions are presented in the final section.","305":"Crystal phase, an intrinsic characteristic of crystalline materials, is one of the key parameters to determine their physicochemical properties. Recently, great progress has been made in the synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional phases that are different from their thermodynamically stable bulk counterparts via various synthetic methods. A nanocrystalline material can also be viewed as an assembly of atoms with long-range order. When larger entities, such as nanoclusters, nanoparticles, and microparticles, are used as building blocks, supercrystalline materials with rich phases are obtained, some of which even have no analogues in the atomic and molecular crystals. The unconventional phases of nanocrystalline and supercrystalline materials endow them with distinctive properties as compared to their conventional counterparts. This Review highlights the state-of-the-art progress of nanocrystalline and supercrystalline materials with unconventional phases constructed from multiscale building blocks, including atoms, nanoclusters, spherical and anisotropic nanoparticles, and microparticles. Emerging strategies for engineering their crystal phases are introduced, with highlights on the governing parameters that are essential for the formation of unconventional phases. Phase-dependent properties and applications of nanocrystalline and supercrystalline materials are summarized. Finally, major challenges and opportunities in future research directions are proposed.","306":"The glycocalyx, a thick layer of carbohydrates, surrounds the cell wall of most bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Recognition of these unique glycans by the human immune system results in destruction of the invaders. To elicit a protective immune response, polysaccharides either isolated from the bacterial cell surface or conjugated with a carrier protein, for T-cell help, are administered. Conjugate vaccines based on isolated carbohydrates currently protect millions of people against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitides infections. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are increasingly discovered by medicinal chemistry and synthetic in origin, rather than isolated from natural sources. Converting vaccines from biologicals to pharmaceuticals requires a fundamental understanding of how the human immune system recognizes carbohydrates and could now be realized. To illustrate the chemistry-based approach to vaccine discovery, I summarize efforts focusing on synthetic glycan-based medicinal chemistry to understand the mammalian antiglycan immune response and define glycan epitopes for novel synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other bacteria. The chemical tools described here help us gain fundamental insights into how the human system recognizes carbohydrates and drive the discovery of carbohydrate vaccines.","307":"Polymer networks are complex systems consisting of molecular components. Whereas the properties of the individual components are typically well understood by most chemists, translating that chemical insight into polymer networks themselves is limited by the statistical and poorly defined nature of network structures. As a result, it is challenging, if not currently impossible, to extrapolate from the molecular behavior of components to the full range of performance and properties of the entire polymer network. Polymer networks therefore present an unrealized, important, and interdisciplinary opportunity to exert molecular-level, chemical control on material macroscopic properties. A barrier to sophisticated molecular approaches to polymer networks is that the techniques for characterizing the molecular structure of networks are often unfamiliar to many scientists. Here, we present a critical overview of the current characterization techniques available to understand the relation between the molecular properties and the resulting performance and behavior of polymer networks, in the absence of added fillers. We highlight the methods available to characterize the chemistry and molecular-level properties of individual polymer strands and junctions, the gelation process by which strands form networks, the structure of the resulting network, and the dynamics and mechanics of the final material. The purpose is not to serve as a detailed manual for conducting these measurements but rather to unify the underlying principles, point out remaining challenges, and provide a concise overview by which chemists can plan characterization strategies that suit their research objectives. Because polymer networks cannot often be sufficiently characterized with a single method, strategic combinations of multiple techniques are typically required for their molecular characterization.","308":"Since the advent of the first computers, chemists have been at the forefront of using computers to understand and solve complex chemical problems. As the hardware and software have evolved, so have the theoretical and computational chemistry methods and algorithms. Parallel computers clearly changed the common computing paradigm in the late 1970s and 80s, and the field has again seen a paradigm shift with the advent of graphical processing units. This review explores the challenges and some of the solutions in transforming software from the terascale to the petascale and now to the upcoming exascale computers. While discussing the field in general, NWChem and its redesign, NWChemEx, will be highlighted as one of the early codesign projects to take advantage of massively parallel computers and emerging software standards to enable large scientific challenges to be tackled.","309":"The extraordinary sensitivity of plasmonic sensors is well-known in the optics and photonics community. These sensors exploit simultaneously the enhancement and the localization of electromagnetic fields close to the interface between a metal and a dielectric. This enables, for example, the design of integrated biochemical sensors at scales far below the diffraction limit. Despite their practical realization and successful commercialization, the sensitivity and associated precision of plasmonic sensors are starting to reach their fundamental classical limit given by quantum fluctuations of light-known as the shot-noise limit. To improve the sensing performance of these sensors beyond the classical limit, quantum resources are increasingly being employed. This area of research has become known as \"quantum plasmonic sensing\", and it has experienced substantial activity in recent years for applications in chemical and biological sensing. This review aims to cover both plasmonic and quantum techniques for sensing, and it shows how they have been merged to enhance the performance of plasmonic sensors beyond traditional methods. We discuss the general framework developed for quantum plasmonic sensing in recent years, covering the basic theory behind the advancements made, and describe the important works that made these advancements. We also describe several key works in detail, highlighting their motivation, the working principles behind them, and their future impact. The intention of the review is to set a foundation for a burgeoning field of research that is currently being explored out of intellectual curiosity and for a wide range of practical applications in biochemistry, medicine, and pharmaceutical research.","310":"Manipulation and navigation of micro and nanoswimmers in different fluid environments can be achieved by chemicals, external fields, or even motile cells. Many researchers have selected magnetic fields as the active external actuation source based on the advantageous features of this actuation strategy such as remote and spatiotemporal control, fuel-free, high degree of reconfigurability, programmability, recyclability, and versatility. This review introduces fundamental concepts and advantages of magnetic micro\/nanorobots (termed here as \"MagRobots\") as well as basic knowledge of magnetic fields and magnetic materials, setups for magnetic manipulation, magnetic field configurations, and symmetry-breaking strategies for effective movement. These concepts are discussed to describe the interactions between micro\/nanorobots and magnetic fields. Actuation mechanisms of flagella-inspired MagRobots (i.e., corkscrew-like motion and traveling-wave locomotion\/ciliary stroke motion) and surface walkers (i.e., surface-assisted motion), applications of magnetic fields in other propulsion approaches, and magnetic stimulation of micro\/nanorobots beyond motion are provided followed by fabrication techniques for (quasi-)spherical, helical, flexible, wire-like, and biohybrid MagRobots. Applications of MagRobots in targeted drug\/gene delivery, cell manipulation, minimally invasive surgery, biopsy, biofilm disruption\/eradication, imaging-guided delivery\/therapy\/surgery, pollution removal for environmental remediation, and (bio)sensing are also reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives for the development of magnetically powered miniaturized motors are discussed.","311":"Since their introduction about 25 years ago, machine learning (ML) potentials have become an important tool in the field of atomistic simulations. After the initial decade, in which neural networks were successfully used to construct potentials for rather small molecular systems, the development of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) in 2007 opened the way for the application of ML potentials in simulations of large systems containing thousands of atoms. To date, many other types of ML potentials have been proposed continuously increasing the range of problems that can be studied. In this review, the methodology of the family of HDNNPs including new recent developments will be discussed using a classification scheme into four generations of potentials, which is also applicable to many other types of ML potentials. The first generation is formed by early neural network potentials designed for low-dimensional systems. High-dimensional neural network potentials established the second generation and are based on three key steps: first, the expression of the total energy as a sum of environment-dependent atomic energy contributions; second, the description of the atomic environments by atom-centered symmetry functions as descriptors fulfilling the requirements of rotational, translational, and permutation invariance; and third, the iterative construction of the reference electronic structure data sets by active learning. In third-generation HDNNPs, in addition, long-range interactions are included employing environment-dependent partial charges expressed by atomic neural networks. In fourth-generation HDNNPs, which are just emerging, in addition, nonlocal phenomena such as long-range charge transfer can be included. The applicability and remaining limitations of HDNNPs are discussed along with an outlook at possible future developments.","312":null,"313":"The 1,4-conjugate addition reaction between activated alkynes or acetylenic Michael acceptors and nucleophiles (i.e., the nucleophilic Michael reaction) is a historically useful organic transformation. Despite its general utility, the efficiency and outcomes can vary widely and are often closely dependent upon specific reaction conditions. Nevertheless, with improvements in reaction design, including catalyst development and an expansion of the substrate scope to feature more electrophilic alkynes, many examples now present with features that are congruent with Click chemistry. Although several nucleophilic species can participate in these conjugate additions, ubiquitous nucleophiles such as thiols, amines, and alcohols are commonly employed and, consequently, among the most well developed. For many years, these conjugate additions were largely relegated to organic chemistry, but in the last few decades their use has expanded into other spheres such as bioorganic chemistry and polymer chemistry. Within these fields, they have been particularly useful for bioconjugation reactions and step-growth polymerizations, respectively, due to their excellent efficiency, orthogonality, and ambient reactivity. The reaction is expected to feature in increasingly divergent application settings as it continues to emerge as a Click reaction.","314":"Bacterial multidrug efflux pumps have come to prominence in human and veterinary pathogenesis because they help bacteria protect themselves against the antimicrobials used to overcome their infections. However, it is increasingly realized that many, probably most, such pumps have physiological roles that are distinct from protection of bacteria against antimicrobials administered by humans. Here we undertake a broad survey of the proteins involved, allied to detailed examples of their evolution, energetics, structures, chemical recognition, and molecular mechanisms, together with the experimental strategies that enable rapid and economical progress in understanding their true physiological roles. Once these roles are established, the knowledge can be harnessed to design more effective drugs, improve existing microbial production of drugs for clinical practice and of feedstocks for commercial exploitation, and even develop more sustainable biological processes that avoid, for example, utilization of petroleum.","315":"","316":"Fluorescence imaging techniques play a pivotal role in our understanding of the nervous system. The emergence of various super-resolution microscopy methods and specialized fluorescent probes enables direct insight into neuronal structure and protein arrangements in cellular subcompartments with so far unmatched resolution. Super-resolving visualization techniques in neurons unveil a novel understanding of cytoskeletal composition, distribution, motility, and signaling of membrane proteins, subsynaptic structure and function, and neuron-glia interaction. Well-defined molecular targets in autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease models provide excellent starting points for in-depth investigation of disease pathophysiology using novel and innovative imaging methodology. Application of super-resolution microscopy in human brain samples and for testing clinical biomarkers is still in its infancy but opens new opportunities for translational research in neurology and neuroscience. In this review, we describe how super-resolving microscopy has improved our understanding of neuronal and brain function and dysfunction in the last two decades.","317":"DNA nanotechnology has seen large developments over the last 30 years through the combination of solid phase synthesis and the discovery of DNA nanostructures. Solid phase synthesis has facilitated the availability of short DNA sequences and the expansion of the DNA toolbox to increase the chemical functionalities afforded on DNA, which in turn enabled the conception and synthesis of sophisticated and complex 2D and 3D nanostructures. In parallel, polymer science has developed several polymerization approaches to build di- and triblock copolymers bearing hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic properties. By bringing together these two emerging technologies, complementary properties of both materials have been explored; for example, the synthesis of amphiphilic DNA-polymer conjugates has enabled the production of several nanostructures, such as spherical and rod-like micelles. Through both the DNA and polymer parts, stimuli-responsiveness can be instilled. Nanostructures have consequently been developed with responsive structural changes to physical properties, such as pH and temperature, as well as short DNA through competitive complementary binding. These responsive changes have enabled the application of DNA-polymer conjugates in biomedical applications including drug delivery. This review discusses the progress of DNA-polymer conjugates, exploring the synthetic routes and state-of-the-art applications afforded through the combination of nucleic acids and synthetic polymers.","318":"This Review compiles the evolution, mechanistic understanding, and more recent advances in enantioselective Pd-catalyzed allylic substitution and decarboxylative and oxidative allylic substitutions. For each reaction, the catalytic data, as well as examples of their application to the synthesis of more complex molecules, are collected. Sections in which we discuss key mechanistic aspects for high selectivity and a comparison with other metals (with advantages and disadvantages) are also included. For Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution, the catalytic data are grouped according to the type of nucleophile employed. Because of the prominent position of the use of stabilized carbon nucleophiles and heteronucleophiles, many chiral ligands have been developed. To better compare the results, they are presented grouped by ligand types. Pd-catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative reactions are mainly promoted by PHOX or Trost ligands, which justifies organizing this section in chronological order. For asymmetric oxidative allylic substitution the results are grouped according to the type of nucleophile used.","319":"For significantly increasing the energy densities to satisfy the growing demands, new battery materials and electrochemical chemistry beyond conventional rocking-chair based Li-ion batteries should be developed urgently. Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) with the features of low cost, high safety, easy fabrication, environmental friendliness, and long cycling life have gained increasing attention. Although there are pronounced advantages of utilizing earth-abundant Al metals as negative electrodes for high energy density, such RAB technologies are still in the preliminary stage and considerable efforts will be made to further promote the fundamental and practical issues. For providing a full scope in this review, we summarize the development history of Al batteries and analyze the thermodynamics and electrode kinetics of nonaqueous RABs. The progresses on the cutting-edge of the nonaqueous RABs as well as the advanced characterizations and simulation technologies for understanding the mechanism are discussed. Furthermore, major challenges of the critical battery components and the corresponding feasible strategies toward addressing these issues are proposed, aiming to guide for promoting electrochemical performance (high voltage, high capacity, large rate capability, and long cycling life) and safety of RABs. Finally, the perspectives for the possible future efforts in this field are analyzed to thrust the progresses of the state-of-the-art RABs, with expectation of bridging the gap between laboratory exploration and practical applications.","320":"Dissolution of metals in organic solvents is relevant to various application fields, such as metal extraction from ores or secondary resources, surface etching or polishing of metals, direct synthesis of organometallic compounds, and separation of metals from other compounds. Organic solvents for dissolution of metals can offer a solution when aqueous systems fail, such as separation of metals from metal oxides, because both the metal and metal oxide could codissolve in aqueous acidic solutions. This review critically discusses organic media (conventional molecular organic solvents, ionic liquids, deep-eutectic solvents and supercritical carbon dioxide) for oxidative dissolution of metals in different application areas. The reaction mechanisms of dissolution processes are discussed for various lixiviant systems which generally consist of oxidizing agents, chelating agents, and solvents. Different oxidizing agents for dissolution of metals are reviewed such as halogens, halogenated organics, donor-acceptor electron-transfer systems, polyhalide ionic liquids, and others. Both chemical and electrochemical processes are included. The review can guide researchers to develop more efficient, economic, and environmentally friendly processes for dissolution of metals in their elemental state.","321":"Despite tremendous successes in the field of antibiotic discovery seen in the previous century, infectious diseases have remained a leading cause of death. More specifically, pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria have become a global threat due to their extraordinary ability to acquire resistance against any clinically available antibiotic, thus urging for the discovery of novel antibacterial agents. One major challenge is to design new antibiotics molecules able to rapidly penetrate Gram-negative bacteria in order to achieve a lethal intracellular drug accumulation. Protein channels in the outer membrane are known to form an entry route for many antibiotics into bacterial cells. Up until today, there has been a lack of simple experimental techniques to measure the antibiotic uptake and the local concentration in subcellular compartments. Hence, rules for translocation directly into the various Gram-negative bacteria via the outer membrane or via channels have remained elusive, hindering the design of new or the improvement of existing antibiotics. In this review, we will discuss the recent progress, both experimentally as well as computationally, in understanding the structure-function relationship of outer-membrane channels of Gram-negative pathogens, mainly focusing on the transport of antibiotics.","322":"Iron is an indispensable metabolic cofactor in both pro- and eukaryotes, which engenders a natural competition for the metal between bacterial pathogens and their human or animal hosts. Bacteria secrete siderophores that extract Fe3+ from tissues, fluids, cells, and proteins; the ligand gated porins of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane actively acquire the resulting ferric siderophores, as well as other iron-containing molecules like heme. Conversely, eukaryotic hosts combat bacterial iron scavenging by sequestering Fe3+ in binding proteins and ferritin. The variety of iron uptake systems in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens illustrates a range of chemical and biochemical mechanisms that facilitate microbial pathogenesis. This document attempts to summarize and understand these processes, to guide discovery of immunological or chemical interventions that may thwart infectious disease.","323":"Over the last 100-120 years, due to the ever-increasing importance of fluorine-containing compounds in modern technology and daily life, the explosive development of the fluorochemical industry led to an enormous increase of emission of fluoride ions into the biosphere. This made it more and more important to understand the biological activities, metabolism, degradation, and possible environmental hazards of such substances. This comprehensive and critical review focuses on the effects of fluoride ions and organofluorine compounds (mainly pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals) on human health and the environment. To give a better overview, various connected topics are also discussed: reasons and trends of the advance of fluorine-containing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, metabolism of fluorinated drugs, withdrawn fluorinated drugs, natural sources of organic and inorganic fluorine compounds in the environment (including the biosphere), sources of fluoride intake, and finally biomarkers of fluoride exposure.","324":"","325":"In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.","326":"The complex interaction of cells with biomaterials (i.e., materiobiology) plays an increasingly pivotal role in the development of novel implants, biomedical devices, and tissue engineering scaffolds to treat diseases, aid in the restoration of bodily functions, construct healthy tissues, or regenerate diseased ones. However, the conventional approaches are incapable of screening the huge amount of potential material parameter combinations to identify the optimal cell responses and involve a combination of serendipity and many series of trial-and-error experiments. For advanced tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, highly efficient and complex bioanalysis platforms are expected to explore the complex interaction of cells with biomaterials using combinatorial approaches that offer desired complex microenvironments during healing, development, and homeostasis. In this review, we first introduce materiobiology and its high-throughput screening (HTS). Then we present an in-depth of the recent progress of 2D\/3D HTS platforms (i.e., gradient and microarray) in the principle, preparation, screening for materiobiology, and combination with other advanced technologies. The Compendium for Biomaterial Transcriptomics and high content imaging, computational simulations, and their translation toward commercial and clinical uses are highlighted. In the final section, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed. High-throughput experimentation within the field of materiobiology enables the elucidation of the relationships between biomaterial properties and biological behavior and thereby serves as a potential tool for accelerating the development of high-performance biomaterials.","327":"The pancreatic peptide hormone insulin, first discovered exactly 100 years ago, is essential for glycemic control and is used as a therapeutic for the treatment of type 1 and, increasingly, type 2 diabetes. With a worsening global diabetes epidemic and its significant health budget imposition, there is a great demand for new analogues possessing improved physical and functional properties. However, the chemical synthesis of insulin's intricate 51-amino acid, two-chain, three-disulfide bond structure, together with the poor physicochemical properties of both the individual chains and the hormone itself, has long represented a major challenge to organic chemists. This review provides a timely overview of the past efforts to chemically assemble this fascinating hormone using an array of strategies to enable both correct folding of the two chains and selective formation of disulfide bonds. These methods not only have contributed to general peptide synthesis chemistry and enabled access to the greatly growing numbers of insulin-like and cystine-rich peptides but also, today, enable the production of insulin at the synthetic efficiency levels of recombinant DNA expression methods. They have led to the production of a myriad of novel analogues with optimized structural and functional features and of the feasibility for their industrial manufacture.","328":null,"329":"The past decade has witnessed ongoing progress in precision medicine to improve human health. As an emerging diagnostic technique, liquid biopsy can provide real-time, comprehensive, dynamic physiological and pathological information in a noninvasive manner, opening a new window for precision medicine. Liquid biopsy depends on the sensitive and reliable detection of circulating targets (e.g., cells, extracellular vesicles, proteins, microRNAs) from body fluids, the performance of which is largely governed by recognition ligands. Aptamers are single-stranded functional oligonucleotides, capable of folding into unique tertiary structures to bind to their targets with superior specificity and affinity. Their mature evolution procedure, facile modification, and affinity regulation, as well as versatile structural design and engineering, make aptamers ideal recognition ligands for liquid biopsy. In this review, we present a broad overview of aptamer-based liquid biopsy techniques for precision medicine. We begin with recent advances in aptamer selection, followed by a summary of state-of-the-art strategies for multivalent aptamer assembly and aptamer interface modification. We will further describe aptamer-based micro-\/nanoisolation platforms, aptamer-enabled release methods, and aptamer-assisted signal amplification and detection strategies. Finally, we present our perspectives regarding the opportunities and challenges of aptamer-based liquid biopsy for precision medicine.","330":"Click chemistry has been established rapidly as one of the most valuable methods for the chemical transformation of complex molecules. Due to the rapid rates, clean conversions to the products, and compatibility of the reagents and reaction conditions even in complex settings, it has found applications in many molecule-oriented disciplines. From the vast landscape of click reactions, approaches have emerged in the past decade centered around oxidative processes to generate in situ highly reactive synthons from dormant functionalities. These approaches have led to some of the fastest click reactions know to date. Here, we review the various methods that can be used for such oxidation-induced \"one-pot\" click chemistry for the transformation of small molecules, materials, and biomolecules. A comprehensive overview is provided of oxidation conditions that induce a click reaction, and oxidation conditions are orthogonal to other click reactions so that sequential \"click-oxidation-click\" derivatization of molecules can be performed in one pot. Our review of the relevant literature shows that this strategy is emerging as a powerful approach for the preparation of high-performance materials and the generation of complex biomolecules. As such, we expect that oxidation-induced \"one-pot\" click chemistry will widen in scope substantially in the forthcoming years.","331":"This review covers all aspects of 9-borafluorene chemistry, from the first attempted synthesis in 1960 to the present. This class of molecules consists of a tricyclic system featuring a central antiaromatic BC4 ring with two fused arene groups. The synthetic routes to all 9-borafluorenes and their adducts are presented. The Lewis acidity and photophysical properties outlined demonstrate potential utility as sensors and in electronic materials. The reactivity of borafluorenes reveals their prospects as reagents for the synthesis of other boron-containing molecules. The appealing traits of 9-borafluorenes have stimulated investigations into analogues that bear different aromatic groups fused to the central BC4 ring. Finally, we offer our views on the challenges and future of borafluorene chemistry.","332":"Cyclopentadiene is one of the most reactive dienes in normal electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions. The high reactivities and yields of cyclopentadiene cycloadditions make them ideal as click reactions. In this review, we discuss the history of the cyclopentadiene cycloaddition as well as applications of cyclopentadiene click reactions. Our emphasis is on experimental and theoretical studies on the reactivity and stability of cyclopentadiene and cyclopentadiene derivatives.","333":"Nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the few nanotechnologies to have attained mass market applications with their use as light sources for displays. This success relies on Cd- and In-based wide bandgap materials. NCs are likely to be employed in more applications as they provide a versatile platform for optoelectronics, specifically, infrared optoelectronics. The existing material technologies in this range of wavelengths are generally not cost-effective, which limits the spread of technologies beyond a few niche domains, such as defense and astronomy. Among the potential candidates to address the infrared window, mercury chalcogenide (HgX) NCs exhibit the highest potential in terms of performance. In this review, we discuss how material developments have facilitated device enhancements. Because these materials are mainly used for their infrared optical features, we first review the strategies for their colloidal growth and their specific electronic structure. The review is organized considering three main device-related applications: light emission, electronic transport, and infrared photodetection.","334":"Aliphatic azides are a versatile class of compounds found in a variety of biologically active pharmaceuticals. These compounds are also recognized as useful precursors for the synthesis of a range of nitrogen-based scaffolds of therapeutic drugs, biologically active compounds, and functional materials. In light of the growing importance of aliphatic azides in both chemical and biological sciences, a vast array of synthetic strategies for the preparation of structurally diverse aliphatic azides have been developed over the past decades. However, to date, this topic has not been the subject of a dedicated review. This review aims to provide a concise overview of modern synthetic strategies to access aliphatic azides that have emerged since 2010. The discussed azidation reactions include (a) azidation of C-C multiple bonds, (b) azidation of C-H bonds, (c) the direct transformation of vinyl azides into other aliphatic azides, and (d) miscellaneous reactions to access aliphatic azides. We critically discuss the synthetic outcomes and the generality and uniqueness of the different mechanistic rationale of each of the selected reactions. The challenges and potential opportunities of the topic are outlined.","335":"Research directed toward the goal of molecular gyroscopes since the coverage of a previous review (2002) is described. Such species are a subclass of molecular rotors, which are comprised of rotators and stators. Major categories include (1) systems in which a rotator is embedded in a cage-like stator reminiscent of mechanical toy gyroscopes and (2) molecules that have been engineered to crystallize with parallel rotators and voids or other features that enable the rotator to rotate in the solid state (amphidynamic crystals). Particular attention is given to structural data and strategies for the minimization of rotational barriers. Synthetic routes are also described. Some allied types of molecules and supramolecular assemblies are also treated.","336":"Among the recent developments in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), porous layered coordination polymers (CPs) have garnered attention due to their modular nature and tunable structures. These factors enable a number of properties and applications, including gas and guest sorption, storage and separation of gases and small molecules, catalysis, luminescence, sensing, magnetism, and energy storage and conversion. Among MOFs, two-dimensional (2D) compounds are also known as 2D CPs or 2D MOFs. Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, 2D materials have also been widely studied. Several 2D MOFs are suitable for exfoliation as ultrathin nanosheets similar to graphene and other 2D materials, making these layered structures useful and unique for various technological applications. Furthermore, these layered structures have fascinating topological networks and entanglements. This review provides an overview of different aspects of 2D MOF layered architectures such as topology, interpenetration, structural transformations, properties, and applications.","337":"The allene functionality has participated in one of the most exciting voyages in organic chemistry, from chemical curiosities to a recurring building block in modern organic chemistry. In the last decades, a special kind of allene, namely, allenol, has emerged. Allenols, formed by an allene moiety and a hydroxyl functional group with diverse connectivity, have become common building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of structures and frequent motif in naturally occurring systems. The synergistic effect of the allene and hydroxyl functional groups enables allenols to be considered as a unique and sole functionality exhibiting a special reactivity. This Review summarizes the most significant contributions to the chemistry of allenols that appeared during the past decade, with emphasis on their synthesis, reactivity, and occurrence in natural products.","338":"","339":"Electrides are materials in which electrons serve as anions. Here, the concept of inorganic electrides is extended in several respects: from ionic crystals to intermetallic compounds in host materials, from crystalline to amorphous solids, and from 0-dimensional to 1- and 2-dimensional materials in electron-confined spaces. In particular, 2D electrides, in which anionic electrons are sandwiched by cationic slabs, can form a bulk crystal of a 2-dimensional electron gas, thus exhibiting a large electron mobility and providing a platform for topological materials. Exploration of new electrides by computation and high pressure has advanced, revealing that an electride is a stable equilibrium phase of many elements and compounds under high pressure. This review describes the history and current status of electride research and next summarizes the chemical application of electrides and relevant materials. An emphasis is placed on catalysts for ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 at mild conditions. This subject is accelerated by a demand for on-site ammonia synthesis using hydrogen produced by renewable energy sources. A wide applicability of electride for chemical reactions such selective hydrogenation and carbon-carbon coupling is shown by extending the concept of electrides. Finally, a view for the relationship between electrides and crystallographic voids and current issues are described.","340":"The use of life-saving antibiotics has long been plagued by the ability of pathogenic bacteria to acquire and develop an array of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. The sum of these resistance mechanisms, the antibiotic resistome, is a formidable threat to antibiotic discovery, development, and use. The study and understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the resistome provide the basis for traditional approaches to combat resistance, including semisynthetic modification of naturally occurring antibiotic scaffolds, the development of adjuvant therapies that overcome resistance mechanisms, and the total synthesis of new antibiotics and their analogues. Using two major classes of antibiotics, the aminoglycosides and tetracyclines as case studies, we review the success and limitations of these strategies when used to combat the many forms of resistance that have emerged toward natural product-based antibiotics specifically. Furthermore, we discuss the use of the resistome as a guide for the genomics-driven discovery of novel antimicrobials, which are essential to combat the growing number of emerging pathogens that are resistant to even the newest approved therapies.","341":"Fabricating a porous scaffold with high surface area has been a major strategy in the tissue engineering field. Among the many fabrication methods, electrospinning has become one of the cornerstone techniques due to its enabling the fabrication of highly porous fibrous scaffolds that are of natural or synthetic origin. Apart from the basic requirements of mechanical stability and biocompatibility, scaffolds are further expected to embody functional cues that drive cellular functions such as adhesion, spreading, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. There are abundant distinct approaches to introducing bioactive molecules to have a control over cellular functions. However, the lack of a thorough understanding of cell behavior with respect to the availability and spatial distribution of the bioactive molecules in 3D fibrous scaffolds is yet to be addressed. The rational selection of proper sets of characterization techniques would essentially impact the interpretation of the cell-scaffold interactions. In this timely Review, we summarize the most popular methods to introduce functional compounds to electrospun fibers. Thereafter, the strength and limitations of the conventional characterization methods are highlighted. Finally, the potential and applicability of emerging characterization techniques such as high-resolution\/correlative microscopy approaches are further discussed.","342":"Arynes are among the most active organic intermediates and have found numerous applications in expeditious preparation of substituted arenes. In the past 20 years, chemists have witnessed a resurgence in aryne chemistry, which is mainly attributed by the extensive utilization of Kobayashi's method, a fluoride-induced removal of the TMS group with concomitant departure of its ortho OTf group on o-silylaryl triflates. Nowadays, o-silylaryl triflates are the most frequently employed aryne precursors. This review provides an overview of the history of Kobayashi's method, its methodological achievements, and its applications in the synthesis of natural products, bioactive molecules, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.","343":"Cell envelope plays a dual role in the life of bacteria by simultaneously protecting it from a hostile environment and facilitating access to beneficial molecules. At the heart of this ability lie the restrictive properties of the cellular membrane augmented by efflux transporters, which preclude intracellular penetration of most molecules except with the help of specialized uptake mediators. Recently, kinetic properties of the cell envelope came into focus driven on one hand by the urgent need in new antibiotics and, on the other hand, by experimental and theoretical advances in studies of transmembrane transport. A notable result from these studies is the development of a kinetic formalism that integrates the Michaelis-Menten behavior of individual transporters with transmembrane diffusion and offers a quantitative basis for the analysis of intracellular penetration of bioactive compounds. This review surveys key experimental and computational approaches to the investigation of transport by individual translocators and in whole cells, summarizes key findings from these studies and outlines implications for antibiotic discovery. Special emphasis is placed on Gram-negative bacteria, whose envelope contains two separate membranes. This feature sets these organisms apart from Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotic cells by providing them with full benefits of the synergy between slow transmembrane diffusion and active efflux.","344":"This Review presents and discusses the current state of the art in \"exchangeable liquid crystalline elastomers\", that is, LCE materials utilizing dynamically cross-linked networks capable of reprocessing, reprogramming, and recycling. The focus here is on the chemistry and the specific reaction mechanisms that enable the dynamic bond exchange, of which there is a variety. We compare and contrast these different chemical mechanisms and the key properties of their resulting elastomers. In the conclusion, we discuss the most promising applications that are enabled by dynamic cross-linking and present a summary table: a library of currently available materials and their main characteristics.","345":"Organoboron compounds have important synthetic value and can be applied in numerous transformations. The development of practical and convenient ways to synthesize boronate esters has thus attracted significant interest. Photoinduced borylations originated from stoichiometric reactions of alkanes and arenes with well-defined metal-boryl complexes. Now, photoredox-initiated borylations, catalyzed by either transition metal or organic photocatalysts, and photochemical borylations with high efficiency have become a burgeoning area of research. In this Focus Review, we summarize research on photoinduced borylations, especially emphasizing recent developments and trends. This includes the photoinduced borylation of arenes, alkanes, aryl\/alkyl halides, activated carboxylic acids, amines, alcohols, and so on based on transition metal catalysis, metal-free organocatalysis, and direct photochemical activation. We focus on reaction mechanisms involving single-electron transfer, triplet-energy transfer, and other radical processes.","346":"Superconductors with exotic physical properties are critical to current and future technology. In this review, we highlight several important superconducting families and focus on their crystal structure, chemical bonding, and superconductivity correlations. We connect superconducting materials with chemical bonding interactions based on their structure-property relationships, elucidating our empirically chemical approaches and other methods used in the discovery of new superconductors. Furthermore, we provide some technical strategies to synthesize superconductors and basic but important characterization for chemists needed when reporting new superconductors. In the end, we share our thoughts on how to make new superconductors and where chemists can work on in the superconductivity field. This review is written using chemical terms, with a focus on providing some chemically intuitive thoughts on superconducting materials design.","347":"Homogeneous gold catalysis has experienced extraordinary development since the dawn of this millennium. Oxidative gold catalysis is a vibrant and fertile subfield and has over the years delivered a diverse array of versatile synthetic methods of exceptional value to synthetic practices. This review aims to cover this topic in a comprehensive manner. The discussions are organized by the mechanistic aspects of the metal oxidation states and further by the types of oxidants or oxidizing functional groups. Synthetic applications of oxidative gold catalysis are also discussed.","348":"Aliphatic polycarbonates have gained increased attention as biomaterials largely owing to their biocompatibility and tunable degradation. Moreover, the ability to introduce functional handles in the polymer backbone through careful design of cyclic carbonate monomers or copolymerization with other biodegradable polymers has significantly contributed to the interest in exploiting this class of materials for biomedical applications. Such investigations have enabled their utility to be expanded to a wide variety of applications in the biomedical field, from drug delivery to tissue regeneration and the design of vascular grafts. Herein, we review the synthesis, degradation, and studies into biomedical applications of aliphatic polycarbonates obtained by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate monomers (ring sizes between 6 and 8). While all synthetic methods will be covered, particular emphasis will be given to materials that have been exploited for therapeutic applications in vitro and in vivo.","349":null,"350":"Asymmetric allylic alkylation mediated by transition metals provides an efficient strategy to form quaternary stereogenic centers. While this transformation is dominated by the use of second- and third-row transition metals (e.g., Pd, Rh, and Ir), recent developments have revealed the potential of first-row transition metals, which provide not only a less expensive and potentially equally efficient alternative but also new mechanistic possibilities. This review summarizes examples for the assembly of quaternary stereocenters using prochiral allylic substrates and hard, achiral nucleophiles in the presence of copper complexes and highlights the complementary approaches with soft, prochiral nucleophiles catalyzed by chiral cobalt and nickel complexes.","351":"In recent decades, peptides, which can possess high potency, excellent selectivity, and low toxicity, have emerged as promising therapeutics for cancer applications. Combined with an improved understanding of tumor biology and immuno-oncology, peptides have demonstrated robust antitumor efficacy in preclinical tumor models. However, the translation of peptides with intracellular targets into clinical therapies has been severely hindered by limitations in their intrinsic structure, such as low systemic stability, rapid clearance, and poor membrane permeability, that impede intracellular delivery. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in polymer-mediated intracellular delivery of peptides for cancer therapy, including both therapeutic peptides and peptide antigens. We highlight strategies to engineer polymeric materials to increase peptide delivery efficiency, especially cytosolic delivery, which plays a crucial role in potentiating peptide-based therapies. Finally, we discuss future opportunities for peptides in cancer treatment, with an emphasis on the design of polymer nanocarriers for optimized peptide delivery.","352":null,"353":"Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of atomic structures, compositions, and associated versatility of properties. Furthermore, for a given composition, a variety of different crystal structures (i.e., polymorphs) can be observed. Polymorphism in 2D materials presents a fertile landscape for designing novel architectures and imparting new functionalities. The objective of this Review is to identify the polymorphs of emerging 2D materials, describe their polymorph-dependent properties, and outline methods used for polymorph control. Since traditional 2D materials (e.g., graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides) have already been studied extensively, the focus here is on polymorphism in post-dichalcogenide 2D materials including group III, IV, and V elemental 2D materials, layered group III, IV, and V metal chalcogenides, and 2D transition metal halides. In addition to providing a comprehensive survey of recent experimental and theoretical literature, this Review identifies the most promising opportunities for future research including how 2D polymorph engineering can provide a pathway to materials by design.","354":null,"355":null,"356":"The emergence of new pathogens and multidrug resistant bacteria is an important public health issue that requires the development of novel classes of antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising platform with great potential for the identification of new lead compounds that can combat the aforementioned pathogens due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and relatively low rate of resistance emergence. AMPs of multicellular organisms made their debut four decades ago thanks to ingenious researchers who asked simple questions about the resistance to bacterial infections of insects. Questions such as \"Do fruit flies ever get sick?\", combined with pioneering studies, have led to an understanding of AMPs as universal weapons of the immune system. This review focuses on a subclass of AMPs that feature a metal binding motif known as the amino terminal copper and nickel (ATCUN) motif. One of the metal-based strategies of hosts facing a pathogen, it includes wielding the inherent toxicity of copper and deliberately trafficking this metal ion into sites of infection. The sudden increase in the concentration of copper ions in the presence of ATCUN-containing AMPs (ATCUN-AMPs) likely results in a synergistic interaction. Herein, we examine common structural features in ATCUN-AMPs that exist across species, and we highlight unique features that deserve additional attention. We also present the current state of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms behind their antimicrobial activity and the methods available to study this promising class of AMPs.","357":"Over the past 15 years, the field of microrobotics has exploded with many research groups from around the globe contributing to numerous innovations that have led to exciting new capabilities and important applications, ranging from in vivo drug delivery, to intracellular biosensing, environmental remediation, and nanoscale fabrication. Smart responsive materials have had a profound impact on the field of microrobotics and have imparted small-scale robots with new functionalities and distinct capabilities. We have identified four large categories where the majority of future efforts must be allocated to push the frontiers of microrobots and where smart materials can have a major impact on such future advances. These four areas are the propulsion and biocompatibility of microrobots, the cooperation between individual units and human operators, and finally, the intelligence of microrobots. In this Review, we look critically at the latest developments in these four categories and discuss how smart materials contribute to the progress in the exciting field of microrobotics and will set the stage for the next generation of intelligent and programmable microrobots.","358":"Polymeric tissue adhesives provide versatile materials for wound management and are widely used in a variety of medical settings ranging from minor to life-threatening tissue injuries. Compared to the traditional methods of wound closure (i.e., suturing and stapling), they are relatively easy to use, enable rapid application, and introduce minimal tissue damage. Furthermore, they can act as hemostats to control bleeding and provide a tissue-healing environment at the wound site. Despite their numerous current applications, tissue adhesives still face several limitations and unresolved challenges (e.g., weak adhesion strength and poor mechanical properties) that limit their use, leaving ample room for future improvements. Successful development of next-generation adhesives will likely require a holistic understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the tissue-adhesive interface, fundamental mechanisms of tissue adhesion, and requirements for specific clinical applications. In this review, we discuss a set of rational guidelines for design of adhesives, recent progress in the field along with examples of commercially available adhesives and those under development, tissue-specific considerations, and finally potential functions for future adhesives. Advances in tissue adhesives will open new avenues for wound care and potentially provide potent therapeutics for various medical applications.","359":"HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme that plays a major role in the replication cycle of HIV and has been a key target of anti-HIV drug development efforts. Because of the high genetic diversity of the virus, mutations in RT can impart resistance to various RT inhibitors. As the prevalence of drug resistance mutations is on the rise, it is necessary to design strategies that will lead to drugs less susceptible to resistance. Here we provide an in-depth review of HIV reverse transcriptase, current RT inhibitors, novel RT inhibitors, and mechanisms of drug resistance. We also present novel strategies that can be useful to overcome RT's ability to escape therapies through drug resistance. While resistance may not be completely avoidable, designing drugs based on the strategies and principles discussed in this review could decrease the prevalence of drug resistance.","360":"","361":"The hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) reaction is the thermal cyclization of an alkyne and a 1,3-diyne to generate a benzyne intermediate. This is then rapidly trapped, in situ, by a variety of species to yield highly functionalized benzenoid products. In contrast to nearly all other methods of aryne generation, no other reagents are required to produce an HDDA benzyne. The versatile and customizable nature of the process has attracted much attention due not only to its synthetic potential but also because of the fundamental mechanistic insights the studies often afford. The authors have attempted to provide here a comprehensive compilation of publications appearing by mid-2020 that describe experimental results of HDDA reactions.","362":"Since the first connection between Fenton chemistry and biomedicine, numerous studies have been presented in this field. Comprehensive presentation of the guidance from Fenton chemistry and a summary of its representative applications in cancer therapy would help us understand and promote the further development of this field. This comprehensive review first supplies basic information regarding Fenton chemistry, including Fenton reactions and Fenton-like reactions. Subsequently, the current progress of Fenton chemistry is discussed, with some corresponding representative examples presented. Furthermore, the current strategies for further optimizing the performance of chemodynamic therapy guided by Fenton chemistry are highlighted. Most importantly, future perspectives on the combination of biomedicine with Fenton chemistry or a wider range of catalytic chemistry approaches are presented. We hope that this review will attract positive attention in the chemistry, materials science, and biomedicine fields and further tighten their connections.","363":"Within the wide family of gold-catalyzed reactions, gold photocatalysis intrinsically features unique elementary steps. When gold catalysis meets photocatalysis, a valence change of the gold center can easily be achieved via electron transfer and radical addition, avoiding the use of stoichiometric sacrificial external oxidants. The excellent compatibility of radicals with gold catalysts opens the door to a series of important organic transformations, including redox-neutral C-C and C-X coupling, C-H activation, and formal radical-radical cross-coupling. The photocatalysis with gold complexes nicely complements the existing photoredox catalysis strategies and also opens a new avenue for gold chemistry. This review covers the achieved transformations for both mononuclear gold(I) catalysts (with and without a photosensitizer) and dinuclear gold(I) photocatalysts. Various fascinating methodologies, their value for organic chemists, and the current mechanistic understanding are discussed. The most recent examples also demonstrate the feasibility of both, mononuclear and dinuclear gold(I) complexes to participate in excited state energy transfer (EnT), rather than electron transfer. The rare applications of gold(III) photocatalysts, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, are also summarized.","364":"Doping mobile carriers into ordinary semiconductors such as Si, GaAs, and ZnO was the enabling step in the electronic and optoelectronic revolutions. The recent emergence of a class of \"quantum materials\", where uniquely quantum interactions between the components produce specific behaviors such as topological insulation, unusual magnetism, superconductivity, spin-orbit-induced and magnetically induced spin splitting, polaron formation, and transparency of electrical conductors, pointed attention to a range of doping-related phenomena associated with chemical classes that differ from the traditional semiconductors. These include wide-gap oxides, compounds containing open-shell d electrons, and compounds made of heavy elements yet having significant band gaps. The atomistic electronic structure theory of doping that has been developed over the past two decades in the subfield of semiconductor physics has recently been extended and applied to quantum materials. The present review focuses on explaining the main concepts needed for a basic understanding of the doping phenomenology and indeed peculiarities in quantum materials from the perspective of condensed matter theory, with the hope of forging bridges to the chemists that have enabled the synthesis of some of the most interesting compounds in this field.","365":"Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have emerged as outstanding semiconducting materials thanks to their superior stability and structural diversity. However, the ever-growing field of optoelectronic device research using 2D perovskites requires systematic understanding of the effects of the spacer on the structure, properties, and device performance. So far, many studies are based on trial-and-error tests of random spacers with limited ability to predict the resulting structure of these synthetic experiments, hindering the discovery of novel 2D materials to be incorporated into high-performance devices. In this review, we provide guidelines on successfully choosing spacers and incorporating them into crystalline materials and optoelectronic devices. We first provide a summary of various synthetic methods to act as a tutorial for groups interested in pursuing synthesis of novel 2D perovskites. Second, we provide our insights on what kind of spacer cations can stabilize 2D perovskites followed by an extensive review of the spacer cations, which have been shown to stabilize 2D perovskites with an emphasis on the effects of the spacer on the structure and optical properties. Next, we provide a similar explanation for the methods used to fabricate films and their desired properties. Like the synthesis section, we will then focus on various spacers that have been used in devices and how they influence the film structure and device performance. With a comprehensive understanding of these effects, a rational selection of novel spacers can be made, accelerating this already exciting field.","366":"Gold catalysis has proven to be an important breakthrough for organic synthesis. The tunable nature of gold catalysts, the unique properties of gold, and the mild reaction conditions required in many gold-catalyzed reactions have all contributed substantially to this metal's popularity in catalysis. However, gold-catalyzed reactions still suffer from limitations such as low turnover numbers (TON). Optimization of the catalysts and reaction conditions may significantly improve the efficiency of gold-catalyzed reactions. In this review, we will present leading examples of counterion or additive-regulated gold catalysis from a mechanistic perspective. We will pay special attention to the physical properties of counterion\/additive, such as gold affinity and hydrogen bond basicity, and discuss their effects on the reactivity of gold catalysts.","367":"Molecular recognition in water using macrocyclic synthetic receptors constitutes a vibrant and timely research area of supramolecular chemistry. Pioneering examples on the topic date back to the 1980s. The investigated model systems and the results derived from them are key for furthering our understanding of the remarkable properties exhibited by proteins: high binding affinity, superior binding selectivity, and extreme catalytic performance. Dissecting the different effects contributing to the proteins' properties is severely limited owing to its complex nature. Molecular recognition in water is also involved in other appreciated areas such as self-assembly, drug discovery, and supramolecular catalysis. The development of all these research areas entails a deep understanding of the molecular recognition events occurring in aqueous media. In this review, we cover the past three decades of molecular recognition studies of neutral and charged, polar and nonpolar organic substrates and ions using selected artificial receptors soluble in water. We briefly discuss the intermolecular forces involved in the reversible binding of the substrates, as well as the hydrophobic and Hofmeister effects operating in aqueous solution. We examine, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the design and development of effective water-soluble synthetic receptors based on cyclic, oligo-cyclic, and concave-shaped architectures. We also include selected examples of self-assembled water-soluble synthetic receptors. The catalytic performance of some of the presented receptors is also described. The latter process also deals with molecular recognition and energetic stabilization, but instead of binding ground-state species, the targets become elusive counterparts: transition states and other high-energy intermediates.","368":"This review focuses on key components of respiratory and photosynthetic energy-transduction systems: the cytochrome bc1 and b6f (Cytbc1\/b6f) membranous multisubunit homodimeric complexes. These remarkable molecular machines catalyze electron transfer from membranous quinones to water-soluble electron carriers (such as cytochromes c or plastocyanin), coupling electron flow to proton translocation across the energy-transducing membrane and contributing to the generation of a transmembrane electrochemical potential gradient, which powers cellular metabolism in the majority of living organisms. Cytsbc1\/b6f share many similarities but also have significant differences. While decades of research have provided extensive knowledge on these enzymes, several important aspects of their molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We summarize a broad range of structural, mechanistic, and physiological aspects required for function of Cytbc1\/b6f, combining textbook fundamentals with new intriguing concepts that have emerged from more recent studies. The discussion covers but is not limited to (i) mechanisms of energy-conserving bifurcation of electron pathway and energy-wasting superoxide generation at the quinol oxidation site, (ii) the mechanism by which semiquinone is stabilized at the quinone reduction site, (iii) interactions with substrates and specific inhibitors, (iv) intermonomer electron transfer and the role of a dimeric complex, and (v) higher levels of organization and regulation that involve Cytsbc1\/b6f. In addressing these topics, we point out existing uncertainties and controversies, which, as suggested, will drive further research in this field.","369":"Spontaneous deracemizations is a challenging, multidisciplinary subject in current chirality research. In the absence of any chiral inductors, an achiral substance or a racemic composition is driven into an enantioenriched or even homochiral state through a selective energy input, e.g., chemical potential, photoirradiation, mechanical grinding, ultrasound waves, thermal gradients, etc. The most prominent examples of such transformations are the Soai reaction and the Viedma deracemization. In this review, we track the most recent developments in this topic and recall that many other deracemizations have been reported for solutions from mesophases to conglomerate crystallizations. A compiled set of simply available achiral organic, inorganic, organometallic, and MOF compounds, yielding conglomerate crystals, should give the impetus to realize new experiments on spontaneous deracemizations. Taking into account thermodynamic constraints, modeling efforts have shown that structural features alone are not sufficient to describe spontaneous deracemizations. As a guideline of this review, particular attention is paid to the physicochemical origin and symmetry requirements of such processes.","370":"Bioorthogonal chemical reactions have emerged as convenient and rapid methods for incorporating unnatural functionality into living systems. Different prototype reactions have been optimized for use in biological settings. Optimization of 3 + 2 dipolar cycloadditions involving nitrones has resulted in highly efficient reaction conditions for bioorthogonal chemistry. Through substitution at the nitrone carbon or nitrogen atom, stereoelectronic tuning of the reactivity of the dipole has assisted in optimizing reactivity. Nitrones have been shown to react rapidly with cyclooctynes with bimolecular rate constants approaching k2 = 102 M-1 s-1, which are among the fastest bioorthogonal reactions reported (McKay et al. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2012, 10, 3066-3070). Nitrones have also been shown to react with trans-cyclooctenes (TCO) in strain-promoted TCO-nitrone cycloadditions reactions. Copper catalyzed reactions involving alkynes and nitrones have also been optimized for applications in biology. This review provides a comprehensive accounting of the different bioorthogonal reactions that have been developed using nitrones as versatile reactants, and provides some recent examples of applications for probing biological systems.","371":"Biocompatible conductors are important components for soft and stretchable bioelectronics for digital healthcare, which have attracted extensive research efforts. Natural biopolymers, compared to other polymers, possess unique features that make them promising building blocks for biocompatible conductors, such as good biocompatibility\/biodegradability, natural abundance, sustainability, and capability, can be processed into various functional formats with tunable material properties under benign conditions. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the recent advances in biocompatible conductors based on natural biopolymers for stretchable bioelectronics. We first give a brief introduction of conductive components and natural polymers and summarize the recent development of biocompatible conductors based on representative natural biopolymers including protein (silk), polypeptide (gelatin), and polysaccharide (alginate). The design and fabrication strategies for biocompatible conductors based on these representative biopolymers are outlined, after the chemical structure and properties of such biopolymers are presented. Then we discuss the electronic component-biopolymer interface and bioelectronic-biological tissue (skin and internal tissues) interface, highlight various fabrication techniques of biocompatible conductors for soft bioelectronics, and introduce representative examples of utilizing natural biopolymer-based biocompatible conductors for on-skin bioelectronics, textile-based wearable electronics, and implantable bioelectronics for digital healthcare. Finally, we present concluding remarks on challenges and prospects for designing natural biopolymers for soft biocompatible conductors and bioelectronics.","372":"This review gives an account on the fast expanding field of monomeric (or molecular) heptazines, at the exclusion of their various polymeric forms, often referred to as carbon nitrides. While examples of monomeric heptazines were extremely limited until the beginning of this century, the field has started expanding quickly since then, as has the number of reports on polymeric materials, though previous reviews did not separate these fields. We provide here a detailed report on the synthetic procedures for molecular heptazines. We also extensively report on the different achievements realized from these new molecules, in the fields of physical chemistry, spectroscopy, materials preparation, (photo)catalysis, and devices. After a comprehensive summary and discussion on heptazines syntheses and characteristics, we show that starting from well-defined molecules allows a versatility of approaches and a wide tunability of the expected properties. It comes out that the field of monomeric heptazines is now emerging and possibly heading toward maturity, while diverging from the one of polymeric carbon nitrides. It is likely that this area of research will quickly surge to the forefront of the search for active organic molecules, with special attention to the domains of catalysis and organic-based functional materials and devices.","373":"Nanomaterial (NM) delivery to solid tumors has been the focus of intense research for over a decade. Classically, scientists have tried to improve NM delivery by employing passive or active targeting strategies, making use of the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon is made possible due to the leaky tumor vasculature through which NMs can leave the bloodstream, traverse through the gaps in the endothelial lining of the vessels, and enter the tumor. Recent studies have shown that despite many efforts to employ the EPR effect, this process remains very poor. Furthermore, the role of the EPR effect has been called into question, where it has been suggested that NMs enter the tumor via active mechanisms and not through the endothelial gaps. In this review, we provide a short overview of the EPR and mechanisms to enhance it, after which we focus on alternative delivery strategies that do not solely rely on EPR in itself but can offer interesting pharmacological, physical, and biological solutions for enhanced delivery. We discuss the strengths and shortcomings of these different strategies and suggest combinatorial approaches as the ideal path forward.","374":"Click chemistry is an immensely powerful technique for the fast and efficient covalent conjugation of molecular entities. Its broad scope has positively impacted on multiple scientific disciplines, and its implementation within the nucleic acid field has enabled researchers to generate a wide variety of tools with application in biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. Azide-alkyne cycloadditions (AAC) are still the leading technology among click reactions due to the facile modification and incorporation of azide and alkyne groups within biological scaffolds. Application of AAC chemistry to nucleic acids allows labeling, ligation, and cyclization of oligonucleotides efficiently and cost-effectively relative to previously used chemical and enzymatic techniques. In this review, we provide a guide to inexperienced and knowledgeable researchers approaching the field of click chemistry with nucleic acids. We discuss in detail the chemistry, the available modified-nucleosides, and applications of AAC reactions in nucleic acid chemistry and provide a critical view of the advantages, limitations, and open-questions within the field.","375":"Because of their efficiency, selectivity, and environmental sustainability, there are significant opportunities for enzymes in chemical synthesis and biotechnology. However, as the three-dimensional active structure of enzymes is predominantly maintained by weaker noncovalent interactions, thermal, pH, and chemical stressors can modify or eliminate activity. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are extended porous network materials assembled by a bottom-up building block approach from metal-based nodes and organic linkers, can be used to afford protection to enzymes. The self-assembled structures of MOFs can be used to encase an enzyme in a process called encapsulation when the MOF is synthesized in the presence of the biomolecule. Alternatively, enzymes can be infiltrated into mesoporous MOF structures or surface bound via covalent or noncovalent processes. Integration of MOF materials and enzymes in this way affords protection and allows the enzyme to maintain activity in challenge conditions (e.g., denaturing agents, elevated temperature, non-native pH, and organic solvents). In addition to forming simple enzyme\/MOF biocomposites, other materials can be introduced to the composites to improve recovery or facilitate advanced applications in sensing and fuel cell technology. This review canvasses enzyme protection via encapsulation, pore infiltration, and surface adsorption and summarizes strategies to form multicomponent composites. Also, given that enzyme\/MOF biocomposites straddle materials chemistry and enzymology, this review provides an assessment of the characterization methodologies used for MOF-immobilized enzymes and identifies some key parameters to facilitate development of the field.","376":"","377":"Multicarrier dynamics play an essential role in quantum dot photophysics and photochemistry, and they are primarily governed by nonradiative Auger processes. Auger recombination affects the performance of lasers, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, and it has been implicated in fluorescence intermittency phenomena which are relevant in microscopy and biological tagging. Auger cooling is an important mechanism of rapid electron thermalization. Inverse Auger recombination, known as impact ionization, results in carrier multiplication which can enhance the efficiencies of solar cells. This article first reviews the physical picture, theoretical framework and experimental data for Auger processes in bulk crystalline semiconductors. With this context these aspects are then reexamined for nanocrystal quantum dots, and we first consider fundamental features of Auger recombination in these systems. Methods for the chemical control of Auger recombination and Auger cooling are then discussed in the context of how they illuminate the underlying mechanisms, and we also examine the current understanding of carrier multiplication in quantum dots. Manifestations of Auger recombination in quantum dot devices are finally considered, and we conclude the article with a perspective on remaining unknowns in quantum dot multicarrier physics.","378":null,"379":"Protein-protein interactions are vital to biological processes, but the shape and size of their interfaces make them hard to target using small molecules. Cyclic peptides have shown promise as protein-protein interaction modulators, as they can bind protein surfaces with high affinity and specificity. Dozens of cyclic peptides are already FDA approved, and many more are in various stages of development as immunosuppressants, antibiotics, antivirals, or anticancer drugs. However, most cyclic peptide drugs so far have been natural products or derivatives thereof, with de novo design having proven challenging. A key obstacle is structural characterization: cyclic peptides frequently adopt multiple conformations in solution, which are difficult to resolve using techniques like NMR spectroscopy. The lack of solution structural information prevents a thorough understanding of cyclic peptides' sequence-structure-function relationship. Here we review recent development and application of molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling to studying the solution structures of cyclic peptides. We describe novel computational methods capable of sampling cyclic peptides' conformational space and provide examples of computational studies that relate peptides' sequence and structure to biological activity. We demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations have grown from an explanatory technique to a full-fledged tool for systematic studies at the forefront of cyclic peptide therapeutic design.","380":null,"381":null,"382":"Drug resistance is prevalent across many diseases, rendering therapies ineffective with severe financial and health consequences. Rather than accepting resistance after the fact, proactive strategies need to be incorporated into the drug design and development process to minimize the impact of drug resistance. These strategies can be derived from our experience with viral disease targets where multiple generations of drugs had to be developed to combat resistance and avoid antiviral failure. Significant efforts including experimental and computational structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and machine learning have focused on understanding the mechanisms and structural basis of resistance against direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. Integrated methods show promise for being predictive of resistance and potency. In this review, we give an overview of this research for human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, and influenza virus and the lessons learned from resistance mechanisms of DAAs. These lessons translate into rational strategies to avoid resistance in drug design, which can be generalized and applied beyond viral targets. While resistance may not be completely avoidable, rational drug design can and should incorporate strategies at the outset of drug development to decrease the prevalence of drug resistance.","383":"Reactions that occur under physiological conditions find diverse uses in the chemical and biological sciences. However, the limitations that biological systems place on chemical reactions restrict the number of such bioorthogonal reactions. A profound understanding of the mechanistic principles and structure-reactivity trends of these transformations is therefore critical to access new and improved versions of bioorthogonal chemistry. The present article reviews the mechanisms and substituent effects of some of the principal metal-free bioorthogonal reactions based on inverse-electron demand Diels-Alder reactions, 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, and the Staudinger reaction. Mechanisms of modified versions that link these reactions to a dissociative step are further discussed. The presented summary is anticipated to aid the advancement of bioorthogonal chemistry.","384":null,"385":"Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) have historically attracted attention for their unique roles in chemical recycling and self-healing, which are both relevant for sustainable societal development. Efforts in these directions have intensified in the past decade with notable progress in newly discovered dynamic covalent chemistry, fundamental material concepts, and extension toward emerging applications including energy and electronic devices. Beyond that, the values of DCPN in discovering\/designing functional properties not offered by classical thermoplastic and thermoset polymers have recently gained traction. In particular, the dynamic bond exchangeability of DCPN has shown unparalleled design versatility in various areas including shape-shifting materials\/devices, artificial muscles, and microfabrication. Going beyond this basic bond exchangeability, various molecular mechanisms to manipulate network topologies (topological transformation) have led to opportunities to program polymers, with notable concepts such as living networks and topological isomerization. In this review, we provide an overview of the above progress with particular focuses on molecular design strategies for the exploitation of functional material properties. Based on this, we point out the remaining issues and offer perspectives on how this class of materials can shape the future in ways that are complementary with classical thermoplastic and thermoset polymers.","386":"Fluorinated pyrazoles play an important role in medicinal chemistry, drug discovery, agrochemistry, coordination chemistry, and organometallic chemistry. Since the early 1990s, their popularity has grown exponentially. Moreover, more than 50% of all contributions on the topic have been published in the last 5 years. In this review, analysis of novel synthetic approaches to fluorinated pyrazoles that appeared in recent years is performed. A particular emphasis is devoted to a detailed consideration of reaction mechanisms. In addition, the reasons that have led to the ever-increasing popularity of fluorinated pyrazoles in various areas of science are discussed. At the end of the review, several potentially interesting but yet mostly unknown classes of fluorinated pyrazoles are outlined.","387":null,"388":"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with surface ligands that enable their dispersion in solvents. Quantum confinement effects facilitate wave function engineering to sculpt the spatial distribution of charge and spin states and thus the energy and dynamics of QD optical transitions. Colloidal QDs can be integrated in devices using solution-based assembly methods to position single QDs and to create ordered QD arrays. Here, we describe the synthesis, assembly, and photophysical properties of colloidal QDs that have captured scientific imagination and have been harnessed in optical applications. We focus especially on the current understanding of their quantum coherent effects and opportunities to exploit QDs as platforms for quantum information science. Freedom in QD design to isolate and control the quantum mechanical properties of charge, spin, and light presents various approaches to create systems with robust, addressable quantum states. We consider the attributes of QDs for optically addressable qubits in emerging quantum computation, sensing, simulation, and communication technologies, e.g., as robust sources of indistinguishable, single photons that can be integrated into photonic structures to amplify, direct, and tune their emission or as hosts for isolated, coherent spin states that can be coupled to light or to other spins in QD arrays.","389":"Type 1 diabetes therapies that afford tighter glycemic control in a more manageable and painless manner for patients has remained a central focus of next-generation diabetes therapies. In many of these emerging technologies, namely, self-regulated insulin delivery and cell replacement therapies, hydrogels are employed to mitigate some of the most long-standing challenges. In this Review, we summarize recent developments in the use of hydrogels for both insulin delivery and insulin-producing cell therapies for type 1 diabetes management. We first outline perspectives in glucose sensitive hydrogels for smart insulin delivery, pH sensitive polymeric hydrogels for oral insulin delivery, and other physiochemical signals used to trigger insulin release from hydrogels. We, then, investigate the use of hydrogels in the encapsulation of insulin secreting cells with a special emphasis on hydrogels designed to mitigate the foreign body response, provide a suitable extracellular microenvironment, and improve mass transfer through oxygen supplementation and vascularization. Evaluations of limitations and promising directions for future research are also considered. Continuing interdisciplinary and collaborative research efforts will be required to produce hydrogels with instructive biochemical microenvironments necessary to address the enduring challenges of emerging type 1 diabetes therapies.","390":"The tremendous improvement in performance and cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have made them the technology of choice for electrical energy storage. While established battery chemistries and cell architectures for Li-ion batteries achieve good power and energy density, LIBs are unlikely to meet all the performance, cost, and scaling targets required for energy storage, in particular, in large-scale applications such as electrified transportation and grids. The demand to further reduce cost and\/or increase energy density, as well as the growing concern related to natural resource needs for Li-ion have accelerated the investigation of so-called \"beyond Li-ion\" technologies. In this review, we will discuss the recent achievements, challenges, and opportunities of four important \"beyond Li-ion\" technologies: Na-ion batteries, K-ion batteries, all-solid-state batteries, and multivalent batteries. The fundamental science behind the challenges, and potential solutions toward the goals of a low-cost and\/or high-energy-density future, are discussed in detail for each technology. While it is unlikely that any given new technology will fully replace Li-ion in the near future, \"beyond Li-ion\" technologies should be thought of as opportunities for energy storage to grow into mid\/large-scale applications.","391":"Biopolymers are natural polymers sourced from plants and animals, which include a variety of polysaccharides and polypeptides. The inclusion of biopolymers into biomedical hydrogels is of great interest because of their inherent biochemical and biophysical properties, such as cellular adhesion, degradation, and viscoelasticity. The objective of this Review is to provide a detailed overview of the design and development of biopolymer hydrogels for biomedical applications, with an emphasis on biopolymer chemical modifications and cross-linking methods. First, the fundamentals of biopolymers and chemical conjugation methods to introduce cross-linking groups are described. Cross-linking methods to form biopolymer networks are then discussed in detail, including (i) covalent cross-linking (e.g., free radical chain polymerization, click cross-linking, cross-linking due to oxidation of phenolic groups), (ii) dynamic covalent cross-linking (e.g., Schiff base formation, disulfide formation, reversible Diels-Alder reactions), and (iii) physical cross-linking (e.g., guest-host interactions, hydrogen bonding, metal-ligand coordination, grafted biopolymers). Finally, recent advances in the use of chemically modified biopolymer hydrogels for the biofabrication of tissue scaffolds, therapeutic delivery, tissue adhesives and sealants, as well as the formation of interpenetrating network biopolymer hydrogels, are highlighted.","392":"In a generalization of the latest achievements in this field, and as a pattern of massive applications, we present here the Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) and pseudo-JTE (PJTE) as general tools in the study of physical and chemical phenomena related to structural properties of polyatomic systems. We show that the JTE and PJTE are no more specific features of particular (rare) systems (as it was assumed earlier), but virtual properties of all molecular and solid state formations. They occur as a result of vibronic coupling that compensates for the error (inadequacy) introduced in semi-classical definitions of polyatomic configurations by their high-symmetry nuclear positions, thus appending the basic understanding of related phenomena with a new dimension. The implications of the JTE and PJTE in observable properties varies significantly, being especially strong in the states of electronic degeneracy or pseudodegeneracy, but they cannot be a priory fully excluded for any system. After the introductory sections we demonstrate some of the more recent results of the influence of these effects on the observables in physical and chemical phenomena, together with a wide range of applications. The latter are conventionally separated in three parts: intermediate states in chemical and photochemical reactions, manipulation of structural properties of polyatomic systems targeting the JTE and PJTE, and applications in materials science. The illustrative examples include the origin of sudden polarization in photochemical reactions, methods of planarization of puckered (buckled) two-dimensional systems, modification of crystal sublattices by targeting the JTE parameters, the defining role of JTE and PJTE in electronics and spintronics, the origin of ferroelectricity and multiferroicity, as well as a novel property of solids, orientational polarization, and its applications.","393":"Chlorinated solvents were once, and in many places are still, ubiquitous in chemistry laboratories. This review explores the properties that led to such widespread use, why there is now an increasing drive to minimize usage, and what alternatives are currently available.","394":"The unprecedented ability of computations to probe atomic-level details of catalytic systems holds immense promise for the fundamentals-based bottom-up design of novel heterogeneous catalysts, which are at the heart of the chemical and energy sectors of industry. Here, we critically analyze recent advances in computational heterogeneous catalysis. First, we will survey the progress in electronic structure methods and atomistic catalyst models employed, which have enabled the catalysis community to build increasingly intricate, realistic, and accurate models of the active sites of supported transition-metal catalysts. We then review developments in microkinetic modeling, specifically mean-field microkinetic models and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which bridge the gap between nanoscale computational insights and macroscale experimental kinetics data with increasing fidelity. We finally review the advancements in theoretical methods for accelerating catalyst design and discovery. Throughout the review, we provide ample examples of applications, discuss remaining challenges, and provide our outlook for the near future.","395":"The role of X-ray based electron spectroscopies in determining chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of solids has been well-known for several decades. A powerful approach is angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, whereby the kinetic energy and angle of photoelectrons emitted from a sample surface are measured. This provides a direct measurement of the electronic band structure of crystalline solids. Moreover, it yields powerful insights into the electronic interactions at play within a material and into the control of spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, central pillars of future solid state science. With strong recent focus on research of lower-dimensional materials and modified electronic behavior at surfaces and interfaces, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy has become a core technique in the study of quantum materials. In this review, we provide an introduction to the technique. Through examples from several topical materials systems, including topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides, and transition metal oxides, we highlight the types of information which can be obtained. We show how the combination of angle, spin, time, and depth-resolved experiments are able to reveal \"hidden\" spectral features, connected to semiconducting, metallic and magnetic properties of solids, as well as underlining the importance of dimensional effects in quantum materials.","396":"The spectrally narrow, long-lived luminescence of lanthanide ions makes optical nanomaterials based on these elements uniquely attractive from both a fundamental and applicative standpoint. A highly coveted class of such nanomaterials is represented by colloidal lanthanide-doped semiconductor nanocrystals (LnSNCs). Therein, upon proper design, the poor light absorption intrinsically featured by lanthanides is compensated by the semiconductor moiety, which harvests the optical energy and funnel it to the luminescent metal center. Although a great deal of experimental effort has been invested to produce efficient nanomaterials of that sort, relatively modest results have been obtained thus far. As of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals have surged as materials of choice for doping lanthanides, but they have non-negligible shortcomings in terms of chemical stability, toxicity, and light absorption range. The limited gamut of currently available colloidal LnSNCs is unfortunate, given the tremendous technological impact that these nanomaterials could have in fields like biomedicine and optoelectronics. In this review, we provide an overview of the field of colloidal LnSNCs, while distilling the lessons learnt in terms of material design. The result is a compendium of key aspects to consider when devising and synthesizing this class of nanomaterials, with a keen eye on the foreseeable technological scenarios where they are poised to become front runners.","397":"Discoveries in quantum materials, which are characterized by the strongly quantum-mechanical nature of electrons and atoms, have revealed exotic properties that arise from correlations. It is the promise of quantum materials for quantum information science superimposed with the potential of new computational quantum algorithms to discover new quantum materials that inspires this Review. We anticipate that quantum materials to be discovered and developed in the next years will transform the areas of quantum information processing including communication, storage, and computing. Simultaneously, efforts toward developing new quantum algorithmic approaches for quantum simulation and advanced calculation methods for many-body quantum systems enable major advances toward functional quantum materials and their deployment. The advent of quantum computing brings new possibilities for eliminating the exponential complexity that has stymied simulation of correlated quantum systems on high-performance classical computers. Here, we review new algorithms and computational approaches to predict and understand the behavior of correlated quantum matter. The strongly interdisciplinary nature of the topics covered necessitates a common language to integrate ideas from these fields. We aim to provide this common language while weaving together fields across electronic structure theory, quantum electrodynamics, algorithm design, and open quantum systems. Our Review is timely in presenting the state-of-the-art in the field toward algorithms with nonexponential complexity for correlated quantum matter with applications in grand-challenge problems. Looking to the future, at the intersection of quantum information science and algorithms for correlated quantum matter, we envision seminal advances in predicting many-body quantum states and describing excitonic quantum matter and large-scale entangled states, a better understanding of high-temperature superconductivity, and quantifying open quantum system dynamics.","398":"The variety of functionalities and porous structures inherent to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) together with the facile tunability of their properties makes these materials suitable for a wide range of existing and emerging applications. Many of these applications are based on processes involving interaction of MOFs with guest molecules. To optimize a certain process or successfully design a new one, a thorough knowledge is required about the physicochemical characteristics of materials and the mechanisms of their interaction with guest molecules. To obtain such important information, various complementary analytical techniques are applied, among which vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) plays an important role and is indispensable in many cases. In this review, we critically examine the reported applications of IR and Raman spectroscopies as powerful tools for initial characterization of MOF materials and for studying processes of their interaction with various gases. Both the advantages and the limitations of the technique are considered, and the cases where IR or Raman spectroscopy is preferable are highlighted. Peculiarities of MOFs interaction with specific gases and some inconsistent band assignments are also emphasized. Summarizing the broad analytical possibilities of the IR and Raman spectroscopies, we conclude that it can be applied in combinations with other techniques to explicitly establish the structure, properties, and reactivity of MOFs.","399":"Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are an emerging class of mixtures characterized by significant depressions in melting points compared to those of the neat constituent components. These materials are promising for applications as inexpensive \"designer\" solvents exhibiting a host of tunable physicochemical properties. A detailed review of the current literature reveals the lack of predictive understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern the structure-property relationships in this class of solvents. Complex hydrogen bonding is postulated as the root cause of their melting point depressions and physicochemical properties; to understand these hydrogen bonded networks, it is imperative to study these systems as dynamic entities using both simulations and experiments. This review emphasizes recent research efforts in order to elucidate the next steps needed to develop a fundamental framework needed for a deeper understanding of DESs. It covers recent developments in DES research, frames outstanding scientific questions, and identifies promising research thrusts aligned with the advancement of the field toward predictive models and fundamental understanding of these solvents.","400":null,"401":"The properties of transition metal compounds are largely determined by nontrivial interplay of different degrees of freedom: charge, spin, lattice, and also orbital ones. Especially rich and interesting effects occur in systems with orbital degeneracy. For example, they result in the famous Jahn-Teller effect, leading to a plethora of consequences for static and dynamic properties, including nontrivial quantum effects. In the present review, we discuss the main phenomena in the physics of such systems, paying central attention to the novel manifestations of those. After shortly summarizing the basic phenomena and their descriptions, we concentrate on several specific directions in this field. One of them is the reduction of effective dimensionality in many systems with orbital degrees of freedom due to the directional character of orbitals, with the concomitant appearance of some instabilities that lead in particular to the formation of dimers, trimers, and similar clusters in a material. The properties of such cluster systems, which are largely determined by their orbital structure, are discussed in detail, and many specific examples of those in different materials are presented. Another big field that has acquired special significance relatively recently is the role of the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. The mutual influence of this interaction and the more traditional Jahn-Teller physics is treated in detail in the second part of the review. In discussing all of these questions, special attention is paid to novel quantum effects.","402":"The primary goal of this review is to present a clear chemical perspective of borates in order to stimulate and facilitate the discovery of new borate-based optical materials. These materials, which exhibit structures as varied as they are complex, are needed to meet the urgent technological milestones. In the current period of rapid sociotechnological breakthroughs, the need for the rational design and discovery of novel borates with superior performance is greater than ever before. Through the sustained efforts of chemists and material scientists, more than 3900 boron-containing compounds, including borate minerals and synthetic borates, have been documented in the scientific literature. This review provides a survey of all the reported anhydrous borates and an analysis of their complex structural chemistry. State-of-the-art progress related to technological advances in borate-based nonlinear optical, birefringent, and self-frequency-doubling materials is surveyed, with special emphasis on the relationships between structural architectures and optical properties. More importantly, this review serves both as a scientific introduction for graduates and post-doctoral researchers to the chemical richness of solid-state borates and as a comprehensive reference for researchers interested in borate-based optical materials.","403":"The deployment of many-body quantum chemistry methods onto massively parallel high-performance computing (HPC) platforms is reviewed. The particular focus is on highly accurate methods that have become popular in predictive description of chemical phenomena, such as the coupled-cluster method. The account of relevant literature is preceded by a discussion of the modern and near-future HPC landscape and the relevant computational traits of the many-body methods, in their canonical and reduced-scaling formulations, that underlie the challenges in their HPC realization.","404":"Following a strong regain of interest over the past 20 years in the chemistry of allenes, this \"forgotten\" family of unsaturated molecules is undergoing a renaissance. In this context, the metal-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of allenes is nowadays one of the most studied transformations. The latter is of great interest because it opens a way to produce selectively functionalized allylic structures. These motifs are important in synthesis, particularly for the formation of asymmetric centers. Hydrofunctionalization of allenes is also a totally atom economical strategy, avoiding generation of any waste, to produce allylic functionalized structures. Compared to the main pathway to obtain the latter (aka Tsuji-Trost allylic substitution), metal-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization does not require the prefunctionalization of starting material with a leaving group. This review presents a state of the art exploration of all existing transition metal-catalyzed methods allowing the selective intermolecular hydrofunctionalization of allenes with N-H, C-H, and O-H nucleophiles or electrophiles.","405":"Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has emerged as a versatile tool for studies of interfaces in biology and materials science with notable utility in biophysical and electrochemical measurements. The heart of the SICM is a nanometer-scale electrolyte filled glass pipette that serves as a scanning probe. In the initial conception, manipulations of ion currents through the tip of the pipette and appropriate positioning hardware provided a route to recording micro- and nanoscopic mapping of the topography of surfaces. Subsequent advances in instrumentation, probe design, and methods significantly increased opportunities for SICM beyond recording topography. Hybridization of SICM with coincident characterization techniques such as optical microscopy and faradaic electrodes have brought SICM to the forefront as a tool for nanoscale chemical measurement for a wide range of applications. Modern approaches to SICM realize an important tool in analytical, bioanalytical, biophysical, and materials measurements, where significant opportunities remain for further exploration. In this review, we chronicle the development of SICM from the perspective of both the development of instrumentation and methods and the breadth of measurements performed.","406":"This is a Review of recent studies on surface structures of crystalline materials in the presence of gases in the mTorr to atmospheric pressure range, which brings surface science into a brand new direction. Surface structure is not only a property of the material but also depends on the environment surrounding it. This Review emphasizes that high\/ambient pressure goes hand-in-hand with ambient temperature, because weakly interacting species can be densely covering surfaces at room temperature only when in equilibrium with a sufficiently high gas pressure. At the same time, ambient temperatures help overcome activation barriers that impede diffusion and reactions. Even species with weak binding energy can have residence lifetimes on the surface that allow them to trigger reconstructions of the atomic structure. The consequences of this are far from trivial because under ambient conditions the structure of the surface dynamically adapts to its environment and as a result completely new structures are often formed. This new era of surface science emerged and spread rapidly after the retooling of characterization techniques that happened in the last two decades. This Review is focused on the new surface structures enabled particularly by one of the new tools: high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We will cover several important surfaces that have been intensely scrutinized, including transition metals, oxides, and alloys.","407":"Noble-metal nanoframes consisting of interconnected, ultrathin ridges have received considerable attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The enthusiasm arises from the high utilization efficiency of atoms for significantly reducing the material loading while enhancing the catalytic performance. In this review article, we offer a comprehensive assessment of research endeavors in the design and rational synthesis of noble-metal nanoframes for applications in catalysis. We start with a brief introduction to the unique characteristics of nanoframes, followed by a discussion of the synthetic strategies and their controls in terms of structure and composition. We then present case studies to elucidate mechanistic details behind the synthesis of mono-, bi-, and multimetallic nanoframes, as well as heterostructured and hybrid systems. We discuss their performance in electrocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and photocatalysis. Finally, we highlight recent progress in addressing the structural and compositional stability issues of nanoframes for the assurance of robustness in catalytic applications.","408":"Synergistic catalysis, a type of plural catalysis which utilizes at least two different catalysts to enable a reaction between two separately activated substrates, has unlocked a plethora of previously unattainable transformations and novel chemical reactivity. Despite the appreciable utility of synergistic catalysis, specific examples involving two transition metals have been limited, as ensuring a judicious choice of reaction parameters to prevent deactivation of catalysts, undesirable monocatalytic event(s) leading to side products, or premature termination and other potentially troublesome outcomes present a formidable challenge. Excluding those driven by photocatalytic mechanisms, this review will highlight the reported examples of reactions that make use of two simultaneous catalytic cycles driven by two transition metal catalysts.","409":"Click and bio-orthogonal reactions are dominated by cycloaddition reactions in general and 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions in particular. Among the dipoles routinely used for click chemistry, azides, nitrones, isonitriles, and nitrile oxides are the most popular. This review is focused on the emerging click chemistry that uses mesoionic compounds as dipole partners. Mesoionics are a very old family of molecules, but their use as reactants for click and bio-orthogonal chemistry is quite recent. The facility to derivatize these dipoles and to tune their reactivity toward cycloaddition reactions makes mesoionics an attractive opportunity for future click chemistry development. In addition, some compounds from this family are able to undergo click-and-release reactions, finding interesting applications in cells, as well as in animals. This review covers the synthetic access to main mesoionics, their reaction with dipolarophiles, and recent applications in chemical biology and heterocycle synthesis.","410":"Compartmentalization of the aqueous space within a cell is necessary for life. In similar fashion to the nanometer-scale compartments in living systems, synthetic water-soluble coordination cages (WSCCs) can isolate guest molecules and host chemical transformations. Such cages thus show promise in biological, medical, environmental, and industrial domains. This review highlights examples of three-dimensional synthetic WSCCs, offering perspectives so as to enhance their design and applications. Strategies are presented that address key challenges for the preparation of coordination cages that are soluble and stable in water. The peculiarities of guest binding in aqueous media are examined, highlighting amplified binding in water, changing guest properties, and the recognition of specific molecular targets. The properties of WSCC hosts associated with biomedical applications, and their use as vessels to carry out chemical reactions in water, are also presented. These examples sketch a blueprint for the preparation of new metal-organic containers for use in aqueous solution, as well as guidelines for the engineering of new applications in water.","411":"Nucleosides play central roles in all facets of life, from metabolism to cellular signaling. Because of their physiochemical properties, nucleosides are lipid bilayer impermeable and thus rely on dedicated transport systems to cross biological membranes. In humans, two unrelated protein families mediate nucleoside membrane transport: the concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside transporter families. The objective of this review is to provide a broad outlook on the current status of nucleoside transport research. We will discuss the role played by nucleoside transporters in human health and disease, with emphasis placed on recent structural advancements that have revealed detailed molecular principles of these important cellular transport systems and exploitable pharmacological features.","412":"In light of the 60-year anniversary of the publishing of \"Clathrate Solutions\" by van der Waals and Platteeuw in 2019, we present a critical review of the famed solid solution model first disclosed in 1959. First, we lay out the groundwork in the 1950s aimed at the development of a phenomenological approach to clathrate modeling. Then we review the statistical thermodynamics fundamentals of the model, considering van der Waals and Platteeuw's earlier works, to obtain a consistent interpretation of the model. We turn our focus to clathrate hydrates and discuss the major contributions that led to the current state-of-the-art of gas hydrate thermodynamic modeling. Finally, we present some of the areas in clathrate thermodynamics that we foresee as the new frontiers in this subject. We expect this review to help newcomers to clathrate science in elucidating some subtle aspects of the model and to intrigue clathrate experts with a fresh look on this well-established solid solution model.","413":null,"414":"Short peptides are ubiquitous in nature. They are found as hormones, pheromones, antibacterial and antifungal agents in innate immunity systems, toxins, and pesticides. But no one seriously considered that peptides could be useful as scaffold hydrogel materials. There has been a significant change since 1990 after the discovery of an ionic self-complementary peptide as a very interesting repeating segment in a yeast protein. It is now recognized that self-assembling peptides made from 20 natural amino acids have real material properties. Currently, many diverse applications have been developed from these simple and designer self-assembling peptide scaffold hydrogels and are commercially available. Examples include: (1) real 3D tissue cell cultures of diverse tissue cells and various stem cells, (2) reparative and regenerative medicine as well as tissue engineering, (3) 3D tissue printing, (4) sustained releases of small molecules, growth factors, and monoclonal antibodies, and (5) accelerated wound healings of skin and diabetic ulcers as well as instant hemostatic applications in surgery. Self-assembling peptide nanobiotechnology will likely continue to expand in many directions in the coming years.","415":"Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria are a global threat with many common infections becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate. While significant effort has gone into the development of potent biocides, the effectiveness of many first-line antibiotics has been diminished due to adaptive resistance mechanisms. Bacterial membrane proteins belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily play significant roles in mediating bacterial resistance to antimicrobials. They participate in multidrug efflux and cell wall biogenesis to transform bacterial pathogens into \"superbugs\" that are resistant even to last resort antibiotics. In this review, we summarize the RND superfamily of efflux transporters with a primary focus on the assembly and function of the inner membrane pumps. These pumps are critical for extrusion of antibiotics from the cell as well as the transport of lipid moieties to the outer membrane to establish membrane rigidity and stability. We analyze recently solved structures of bacterial inner membrane efflux pumps as to how they bind and transport their substrates. Our cumulative data indicate that these RND membrane proteins are able to utilize different oligomerization states to achieve particular activities, including forming MDR pumps and cell wall remodeling machineries, to ensure bacterial survival. This mechanistic insight, combined with simulated docking techniques, allows for the design and optimization of new efflux pump inhibitors to more effectively treat infections that today are difficult or impossible to cure.","416":"Our understanding of lipid peroxidation in biology and medicine is rapidly evolving, as it is increasingly implicated in various diseases but also recognized as a key part of normal cell function, signaling, and death (ferroptosis). Not surprisingly, the root and consequences of lipid peroxidation have garnered increasing attention from multiple disciplines in recent years. Here we \"connect the dots\" between the fundamental chemistry underpinning the cascade reactions of lipid peroxidation (enzymatic or free radical), the reactive nature of the products formed (lipid-derived electrophiles), and the biological targets and mechanisms associated with these products that culminate in cellular responses. We additionally bring light to the use of highly sensitive, fluorescence-based methodologies. Stemming from the foundational concepts in chemistry and biology, these methodologies enable visualizing and quantifying each reaction in the cascade in a cellular and ultimately tissue context, toward deciphering the connections between the chemistry and physiology of lipid peroxidation. The review offers a platform in which the chemistry and biomedical research communities can access a comprehensive summary of fundamental concepts regarding lipid peroxidation, experimental tools for the study of such processes, as well as the recent discoveries by leading investigators with an emphasis on significant open questions.","417":"Electronically excited states of molecules are at the heart of photochemistry, photophysics, as well as photobiology and also play a role in material science. Their theoretical description requires highly accurate quantum chemical calculations, which are computationally expensive. In this review, we focus on not only how machine learning is employed to speed up such excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects. Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra, as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide a short introduction into excited-state electronic structure methods and approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and describe tricks and problems when using them in machine learning for excited states of molecules.","418":null,"419":"The liver is beyond any doubt the most important metabolic organ of the human body. This function requires an intensive crosstalk within liver cellular structures, but also with other organs. Membrane transport proteins are therefore of upmost importance as they represent the sensors and mediators that shuttle signals from outside to the inside of liver cells and\/or vice versa. In this review, we summarize the known literature of liver transport proteins with a clear emphasis on functional and structural information on ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are expressed in the human liver. These primary active membrane transporters form one of the largest families of membrane proteins. In the liver, they play an essential role in for example bile formation or xenobiotic export. Our review provides a state of the art and comprehensive summary of the current knowledge of hepatobiliary ABC transporters. Clearly, our knowledge has improved with a breath-taking speed over the last few years and will expand further. Thus, this review will provide the status quo and will lay the foundation for new and exciting avenues in liver membrane transporter research.","420":"Decarboxylative halogenation, or halodecarboxylation, represents one of the fundamental key methods for the synthesis of ubiquitous organic halides. The method is based on conversion of carboxylic acids to the corresponding organic halides via selective cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond between the skeleton of the molecule and the carboxylic group and the liberation of carbon dioxide. In this review, we discuss and analyze major approaches for the conversion of alkanoic, alkenoic, acetylenic, and (hetero)aromatic acids to the corresponding alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and (hetero)aryl halides. These methods include the preparation of families of valuable organic iodides, bromides, chlorides, and fluorides. The historic and modern methods for halodecarboxylation reactions are broadly discussed, including analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. We critically address the features, reaction selectivity, substrate scopes, and limitations of the approaches. In the available cases, mechanistic details of the reactions are presented, and the generality and uniqueness of the different mechanistic pathways are highlighted. The challenges, opportunities, and future directions in the field of decarboxylative halogenation are provided.","421":null,"422":"High-energy rechargeable lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with Li metal anode (LMA) were first developed in the 1970s, but their practical applications have been hindered by the safety and low-efficiency concerns related to LMA. Recently, a worldwide effort on LMA-based rechargeable LMBs has been revived to replace graphite-based, Li-ion batteries because of the much higher energy density that can be achieved with LMBs. This review focuses on the recent progress on the stabilization of LMA with nonaqueous electrolytes and reveals the fundamental mechanisms behind this improved stability. Various strategies that can enhance the stability of LMA in practical conditions and perspectives on the future development of LMA are also discussed. These strategies include the use of novel electrolytes such as superconcentrated electrolytes, localized high-concentration electrolytes, and highly fluorinated electrolytes, surface coatings that can form a solid electrolyte interphase with a high interfacial energy and self-healing capabilities, development of \"anode-free\" Li batteries to minimize the interaction between LMA and electrolyte, approaches to enable operation of LMA in practical conditions, etc. Combination of these strategies ultimately will lead us closer to the large-scale application of LMBs which often is called the \"Holy Grail\" of energy storage systems.","423":"","424":"The biology of mycobacteria is dominated by a complex cell envelope of unique composition and structure and of exceptionally low permeability. This cell envelope is the basis of many of the pathogenic features of mycobacteria and the site of susceptibility and resistance to many antibiotics and host defense mechanisms. This review is focused on the transporters that assemble and functionalize this complex structure. It highlights both the progress and the limits of our understanding of how (lipo)polysaccharides, (glyco)lipids, and other bacterial secretion products are translocated across the different layers of the cell envelope to their final extra-cytoplasmic location. It further describes some of the unique strategies evolved by mycobacteria to import nutrients and other products through this highly impermeable barrier.","425":"During the last three decades, a series of key technological improvements turned atomic force microscopy (AFM) into a nanoscopic laboratory to directly observe and chemically characterize molecular and cell biological systems under physiological conditions. Here, we review key technological improvements that have established AFM as an analytical tool to observe and quantify native biological systems from the micro- to the nanoscale. Native biological systems include living tissues, cells, and cellular components such as single or complexed proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, or sugars. We showcase the procedures to customize nanoscopic chemical laboratories by functionalizing AFM tips and outline the advantages and limitations in applying different AFM modes to chemically image, sense, and manipulate biosystems at (sub)nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution. We further discuss theoretical approaches to extract the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of specific biomolecular interactions detected by AFM for single bonds and extend the discussion to multiple bonds. Finally, we highlight the potential of combining AFM with optical microscopy and spectroscopy to address the full complexity of biological systems and to tackle fundamental challenges in life sciences.","426":"A broad range of approaches to many-body dispersion are discussed, including empirical approaches with multiple fitted parameters, augmented density functional-based approaches, symmetry adapted perturbation theory, and a supermolecule approach based on coupled cluster theory. Differing definitions of \"body\" are considered, specifically atom-based vs molecule-based approaches.","427":"Skyrmion, a concept originally proposed in particle physics half a century ago, can now find the most fertile field for its applicability, that is, the magnetic skyrmion realized in helimagnetic materials. The spin swirling vortex-like texture of the magnetic skyrmion can define the particle nature by topology; that is, all the constituent spin moments within the two-dimensional sheet wrap the sphere just one time. Such a topological nature of the magnetic skyrmion can lead to extraordinary metastability via topological protection and the driven motion with low electric-current excitation, which may promise future application to spintronics. The skyrmions in the magnetic materials frequently show up as the crystal lattice form, e.g., hexagonal lattice, but sometimes as isolated or independent particles. These skyrmions in magnets were initially found in acentric magnets, such as chiral, polar, and bilayered magnets endowed with antisymmetric spin exchange interaction, while the skyrmion host materials have been explored in a broader family of compounds including centrosymmetric magnets. This review describes the materials science and materials chemistry of magnetic skyrmions using the classification scheme of the skyrmion forming microscopic mechanisms. The emergent phenomena and functions mediated by skyrmions are described, including the generation of emergent magnetic and electric field by statics and dynamics of skrymions and the inherent magnetoelectric effect. The other important magnetic topological defects in two or three dimensions, such as biskyrmions, antiskyrmions, merons, and hedgehogs, are also reviewed in light of their interplay with the skyrmions.","428":"The renowned yellow phosphor yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) doped with trivalent cerium has found its way into applications in many forms: as powder of micron sized crystals, as a ceramic, and even as a single crystal. However, additional technological advancement requires providing this material in new form factors, especially in terms of particle size. Where many materials have been developed on the nanoscale with excellent optical properties (e.g., semiconductor quantum dots, perovskite nanocrystals, and rare earth doped phosphors), it is surprising that the development of nanocrystalline YAG:Ce is not as mature as for these other materials. Control over size and shape is still in its infancy, and optical properties are not yet at the same level as other materials on the nanoscale, even though YAG:Ce microcrystalline materials exceed the performance of most other materials. This review highlights developments in synthesis methods and mechanisms and gives an overview of the state of the art morphologies, particle sizes, and optical properties of YAG:Ce on the nanoscale.","429":"The crisis of antibiotic resistance necessitates creative and innovative approaches, from chemical identification and analysis to the assessment of bioactivity. Plant natural products (NPs) represent a promising source of antibacterial lead compounds that could help fill the drug discovery pipeline in response to the growing antibiotic resistance crisis. The major strength of plant NPs lies in their rich and unique chemodiversity, their worldwide distribution and ease of access, their various antibacterial modes of action, and the proven clinical effectiveness of plant extracts from which they are isolated. While many studies have tried to summarize NPs with antibacterial activities, a comprehensive review with rigorous selection criteria has never been performed. In this work, the literature from 2012 to 2019 was systematically reviewed to highlight plant-derived compounds with antibacterial activity by focusing on their growth inhibitory activity. A total of 459 compounds are included in this Review, of which 50.8% are phenolic derivatives, 26.6% are terpenoids, 5.7% are alkaloids, and 17% are classified as other metabolites. A selection of 183 compounds is further discussed regarding their antibacterial activity, biosynthesis, structure-activity relationship, mechanism of action, and potential as antibiotics. Emerging trends in the field of antibacterial drug discovery from plants are also discussed. This Review brings to the forefront key findings on the antibacterial potential of plant NPs for consideration in future antibiotic discovery and development efforts.","430":"Quantum spin liquids are an exciting playground for exotic physical phenomena and emergent many-body quantum states. The realization and discovery of quantum spin liquid candidate materials and associated phenomena lie at the intersection of solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science and engineering. In this review, we provide the current status of the crystal chemistry, synthetic techniques, physical properties, and research methods in the field of quantum spin liquids. We highlight a number of specific quantum spin liquid candidate materials and their structure-property relationships, elucidating their fascinating behavior and connecting it to the intricacies of their structures. Furthermore, we share our thoughts on defects and their inevitable presence in materials, of which quantum spin liquids are no exception, which can complicate the interpretation of characterization of these materials, and urge the community to extend their attention to materials preparation and data analysis, cognizant of the impact of defects. This review was written with the intention of providing guidance on improving the materials design and growth of quantum spin liquids, and to paint a picture of the beauty of the underlying chemistry of this exciting class of materials.","431":"Drug resistance has profoundly limited the success of cancer treatment, driving relapse, metastasis, and mortality. Nearly all anticancer drugs and even novel immunotherapies, which recalibrate the immune system for tumor recognition and destruction, have succumbed to resistance development. Engineers have emerged across mechanical, physical, chemical, mathematical, and biological disciplines to address the challenge of drug resistance using a combination of interdisciplinary tools and skill sets. This review explores the developing, complex, and under-recognized role of engineering in medicine to address the multitude of challenges in cancer drug resistance. Looking through the \"lens\" of intrinsic, extrinsic, and drug-induced resistance (also referred to as \"tolerance\"), we will discuss three specific areas where active innovation is driving novel treatment paradigms: (1) nanotechnology, which has revolutionized drug delivery in desmoplastic tissues, harnessing physiochemical characteristics to destroy tumors through photothermal therapy and rationally designed nanostructures to circumvent cancer immunotherapy failures, (2) bioengineered tumor models, which have benefitted from microfluidics and mechanical engineering, creating a paradigm shift in physiologically relevant environments to predict clinical refractoriness and enabling platforms for screening drug combinations to thwart resistance at the individual patient level, and (3) computational and mathematical modeling, which blends in silico simulations with molecular and evolutionary principles to map mutational patterns and model interactions between cells that promote resistance. On the basis that engineering in medicine has resulted in discoveries in resistance biology and successfully translated to clinical strategies that improve outcomes, we suggest the proliferation of multidisciplinary science that embraces engineering.","432":null,"433":"Topology, a mathematical concept, has recently become a popular and truly transdisciplinary topic encompassing condensed matter physics, solid state chemistry, and materials science. Since there is a direct connection between real space, namely atoms, valence electrons, bonds, and orbitals, and reciprocal space, namely bands and Fermi surfaces, via symmetry and topology, classifying topological materials within a single-particle picture is possible. Currently, most materials are classified as trivial insulators, semimetals, and metals or as topological insulators, Dirac and Weyl nodal-line semimetals, and topological metals. The key ingredients for topology are certain symmetries, the inert pair effect of the outer electrons leading to inversion of the conduction and valence bands, and spin-orbit coupling. This review presents the topological concepts related to solids from the viewpoint of a solid-state chemist, summarizes techniques for growing single crystals, and describes basic physical property measurement techniques to characterize topological materials beyond their structure and provide examples of such materials. Finally, a brief outlook on the impact of topology in other areas of chemistry is provided at the end of the article.","434":"This is the first comprehensive review on methods and materials for use in optical sensing of pH values and on applications of such sensors. The Review starts with an introduction that contains subsections on the definition of the pH value, a brief look back on optical methods for sensing of pH, on the effects of ionic strength on pH values and pKa values, on the selectivity, sensitivity, precision, dynamic ranges, and temperature dependence of such sensors. Commonly used optical sensing schemes are covered in a next main chapter, with subsections on methods based on absorptiometry, reflectometry, luminescence, refractive index, surface plasmon resonance, photonic crystals, turbidity, mechanical displacement, interferometry, and solvatochromism. This is followed by sections on absorptiometric and luminescent molecular probes for use pH in sensors. Further large sections cover polymeric hosts and supports, and methods for immobilization of indicator dyes. Further and more specific sections summarize the state of the art in materials with dual functionality (indicator and host), nanomaterials, sensors based on upconversion and 2-photon absorption, multiparameter sensors, imaging, and sensors for extreme pH values. A chapter on the many sensing formats has subsections on planar, fiber optic, evanescent wave, refractive index, surface plasmon resonance and holography based sensor designs, and on distributed sensing. Another section summarizes selected applications in areas, such as medicine, biology, oceanography, bioprocess monitoring, corrosion studies, on the use of pH sensors as transducers in biosensors and chemical sensors, and their integration into flow-injection analyzers, microfluidic devices, and lab-on-a-chip systems. An extra section is devoted to current challenges, with subsections on challenges of general nature and those of specific nature. A concluding section gives an outlook on potential future trends and perspectives.","435":"Electrocatalysts with single metal atoms as active sites have received increasing attention owing to their high atomic utilization efficiency and exotic catalytic activity and selectivity. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the recent development of such single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) for various energy-conversion reactions. The discussion starts with an introduction of the different types of SAECs, followed by an overview of the synthetic methodologies to control the atomic dispersion of metal sites and atomically resolved characterization using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In recognition of the extensive applications of SAECs, the electrocatalytic studies are dissected in terms of various important electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Examples of SAECs are deliberated in each case in terms of their catalytic performance, structure-property relationships, and catalytic enhancement mechanisms. A perspective is provided at the end of each section about remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of SAECs for the targeted reaction.","436":"Three- and four-membered rings, widespread motifs in nature and medicinal chemistry, have fascinated chemists ever since their discovery. However, due to energetic considerations, small rings are often difficult to assemble. In this regard, homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct these highly strained carbocycles. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of all the major advances and discoveries made in the gold-catalyzed synthesis of cyclopropanes, cyclopropenes, cyclobutanes, cyclobutenes, and their corresponding heterocyclic or heterosubstituted analogs.","437":"Photoactivatable (alternatively, photoremovable, photoreleasable, or photocleavable) protecting groups (PPGs), also known as caged or photocaged compounds, are used to enable non-invasive spatiotemporal photochemical control over the release of species of interest. Recent years have seen the development of PPGs activatable by biologically and chemically benign visible and near-infrared (NIR) light. These long-wavelength-absorbing moieties expand the applicability of this powerful method and its accessibility to non-specialist users. This review comprehensively covers organic and transition metal-containing photoactivatable compounds (complexes) that absorb in the visible- and NIR-range to release various leaving groups and gasotransmitters (carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen sulfide). The text also covers visible- and NIR-light-induced photosensitized release using molecular sensitizers, quantum dots, and upconversion and second-harmonic nanoparticles, as well as release via photodynamic (photooxygenation by singlet oxygen) and photothermal effects. Release from photoactivatable polymers, micelles, vesicles, and photoswitches, along with the related emerging field of photopharmacology, is discussed at the end of the review.","438":"Research on heterogeneous single-atom catalysts (SACs) has become an emerging frontier in catalysis science because of their advantages in high utilization of noble metals, precisely identified active sites, high selectivity, and tunable activity. Graphene, as a one-atom-thick two-dimensional carbon material with unique structural and electronic properties, has been reported to be a superb support for SACs. Herein, we provide an overview of recent progress in investigations of graphene-based SACs. Among the large number of publications, we will selectively focus on the stability of metal single-atoms (SAs) anchored on different sites of graphene support and the catalytic performances of graphene-based SACs for different chemical reactions, including thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis. We will summarize the fundamental understandings on the electronic structures and their intrinsic connection with catalytic properties of graphene-based SACs, and also provide a brief perspective on the future design of efficient SACs with graphene and graphene-like materials.","439":"Metal atoms dispersed on the oxide supports constitute a large category of single-atom catalysts. In this review, oxide supported single-atom catalysts are discussed about their synthetic procedures, characterizations, and reaction mechanism in thermocatalysis, such as water-gas shift reaction, selective oxidation\/hydrogenation, and coupling reactions. Some typical oxide materials, including ferric oxide, cerium oxide, titanium dioxide, aluminum oxide, and so on, are intentionally mentioned for the unique roles as supports in anchoring metal atoms and taking part in the catalytic reactions. The interactions between metal atoms and oxide supports are summarized to give a picture on how to stabilize the atomic metal centers, and rationally tune the geometric structures and electronic states of single atoms. Furthermore, several directions in fabricating single-atom catalysts with improved performance are proposed on the basis of state-of-the-art understanding in metal-oxide interactions.","440":"When metals in supported catalysts are atomically dispersed, they are usually cationic and bonded chemically to supports. Investigations of noble metals in this class are growing rapidly, leading to discoveries of catalysts with new properties. Characterization of these materials is challenging because the metal atoms reside on surfaces that are typically nonuniform in composition and structure. We posit that understanding of structures and catalytic properties of these materials is emerging most strongly from investigations of structurally uniform catalysts (metal atoms dispersed on crystalline supports) which can be characterized incisively with atomic-resolution electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy, bolstered by density functional theory. We assess the literature of such catalysts supported on zeotype materials, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks. Assessing characterization, reactivity, and catalytic performance of catalysts for oxidation, hydrogenation, the water-gas shift reaction, and others, we consider metal-support interactions and ligand effects for various metal-support combinations, evaluating the degree of structural uniformity of exemplary catalysts and summarizing structure-reactivity and structure-catalytic property relationships.","441":null,"442":"As we begin to reach the limits of classical computing, quantum computing has emerged as a technology that has captured the imagination of the scientific world. While for many years, the ability to execute quantum algorithms was only a theoretical possibility, recent advances in hardware mean that quantum computing devices now exist that can carry out quantum computation on a limited scale. Thus, it is now a real possibility, and of central importance at this time, to assess the potential impact of quantum computers on real problems of interest. One of the earliest and most compelling applications for quantum computers is Feynman's idea of simulating quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. Such systems are found across chemistry, physics, and materials science. The particular way in which quantum computing extends classical computing means that one cannot expect arbitrary simulations to be sped up by a quantum computer, thus one must carefully identify areas where quantum advantage may be achieved. In this review, we briefly describe central problems in chemistry and materials science, in areas of electronic structure, quantum statistical mechanics, and quantum dynamics that are of potential interest for solution on a quantum computer. We then take a detailed snapshot of current progress in quantum algorithms for ground-state, dynamics, and thermal-state simulation and analyze their strengths and weaknesses for future developments.","443":"Nature is full of examples of symbiotic relationships. The critical symbiotic relation between host and mutualistic bacteria is attracting increasing attention to the degree that the gut microbiome is proposed by some as a new organ system. The microbiome exerts its systemic effect through a diverse range of metabolites, which include gaseous molecules such as H2, CO2, NH3, CH4, NO, H2S, and CO. In turn, the human host can influence the microbiome through these gaseous molecules as well in a reciprocal manner. Among these gaseous molecules, NO, H2S, and CO occupy a special place because of their widely known physiological functions in the host and their overlap and similarity in both targets and functions. The roles that NO and H2S play have been extensively examined by others. Herein, the roles of CO in host-gut microbiome communication are examined through a discussion of (1) host production and function of CO, (2) available CO donors as research tools, (3) CO production from diet and bacterial sources, (4) effect of CO on bacteria including CO sensing, and (5) gut microbiome production of CO. There is a large amount of literature suggesting the \"messenger\" role of CO in host-gut microbiome communication. However, much more work is needed to begin achieving a systematic understanding of this issue.","444":"Isolated atoms featuring unique reactivity are at the heart of enzymatic and homogeneous catalysts. In contrast, although the concept has long existed, single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) have only recently gained prominence. Host materials have similar functions to ligands in homogeneous catalysts, determining the stability, local environment, and electronic properties of isolated atoms and thus providing a platform for tailoring heterogeneous catalysts for targeted applications. Within just a decade, we have witnessed many examples of SACs both disrupting diverse fields of heterogeneous catalysis with their distinctive reactivity and substantially enriching our understanding of molecular processes on surfaces. To date, the term SAC mostly refers to late transition metal-based systems, but numerous examples exist in which isolated atoms of other elements play key catalytic roles. This review provides a compositional encyclopedia of SACs, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the introduction of this term. By defining single-atom catalysis in the broadest sense, we explore the full elemental diversity, joining different areas across the whole periodic table, and discussing historical milestones and recent developments. In particular, we examine the coordination structures and associated properties accessed through distinct single-atom-host combinations and relate them to their main applications in thermo-, electro-, and photocatalysis, revealing trends in element-specific evolution, host design, and uses. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, including multimetallic SACs, atom proximity control, and possible applications for multistep and cascade reactions, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this flourishing field.","445":null,"446":"Since the prediction of the existence of metallabenzenes in 1979, metallaaromatic chemistry has developed rapidly, due to its importance in both experimental and theoretical fields. Now six major types of metallaromatic compounds, metallabenzenes, metallabenzynes, heterometallaaromatics, dianion metalloles, metallapentalenes and metallapentalynes (also termed carbolongs), and spiro metalloles, have been reported and extensively studied. Their parent organic analogues may be aromatic, non-aromatic, or even anti-aromatic. These unique systems not only enrich the large family of aromatics, but they also broaden our understanding and extend the concept of aromaticity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of metallaaromatic chemistry. We have focused on not only the six major classes of metallaaromatics, including the main-group-metal-based metallaaromatics, but also other types, such as metallacyclobutadienes and metallacyclopropenes. The structures, synthetic methods, and reactivities are described, their applications are covered, and the challenges and future prospects of the area are discussed. The criteria commonly used to judge the aromaticity of metallaaromatics are presented.","447":"Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) emerge as a promising material to advance carbon nanoelectronics. However, synthesizing or assembling pure metallic\/semiconducting SWNTs required for interconnects\/integrated circuits, respectively, by a conventional chemical vapor deposition method or by an assembly technique remains challenging. Recent studies have shown significant scientific breakthroughs in controlled SWNT synthesis\/assembly and applications in scaled field effect transistors, which are a critical component in functional nanodevices, thereby rendering the horizontal SWNT array an important candidate for innovating nanotechnology. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the controlled synthesis, surface assembly, characterization techniques, and potential applications of horizontally aligned SWNT arrays. This review begins with the discussion of synthesis of horizontally aligned SWNTs with regulated direction, density, structure, and theoretical models applied to understand the growth results. Several traditional procedures applied for assembling SWNTs on target surface are also briefly discussed. It then discusses the techniques adopted to characterize SWNTs, ranging from electron\/probe microscopy to various optical spectroscopy methods. Prototype applications based on the horizontally aligned SWNTs, such as interconnects, field effect transistors, integrated circuits, and even computers, are subsequently described. Finally, this review concludes with challenges and a brief outlook of the future development in this research field.","448":"During the last two decades, engineering motion with small-scale matter has received much attention in several areas of research, ranging from supramolecular chemistry and colloidal science to robotics and automation. The numerous discoveries and innovative concepts realized in motile micro- and nanostructures have converged in the field of small-scale swimmers. These man-made micro- and nanomachines can move in fluids by transforming different forms of energy to mechanical motion. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are crystalline coordination polymers with high porosity, have been proposed as key building blocks in several small-scale swimmer designs. These materials possess the required features for motile micro- and nanodevices, such as high cargo-loading capacity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and stimuli-responsiveness. In this review, we take a journey through the major breakthroughs and milestones realized in the area of MOF-based small-scale swimmers. First, a brief introduction to the field of small-scale swimmers is provided. Next, we review different strategies that have been reported for imparting motion to MOFs. Finally, we emphasize the incorporation of molecular machines into the MOF's architecture as the means to create highly integrated small-scale swimmers. The strategies and developments explored in this review pave the way toward the use of motile MOFs for a variety of applications in the fields of biomedicine, environmental remediation, and on-the-fly chemistry.","449":"","450":"Bioelectrocatalysis is an interdisciplinary research field combining biocatalysis and electrocatalysis via the utilization of materials derived from biological systems as catalysts to catalyze the redox reactions occurring at an electrode. Bioelectrocatalysis synergistically couples the merits of both biocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The advantages of biocatalysis include high activity, high selectivity, wide substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions. The advantages of electrocatalysis include the possible utilization of renewable electricity as an electron source and high energy conversion efficiency. These properties are integrated to achieve selective biosensing, efficient energy conversion, and the production of diverse products. This review seeks to systematically and comprehensively detail the fundamentals, analyze the existing problems, summarize the development status and applications, and look toward the future development directions of bioelectrocatalysis. First, the structure, function, and modification of bioelectrocatalysts are discussed. Second, the essentials of bioelectrocatalytic systems, including electron transfer mechanisms, electrode materials, and reaction medium, are described. Third, the application of bioelectrocatalysis in the fields of biosensors, fuel cells, solar cells, catalytic mechanism studies, and bioelectrosyntheses of high-value chemicals are systematically summarized. Finally, future developments and a perspective on bioelectrocatalysis are suggested.","451":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed from organic linkers and inorganic building blocks, are well-known for their high crystallinity, high surface areas, and high component tunability. The stability of MOFs is a key prerequisite for their potential practical applications in areas including storage, separation, catalysis, and biomedicine since it is essential to guarantee the framework integrity during utilization. However, MOFs are prone to destruction under external stimuli, considerably hampering their commercialization. In this Review, we provide an overview of the situations where MOFs undergo destruction due to external stimuli such as chemical, thermal, photolytic, radiolytic, electronic, and mechanical factors and offer guidelines to avoid unwanted degradation happened to the framework. Furthermore, we discuss possible destruction mechanisms and their varying derived products. In particular, we highlight cases that utilize MOF instability to fabricate varying materials including hierarchically porous MOFs, monolayer MOF nanosheets, amorphous MOF liquids and glasses, polymers, metal nanoparticles, metal carbide nanoparticles, and carbon materials. Finally, we provide a perspective on the utilization of MOF destruction to develop advanced materials with a superior hierarchy for various applications.","452":"Nitriles are ubiquitous versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. Common reactions of nitriles include the transformation of cyano groups into carbonyl and amine moieties. The functionalization of nitriles can also be accomplished at the alpha-position of alkanenitriles and at the ortho-position of cyanoarenes. On the other hand, the C-CN bond of nitriles has rarely been recognized as a valuable reaction site due to its thermodynamic robustness. Although it has been known for a long time in organometallic chemistry that C-CN bonds can be cleaved by transition-metal complexes, this elemental reaction had not been used in catalytic synthetic transformations of nitriles until two decades ago. This review surveys the progress of metal-catalyzed reactions of nitriles via C-CN bond activation. After introducing several different modes to activate C-CN bonds by various transition metals, catalytic reactions are categorized mainly into two parts: (i) reactions with CN as a leaving group and (ii) reactions with nitriles as a source of CN groups. Cross-coupling-type transformations with a cyano leaving group, cyanation reactions using nitriles as a nontoxic cyano source, and novel synthetic reactions such as carbocyanation are highlighted together with useful demonstrations of their utility in organic synthesis.","453":"Click chemistry, proposed nearly 20 years ago, promised access to novel chemical space by empowering combinatorial library synthesis with a \"few good reactions\". These click reactions fulfilled key criteria (broad scope, quantitative yield, abundant starting material, mild reaction conditions, and high chemoselectivity), keeping the focus on molecules that would be easy to make, yet structurally diverse. This philosophy bears a striking resemblance to DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology, the now-dominant combinatorial chemistry paradigm. This review highlights the similarities between click and DEL reaction design and deployment in combinatorial library settings, providing a framework for the design of new DEL synthesis technologies to enable next-generation drug discovery.","454":"NaCT (SLC13A5; mINDY), a sodium-coupled citrate transporter, is the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila INDY. Loss-of-function mutations in human NaCT cause severe complications with neonatal epilepsy and encephalopathy (EIEE25). Surprisingly, mice lacking this transporter do not have this detrimental brain phenotype. The marked differences in transport kinetics between mouse and human NaCTs provide at least a partial explanation for this conundrum, but a structural basis for the differences is lacking. Neither human nor mouse NaCT has been crystallized, and any information known on their structures is based entirely on what was inferred from the structure of VcINDY, a related transporter in bacteria. Here, we highlight the functional features of human and mouse NaCTs and provide a plausible molecular basis for the differences based on a full-length homology modeling approach. The transport characteristics of human NaCT markedly differ from those of VcINDY. Therefore, the modeling with VcINDY as the template is flawed, but this is the best available option at this time. With the newly deduced model, we determined the likely locations of the disease-causing mutations and propose a new classification for the mutations based on their location and potential impact on transport function. This new information should pave the way for future design and development of novel therapeutics to restore the lost function of the mutant transporters as a treatment strategy for patients with EIEE25.","455":"Interatomic or intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) is a nonlocal electronic decay mechanism occurring in weakly bound matter. In an ICD process, energy released by electronic relaxation of an excited atom or molecule leads to ionization of a neighboring one via Coulombic electron interactions. ICD has been predicted theoretically in the mid nineties of the last century, and its existence has been confirmed experimentally approximately ten years later. Since then, a number of fundamental and applied aspects have been studied in this quickly growing field of research. This review provides an introduction to ICD and draws the connection to related energy transfer and ionization processes. The theoretical approaches for the description of ICD as well as the experimental techniques developed and employed for its investigation are described. The existing body of literature on experimental and theoretical studies of ICD processes in different atomic and molecular systems is reviewed.","456":"Gold carbenes are highly active intermediates in homogeneous gold catalysis, enabling a large array of transformations such as C-H\/X-H insertions, cyclopropanations, and 1,2-migrations. Unlike C-H\/X-H insertions and cyclopropanations, 1,2-migrations onto gold carbene centers seem to be attracting less attention. There has been no comprehensive review focusing on this topic, even though this chemistry has become a powerful tool for the rapid and simple construction of molecular complexity. This review provides comprehensive and critical information on the 1,2-migrations onto gold carbene centers, drawing a preliminary conclusion on the migratory aptitude of various groups. The review is divided into several parts according to the kind of carbene precursors.","457":null,"458":"Compounds having cyclic molecular frameworks are highly regarded for their abundance and diverse utilities. In particular, medium-sized carbocycles and heterocycles exist in a broad spectrum of natural products, bioactive therapeutics, and medicinally significant synthetic molecules. Metal-mediated methods have been developed for the preparation of compounds containing a medium-sized ring (MSR) through cyclization of different classes of substrates and acyclic precursors. This review focuses on the methodologies for construction of MSRs via gold catalysis. Given the challenges in enabling the assembly of different ring sizes, we present here accounts on Au-mediated cyclization giving notable 7-membered and medium-sized (8-11-membered ring) structures. Emphasis on the pathway and mode of cyclization and the selection of precursors ranging from structurally biased compounds were outlined. Reactivity patterns and the choice of efficient Au catalysts for controlling reaction performance and selectivity in addition to mechanistic attributes are examined.","459":"We review progress in neural network (NN)-based methods for the construction of interatomic potentials from discrete samples (such as ab initio energies) for applications in classical and quantum dynamics including reaction dynamics and computational spectroscopy. The main focus is on methods for building molecular potential energy surfaces (PES) in internal coordinates that explicitly include all many-body contributions, even though some of the methods we review limit the degree of coupling, due either to a desire to limit computational cost or to limited data. Explicit and direct treatment of all many-body contributions is only practical for sufficiently small molecules, which are therefore our primary focus. This includes small molecules on surfaces. We consider direct, single NN PES fitting as well as more complex methods that impose structure (such as a multibody representation) on the PES function, either through the architecture of one NN or by using multiple NNs. We show how NNs are effective in building representations with low-dimensional functions including dimensionality reduction. We consider NN-based approaches to build PESs in the sums-of-product form important for quantum dynamics, ways to treat symmetry, and issues related to sampling data distributions and the relation between PES errors and errors in observables. We highlight combinations of NNs with other ideas such as permutationally invariant polynomials or sums of environment-dependent atomic contributions, which have recently emerged as powerful tools for building highly accurate PESs for relatively large molecular and reactive systems.","460":"Selective C-C bond cleavage under mild conditions can serve as a valuable tool for organic syntheses and macromolecular degradation. However, the conventional chemical methods have largely involved the use of noble transition-metal catalysts as well as the stoichiometric and perhaps environmentally unfriendly oxidants, compromising the overall sustainable nature of C-C transformation chemistry. In this regard, electrochemical C-C bond cleavage has been identified as a sustainable and scalable strategy that employs electricity to replace byproduct-generating chemical reagents. To date, the progress made in this area has mainly relied on Kolbe electrolysis and related processes. Encouragingly, more and more examples of the cleavage of C-C bonds via other maneuvers have recently been developed. This review provides an overview on the most recent and significant developments in electrochemically oxidative selective C-C bond cleavage, with an emphasis on both synthetic outcomes and reaction mechanisms, and it showcases the innate advantages and exciting potentials of electrochemical synthesis.","461":null,"462":"Computational studies play an increasingly important role in chemistry and biophysics, mainly thanks to improvements in hardware and algorithms. In drug discovery and development, computational studies can reduce the costs and risks of bringing a new medicine to market. Computational simulations are mainly used to optimize promising new compounds by estimating their binding affinity to proteins. This is challenging due to the complexity of the simulated system. To assess the present and future value of simulation for drug discovery, we review key applications of advanced methods for sampling complex free-energy landscapes at near nonergodicity conditions and for estimating the rate coefficients of very slow processes of pharmacological interest. We outline the statistical mechanics and computational background behind this research, including methods such as steered molecular dynamics and metadynamics. We review recent applications to pharmacology and drug discovery and discuss possible guidelines for the practitioner. Recent trends in machine learning are also briefly discussed. Thanks to the rapid development of methods for characterizing and quantifying rare events, simulation's role in drug discovery is likely to expand, making it a valuable complement to experimental and clinical approaches.","463":"","464":"During the last decades, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has become an indispensable method for probing the structure and composition of heterogeneous catalysts, revealing the nature of the active sites and establishing links between structural motifs in a catalyst, local electronic structure, and catalytic properties. Here we discuss the fundamental principles of the XAS method and describe the progress in the instrumentation and data analysis approaches undertaken for deciphering X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. Recent usages of XAS in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, with emphasis on examples concerning electrocatalysis, will be presented. The latter is a rapidly developing field with immense industrial applications but also unique challenges in terms of the experimental characterization restrictions and advanced modeling approaches required. This review will highlight the new insight that can be gained with XAS on complex real-world electrocatalysts including their working mechanisms and the dynamic processes taking place in the course of a chemical reaction. More specifically, we will discuss applications of in situ and operando XAS to probe the catalyst's interactions with the environment (support, electrolyte, ligands, adsorbates, reaction products, and intermediates) and its structural, chemical, and electronic transformations as it adapts to the reaction conditions.","465":"Low molecular weight synthetic peptides have been demonstrated to be effective catalysts for an increasingly wide array of asymmetric transformations. In many cases, these peptide-based catalysts have enabled novel multifunctional substrate activation modes and unprecedented selectivity manifolds. These features, along with their ease of preparation, modular and tunable structures, and often biomimetic attributes make peptides well-suited as chiral catalysts and of broad interest. Many examples of peptide-catalyzed asymmetric reactions have appeared in the literature since the last survey of this broad field in Chemical Reviews (Chem. Rev. 2007, 107, 5759-5812). The overarching goal of this new Review is to provide a comprehensive account of the numerous advances in the field. As a corollary to this goal, we survey the many different types of catalytic reactions, ranging from acylation to C-C bond formation, in which peptides have been successfully employed. In so doing, we devote significant discussion to the structural and mechanistic aspects of these reactions that are perhaps specific to peptide-based catalysts and their interactions with substrates and\/or reagents.","466":null,"467":null,"468":"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique physical and chemical properties that drive their use in a variety of commercial and industrial applications. CNTs are commonly oxidized prior to their use to enhance dispersion in polar solvents by deliberately grafting oxygen-containing functional groups onto CNT surfaces. In addition, CNT surface oxides can be unintentionally formed or modified after CNTs are released into the environment through exposure to reactive oxygen species and\/or ultraviolet irradiation. Consequently, it is important to understand the impact of CNT surface oxidation on the environmental fate, transport, and toxicity of CNTs. In this review, we describe the specific role of oxygen-containing functional groups on the important environmental behaviors of CNTs in aqueous media (e.g., colloidal stability, adsorption, and photochemistry) as well as their biological impact. We place special emphasis on the value of systematically varying and quantifying surface oxides as a route to identifying quantitative structure-property relationships. The role of oxygen-containing functional groups in regulating the efficacy of CNT-enabled water treatment technologies and the influence of surface oxides on other carbon-based nanomaterials are also evaluated and discussed.","469":"This review discusses recent advances and future research priorities in the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field. While the community has witnessed tremendous advances through research conducted on two-dimensional (2D) TMD crystals, it is vital to seek new research opportunities beyond developed areas. To this end, in this review we focus principally on articulating areas of need in the preparation and analysis of TMD crystals encompassing dimensionalities and morphologies beyond 2D. Ultimately, the development of new synthetic methods to control key structural features of low-dimensional TMD crystals (e.g., dimensionality, morphology, and phase) will afford access to a broader range of breakthrough properties for this intriguing material class. We begin with a brief overview of the evolution of 2D TMD research, discussing both the synthetic methods that have enabled the preparation of these materials and the manifold properties they possess. We focus the bulk of our review on discussion of recent advances associated with 1D TMD crystals, which are often referred to as TMD nanoribbons, and include a discussion of recent efforts in 0D systems. We discuss synthetic strategies that have been developed to prepare such beyond 2D crystals and highlight their unique physical and chemical properties. After reviewing the host of analytical tools available for characterization of TMD materials, we identify future analytical instrumentation needs. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects of beyond 2D TMD crystals in optoelectronics, catalysis, and quantum information science.","470":"The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is essential for their survival in harsh environments and provides intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This membrane is remarkable; it is a highly asymmetric lipid bilayer. The inner leaflet of the outer membrane contains phospholipids, whereas the fatty acyl chains attached to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) comprise the hydrophobic portion of the outer leaflet. This lipid asymmetry, and in particular the exclusion of phospholipids from the outer leaflet, is key to creating an almost impenetrable barrier to hydrophobic molecules that can otherwise pass through phospholipid bilayers. It has long been known that these lipids are not made in the outer membrane. It is now believed that conserved multisubunit protein machines extract these lipids after their synthesis is completed at the inner membrane and transport them to the outer membrane. A longstanding question is how the cell builds and maintains this asymmetric lipid bilayer in coordination with the assembly of the other components of the cell envelope. This Review describes the trans-envelope lipid transport systems that have been identified to participate in outer-membrane biogenesis: LPS transport via the Lpt machine, and phospholipid transport via the Mla pathway and several recently proposed transporters.","471":"Hexagonal perovskites, in contrast to the more familiar perovskites, when oxides, allow for face-sharing of metal-oxygen octahedra or trigonal prisms within their structural frameworks. This results in dimers, trimers, tetramers, or longer fragments of chains of face-sharing octahedra in the crystal structures, and consequently in much shorter metal-metal distances and lower metal-oxygen-metal bond angles than are seen in the more familiar perovskites. The presence of the face-sharing octahedra can have a dramatic impact on magnetic properties of these compounds, and dimer-based materials, in particular, have been the subjects of many quantum-materials-directed studies in materials physics. Hexagonal oxide perovskites are also of contemporary interest due to their potential for geometrical frustration of the ordering of magnetic moments or orbital occupancies at low temperatures, which is especially relevant to their significance as quantum materials. As such, several hexagonal oxide perovskites have been identified as potential candidates for hosting the quantum-spin-liquid state at low temperatures. In our view, hexagonal oxide perovskites are fertile ground for finding new quantum materials. This review briefly describes the solid state chemistry of many of these materials.","472":null,"473":"Sustainable energy generation calls for a shift away from centralized, high-temperature, energy-intensive processes to decentralized, low-temperature conversions that can be powered by electricity produced from renewable sources. Electrocatalytic conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks would allow carbon recycling of distributed, energy-poor resources in the absence of sinks and sources of high-grade heat. Selective, efficient electrocatalysts that operate at low temperatures are needed for electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) to upgrade the feedstocks. For effective generation of energy-dense chemicals and fuels, two design criteria must be met: (i) a high H:C ratio via ECH to allow for high-quality fuels and blends and (ii) a lower O:C ratio in the target molecules via electrochemical decarboxylation\/deoxygenation to improve the stability of fuels and chemicals. The goal of this review is to determine whether the following questions have been sufficiently answered in the open literature, and if not, what additional information is required:(1)What organic functionalities are accessible for electrocatalytic hydrogenation under a set of reaction conditions? How do substitutions and functionalities impact the activity and selectivity of ECH?(2)What material properties cause an electrocatalyst to be active for ECH? Can general trends in ECH be formulated based on the type of electrocatalyst?(3)What are the impacts of reaction conditions (electrolyte concentration, pH, operating potential) and reactor types?","474":"2,2,2-Trifluorodiazoethane (CF3CHN2) has been proven to be a valuable reagent for the rapid synthesis of various classes of trifluoromethyl-substituted organic molecules in both academic and industrial research. The reagent was prepared first in 1943, but only recently it received a great attention from the scientific community. Protocols for in situ generation, in flow generation, and crystalline analogues of CF3CHN2 were developed during the past decade and have led to an ever-increasing number of publications on the topic. The current review summarizes and comprehensively analyzes all manuscripts in a peer-reviewed literature on 2,2,2-trifluorodiazoethane since its discovery in 1943 until today (as of 19 June 2020). These include contributions mostly overseen by scientific community before. A particular emphasis of this review is to classify the existing reactivity modes of CF3CHN2 and to systematically analyze the corresponding reaction mechanisms in details. At the end of this review, several undeveloped areas for CF3CHN2 are outlined, based on the overseen precedents in the literature.","475":"The lack of in vitro tissue and organ models capable of mimicking human physiology severely hinders the development and clinical translation of therapies and drugs with higher in vivo efficacy. Bioprinting allow us to fill this gap and generate 3D tissue analogues with complex functional and structural organization through the precise spatial positioning of multiple materials and cells. In this review, we report the latest developments in terms of bioprinting technologies for the manufacturing of cellular constructs with particular emphasis on material extrusion, jetting, and vat photopolymerization. We then describe the different base polymers employed in the formulation of bioinks for bioprinting and examine the strategies used to tailor their properties according to both processability and tissue maturation requirements. By relating function to organization in human development, we examine the potential of pluripotent stem cells in the context of bioprinting toward a new generation of tissue models for personalized medicine. We also highlight the most relevant attempts to engineer artificial models for the study of human organogenesis, disease, and drug screening. Finally, we discuss the most pressing challenges, opportunities, and future prospects in the field of bioprinting for tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine (RM).","476":"Squaramides represent a class of vinylogous amides that are derived from the squarate oxocarbon dianion. While they have been known since the 1950s, squaramides have only recently emerged (in the last 10-20 years) as particularly useful chemical entities in a variety of applications. They have found particular use as bioisosteric replacements of several heteroatomic functional groups, notably ureas, thioureas, guanidines, and cyanoguanidines, owing in part to their similar capacity toward hydrogen bonding and ability to reliably engender defined conformations in drug ligands. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the deployment of squaramides as bioisosteres within the drug design landscape. Their utility in this space is further rationalized through an examination of the physicochemical properties of squaramides in contrast to other functional groups. In addition, we consider the deployment of related cyclic oxocarbanion derivatives as potential bioisosteric replacements of ureas and related functional groups.","477":"Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and\/or macroporous system. These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests. In addition to the enhanced mass transfer leading to high activity, selectivity, and cycle time, another essential merit of the hierarchical structure in zeolite materials is that it can significantly improve the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials resulting in the minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption. Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites. Herein, we provide an overview of recent achievements in the field, highlighting the significant progress in the past decade on the development of novel and remarkable strategies to create an additional pore system in zeolites. The most innovative synthesis approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality while establishing a firm link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality in zeolites. Zeolites with different hierarchically porous structures, i.e., micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure, are then analyzed in detail with concrete examples to illustrate their benefits and their fabrications. The significantly improved performances in catalytic, environmental, and biological applications resulting from enhanced mass transport properties are discussed through a series of representative cases. In the concluding part, we envision the emergence of \"material-properties-by-quantitative and real rational design\" based on the \"generalized Murray's Law\" that enables the predictable and controlled productions of bioinspired hierarchically structured zeolites. This Review is expected to attract important interests from catalysis, separation, environment, advanced materials, and chemical engineering fields as well as biomedicine for artificial organ and drug delivery systems.","478":"Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) are reinvigorating vaccine strategies in cancer immunotherapy. In contrast to adoptive T-cell therapy and checkpoint blockade, the PCV strategy modulates the innate and adaptive immune systems with broader activation to redeploy antitumor immunity with individualized tumor-specific antigens (neoantigens). Following a sequential scheme of tumor biopsy, mutation analysis, and epitope prediction, the administration of neoantigens with synthetic long peptide (SLP) or mRNA formulations dramatically improves the population and activity of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Despite the promising prospect of PCVs, there is still great potential for optimizing prevaccination procedures and vaccine potency. In particular, the arduous development of tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-based vaccines provides valuable experience and rational principles for augmenting vaccine potency which is expected to advance PCV through the design of adjuvants, delivery systems, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) reversion since current personalized vaccination simply admixes antigens with adjuvants. Considering the broader application of TAA-based vaccine design, these two strategies complement each other and can lead to both personalized and universal therapeutic methods. Chemical strategies provide vast opportunities for (1) exploring novel adjuvants, including synthetic molecules and materials with optimizable activity, (2) constructing efficient and precise delivery systems to avoid systemic diffusion, improve biosafety, target secondary lymphoid organs, and enhance antigen presentation, and (3) combining bioengineering methods to innovate improvements in conventional vaccination, \"smartly\" re-educate the TME, and modulate antitumor immunity. As chemical strategies have proven versatility, reliability, and universality in the design of T cell- and B cell-based antitumor vaccines, the union of such numerous chemical methods in vaccine construction is expected to provide new vigor and vitality in cancer treatment.","479":"Precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and crystal phase of random alloy and intermetallic nanocrystals has been intensively explored in technologically important applications in recent years. Different from the monometallic nanocrystals and other types of structural nanocrystals such as core-shell and heterostructured nanocrystals, well-defined multimetallic random alloy and intermetallic nanocrystals exhibit unique and intriguing physicochemical properties, serving as ideal models for benefiting the structure-to-property studies.

Some representative examples are purposely selected for emphasizing basic concepts and mechanistic understanding. We then highlight the fascinating properties and widespread applications of random alloy and intermetallic nanocrystals in electrocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, optical and photocatalysis, as well as magnetism and conclude the review by addressing the prospects and current challenges for the controlled synthesis of random alloy and intermetallic nanocrystals.","480":"The inkjet technique has the capability of generating droplets in the picoliter volume range, firing thousands of times in a few seconds and printing in the noncontact manner. Since its emergence, inkjet technology has been widely utilized in the publishing industry for printing of text and pictures. As the technology developed, its applications have been expanded from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) and even used to fabricate components of electronic devices. At the end of the twentieth century, researchers were aware of the potential value of this technology in life sciences and tissue engineering because its picoliter-level printing unit is suitable for depositing biological components. Currently inkjet technology has been becoming a practical tool in modern medicine serving for drug development, scaffold building, and cell depositing. In this article, we first review the history, principles and different methods of developing this technology. Next, we focus on the recent achievements of inkjet printing in the biological field. Inkjet bioprinting of generic biomaterials, biomacromolecules, DNAs, and cells and their major applications are introduced in order of increasing complexity. The current limitations\/challenges and corresponding solutions of this technology are also discussed. A new concept, biopixels, is put forward with a combination of the key characteristics of inkjet printing and basic biological units to bring a comprehensive view on inkjet-based bioprinting.

Over the last two decades, iridium catalysis has evolved as a valuable tool enabling the stereocontrolled synthesis of chiral molecules via C-H activation. The development of iridium-based systems with various chiral ligand classes, as well as studies of their reaction mechanisms, has resulted in dynamic progress in this area.

While there has been considerable success in the biofabrication of large- and small-vessel replacements, functional microvasculature has been particularly challenging to engineer due to its size and complexity. Recently, three-dimensional bioprinting has expanded the possibilities of fabricating sophisticated microvascular systems by enabling precise spatiotemporal placement of cells and biomaterials based on computer-aided design. However, there are still significant challenges facing the development of printable biomaterials that promote robust formation and controlled 3D organization of microvascular networks. This review provides a thorough examination and critical evaluation of contemporary biomaterials and their specific roles in bioprinting microvasculature. We first provide an overview of bioprinting methods and techniques that enable the fabrication of microvessels. We then offer an in-depth critical analysis on the use of hydrogel bioinks for printing microvascularized constructs within the framework of current bioprinting modalities.

The building blocks are often hydrogel-based bioinks, which need to be printed into structures with high shape fidelity to the intended computer-aided design. For optimal cell performance, relatively soft and printable inks are preferred, although these undergo significant deformation during the printing process, which may impair shape fidelity. While the concept of good or poor printability seems rather intuitive, its quantitative definition lacks consensus and depends on multiple rheological and chemical parameters of the ink. This review discusses qualitative and quantitative methodologies to evaluate printability of bioinks for extrusion- and lithography-based bioprinting. The physicochemical parameters influencing shape fidelity are discussed, together with their importance in establishing new models, predictive tools and printing methods that are deemed instrumental for the design of next-generation bioinks, and for reproducible comparison of their structural performance.","488":"Employing phenols and phenol derivatives as electrophiles for cross-coupling reactions has numerous advantages over commonly used aryl halides in terms of environmental-friendliness and sustainability. In the early stage of discovering such transformations, most efforts have been devoted to utilizing highly activated sulfonate types of phenol derivatives (e.g., OTf, OTs, etc.), which have similar reactivities to the corresponding aryl halides. However, a continuing scientific challenge is how to achieve the direct C-O functionalizations of relatively less-activated phenol derivatives more efficiently. In this review, we will focus on the recent updates on the C-O functionalizations of less-activated phenol derivatives, from aryl carboxylates (e.g., pivalates, acetates, etc.), aryl carbamates and carbonates, to aryl ethers (anisoles, diaryl ethers, aryl pyridyl ethers, aryl silyl ethers), to phenolate salts, and ultimately to simply unprotected phenols, sorted by the types of bond formations. Both transition-metal-catalyzed and transition-metal-free protocols will be covered and discussed in detail. Instead, the C-O functionalizations of aryl sulfonates will not be covered extensively unless they are closely related, due to their high reactivity. Since aryl ethers and phenols represent the main linkages or units in lignin biomass, the successes of such transformations will potentially make major contributions to the direct lignin biomass upgrading and depolymerization.","489":"Carbon materials, with their diverse allotropes, have played significant roles in our daily life and the development of material science. Following 0D C60 and 1D carbon nanotube, 2D graphene materials, with their distinctively fascinating properties, have been receiving tremendous attention since 2004. To fulfill the efficient utilization of 2D graphene sheets in applications such as energy storage and conversion, electrochemical catalysis, and environmental remediation, 3D structures constructed by graphene sheets have been attempted over the past decade, giving birth to a new generation of graphene materials called 3D graphene materials.

Furthermore, little is known with respect to the underlying mechanisms which determine a bioink's printability. A thorough understanding of these mechanisms is key to the intentional design of new bioinks. For the purposes of this review, the domain of printability is defined as the bioink requirements which are unique to bioprinting and occur during the printing process. Within this domain, the different aspects of printability and the factors which influence them are reviewed. The extrudability, filament classification, shape fidelity, and printing accuracy of bioinks are examined in detail with respect to their rheological properties, chemical structure, and printing parameters. These relationships are discussed and areas where further research is needed, are identified.

We also showcase many of the chemical applications and scientific advances made by using real-time electronic structure calculations and provide an outlook of possible new directions.","495":"Enzymatic reactions and noncovalent (i.e., supramolecular) interactions are two fundamental nongenetic attributes of life. Enzymatic noncovalent synthesis (ENS) refers to a process where enzymatic reactions control intermolecular noncovalent interactions for spatial organization of higher-order molecular assemblies that exhibit emergent properties and functions. Like enzymatic covalent synthesis (ECS), in which an enzyme catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds to generate individual molecules, ENS is a unifying theme for understanding the functions, morphologies, and locations of molecular ensembles in cellular environments. This review intends to provide a summary of the works of ENS within the past decade and emphasize ENS for functions. After comparing ECS and ENS, we describe a few representative examples where nature uses ENS, as a rule of life, to create the ensembles of biomacromolecules for emergent properties\/functions in a myriad of cellular processes. Then, we focus on ENS of man-made (synthetic) molecules in cell-free conditions, classified by the types of enzymes. After that, we introduce the exploration of ENS of man-made molecules in the context of cells by discussing intercellular, peri\/intracellular, and subcellular ENS for cell morphogenesis, molecular imaging, cancer therapy, and other applications. Finally, we provide a perspective on the promises of ENS for developing molecular assemblies\/processes for functions. This review aims to be an updated introduction for researchers who are interested in exploring noncovalent synthesis for developing molecular science and technologies to address societal needs.","496":"The reductive amination, the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with ammonia or an amine in the presence of a reducing agent and often a catalyst, is an important amine synthesis and has been intensively investigated in academia and industry for a century. Besides aldehydes, ketones, or amines, starting materials have been used that can be converted into an aldehyde or ketone (for instance, carboxylic acids or organic carbonate or nitriles) or into an amine (for instance, a nitro compound) in the presence of the same reducing agent and catalyst. Mechanistically, the reaction starts with a condensation step during which the carbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or an amine, forming the corresponding imine followed by the reduction of the imine to the alkyl amine product. Many of these reduction steps require the presence of a catalyst to activate the reducing agent. The reductive amination is impressive with regard to the product scope since primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines are accessible and hydrogen is the most attractive reducing agent, especially if large-scale product formation is an issue, since hydrogen is inexpensive and abundantly available. Alkyl amines are intensively produced and use fine and bulk chemicals. They are key functional groups in many pharmaceuticals, agro chemicals, or materials. In this review, we summarize the work published on reductive amination employing hydrogen as the reducing agent. No comprehensive review focusing on this subject has been published since 1948, albeit many interesting summaries dealing with one or the other aspect of reductive amination have appeared. Impressive progress in using catalysts based on earth-abundant metals, especially nanostructured heterogeneous catalysts, has been made during the early development of the field and in recent years.","497":"This Review chronicles the progress made in the field of small fluorocarbon synthesis since their invention in the early 1930s by Thomas Midgley, Jr., and his coworkers, with special focus on their application as refrigerants, foam expansion agents, aerosol propellants, and precision solvents.

Lithium metal anodes are not only required for the development of innovative cell concepts such as lithium-air or lithium-sulfur batteries, they can also increase the energy density of batteries with intercalation-type cathodes. The use of solid electrolyte separators is especially promising to develop well-performing lithium metal anodes, because they can act as a mechanical barrier to avoid unwanted dendritic growth of lithium through the cell. However, inhomogeneous electrodeposition and contact loss often hinder the application of a lithium metal anode in solid-state batteries. In this review, we assess the physicochemical concepts that describe the fundamental mechanisms governing lithium metal anode performance in combination with inorganic solid electrolytes. In particular, our discussion of kinetic rate limitations and morphological stability intends to stimulate further progress in the field of lithium metal anodes.","504":"With the rapid development of high technology, chemical science is not as it used to be a century ago. Many chemists acquire and utilize skills that are well beyond the traditional definition of chemistry. The digital age has transformed chemistry laboratories. One aspect of this transformation is the progressing implementation of electronics and computer science in chemistry research. In the past decade, numerous chemistry-oriented studies have benefited from the implementation of electronic modules, including microcontroller boards (MCBs), single-board computers (SBCs), professional grade control and data acquisition systems, as well as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In particular, MCBs and SBCs provide good value for money. The application areas for electronic modules in chemistry research include construction of simple detection systems based on spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry principles, customizing laboratory devices for automation of common laboratory practices, control of reaction systems (batch- and flow-based), extraction systems, chromatographic and electrophoretic systems, microfluidic systems (classical and nonclassical), custom-built polymerase chain reaction devices, gas-phase analyte detection systems, chemical robots and drones, construction of FPGA-based imaging systems, and the Internet-of-Chemical-Things.

One paradigmatic process to accomplish this goal efficiently is the transition-metal-catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction, since it permits the formation of a wide range of highly functionalized 6-membered carbo- and heterocyclic molecules in a single step with high efficiency and perfect atom economy. A key feature of these transformations is the mechanistic pathway that they follow, since a deep knowledge of this mechanism may enable us to understand and improve the efficiency of the reaction.

Among them, 3D cell printing is a pioneering technology to facilitate the recapitulation of unique features of complex human tissues and organs with high process flexibility and versatility. Bioinks, combinations of printable hydrogel and cells, can be utilized to create 3D cell-printed constructs. The bioactive cues of bioinks directly trigger cells to induce tissue morphogenesis. Among the various printable hydrogels, the tissue- and organ-specific decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) can exert synergistic effects in supporting various cells at any component by facilitating specific physiological properties. In this review, we aim to discuss a new paradigm of dECM-based bioinks able to recapitulate the inherent microenvironmental niche in 3D cell-printed constructs.

MIPs came into the spotlight in 1993 when they were dubbed \"antibody mimics,\" and ever since, they have been widely studied for the extraction or trapping of chemical pollutants, in immunoassays, and for the design of sensors. Owing to novel synthesis strategies resulting in more biocompatible MIPs in the form of soluble nanogels, these synthetic antibodies have found favor in the biomedical domain since 2010, when for the first time, they were shown to capture and eliminate a toxin in live mice. This review, covering the years 2015-2020, will first describe the rationale behind these antibody mimics, and the different synthesis methods that have been employed for the preparation of MIPs destined for in vitro and in vivo targeting and bioimaging of cancer biomarkers, an emerging and fast-growing area of MIP applications. MIPs have been synthesized for targeting and visualizing glycans and protein-based cell receptors overexpressed in certain diseases, which are well-known biomarkers for example for tumors. When loaded with drugs, the MIPs could locally kill the tumor cells, making them efficient therapeutic agents. We will end the review by reporting how MIPs themselves can act as therapeutics by inhibiting cancer growth. These works mark a new opening in the use of MIPs for antibody therapy and even immunotherapy, as materials of the future in nanomedicine.","509":null,"510":"","511":"In this review, transition metal-catalyzed methodologies and applications that exploit C-C bond cleavage of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are summarized with a focus on cycloaddition and related addition reactions.

However, when optimizing the target-binding or pharmacokinetic properties of cyclic peptides, it is frequently necessary to \"fine-tune\" their conformations, e.g., by imposing greater rigidity, by subtly altering certain side chain vectors, or by adjusting the global shape of the macrocycle. This review systematically examines the various types of structural modifications that can be made to cyclic peptides in order to achieve such conformational control.","513":"Alkyl radicals are key intermediates in organic synthesis. Their classic generation from alkyl halides has a severe drawback due to the employment of toxic tin hydrides to the point that \"flight from the tyranny of tin\" in radical processes was considered for a long time an unavoidable issue. This review summarizes the main alternative approaches for the generation of unstabilized alkyl radicals, using photons as traceless promoters. The recent development in photochemical and photocatalyzed processes enabled the discovery of a plethora of new alkyl radical precursors, opening the world of radical chemistry to a broader community, thus allowing a new era of photon democracy.","514":"Heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials (HPCMs) have found extensive applications in adsorption\/separation, organic catalysis, sensing, and energy conversion\/storage. The judicious choice of carbon precursors is crucial for the manufacture of HPCMs with specific usages and maximization of their functions. In this regard, polymers as precursors have demonstrated great promise because of their versatile molecular and nanoscale structures, modulatable chemical composition, and rich processing techniques to generate textures that, in combination with proper solid-state chemistry, can be maintained throughout carbonization. This Review comprehensively surveys the progress in polymer-derived functional HPCMs in terms of how to produce and control their porosities, heteroatom doping effects, and morphologies and their related use. First, we summarize and discuss synthetic approaches, including hard and soft templating methods as well as direct synthesis strategies employing polymers to control the pores and\/or heteroatoms in HPCMs. Second, we summarize the heteroatom doping effects on the thermal stability, electronic and optical properties, and surface chemistry of HPCMs. Specifically, the heteroatom doping effect, which involves both single-type heteroatom doping and codoping of two or more types of heteroatoms into the carbon network, is discussed. Considering the significance of the morphologies of HPCMs in their application spectrum, potential choices of suitable polymeric precursors and strategies to precisely regulate the morphologies of HPCMs are presented. Finally, we provide our perspective on how to predefine the structures of HPCMs by using polymers to realize their potential applications in the current fields of energy generation\/conversion and environmental remediation.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are ideal candidates for TSCs due to their tunable band gaps, high PCE up to 25.2%, and easy fabrication. PSCs with high PCEs are typically fabricated via a low temperature solution method, which are easy to combine with many other types of solar cells like silicon (Si), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), narrow band gap PSCs, dye-sensitized, organic, and quantum dot solar cells. As a matter of fact, perovskite TSCs have stimulated enormous scientific and industrial interest since their first development in 2014. Significant progress has been made on the development of perovskite TSCs both in the research laboratories and industrial companies. This review will rationalize the recent exciting advancement in perovskite TSCs. We begin with the introduction of the historical development of TSCs in a broader context, followed by the summary of the state-of-the-art development of perovskite TSCs with various types of device architectures. We then discuss the strategies for improving the PCEs of perovskite TSCs, including but not limited to the design considerations on the transparency of perovskite absorbers and metal electrodes, protective layers, and recombination layers (RLs)\/tunnel junctions (TJs), with a particular focus on the band gap tuning and thickness adjustment of active layers. We subsequently introduce a range of measurement techniques for the characterization of perovskite TSCs. We also cover other core issues related to the large-scale applications and commercialization.

The atomic dispersion nature of the catalytic metal centers makes them an ideal system for bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous metal catalysts. The recent rapid development of new synthetic strategies has led to the explosive growth of ADCs with a wide spectrum of metal atoms dispersed on supports of different chemical compositions and natures. The availability of diverse ADCs creates a powerful materials platform for investigating mechanisms of complicated heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic levels. Considering most dispersed metal atoms on ADCs are coordinated by the donors from supports, this review will demonstrate how the surface coordination chemistry plays an important role in determining the catalytic performance of ADCs. This review will start from the link between coordination chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. After the brief description on the advantages and limitations of common structure characterization methods in determining the coordination structure of ADCs, the surface coordination chemistry of ADCs on different types of supports will be discussed. We will mainly illustrate how the local and vicinal coordination species on different support systems act together with the dispersed catalytic metal center to determine the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of ADCs.

This review summarizes the most recent reports concerning electronic devices enabled by either of the two primary categories of OFM, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs). Devices in which the OFM plays an active role (as opposed to acting only as a selective sorbent or filter) are the principal focus, with examples cited that include field-effect transistors, capacitors, memristors, and a wide variety of sensing architectures.

On the basis of the literature discussed here, we conclude that OFM constitute a unique class of electronic materials with characteristics and advantages that are distinct from either conventional inorganic semiconductors or organic conductors. This suggests a bright future for these materials in applications such as edge computing, resistive switching, and mechanically flexible sensing and electronics.","521":"There has been huge progress in the discovery of targeted cancer therapies in recent years. However, even for the most successful and impactful cancer drugs which have been approved, both innate and acquired mechanisms of resistance are commonplace. These emerging mechanisms of resistance have been studied intensively, which has enabled drug discovery scientists to learn how it may be possible to overcome such resistance in subsequent generations of treatments. In some cases, novel drug candidates have been able to supersede previously approved agents; in other cases they have been used sequentially or in combinations with existing treatments. This review summarizes the current field in terms of the challenges and opportunities that cancer resistance presents to drug discovery scientists, with a focus on small molecule therapeutics. As part of this review, common themes and approaches have been identified which have been utilized to successfully target emerging mechanisms of resistance. This includes the increase in target potency and selectivity, alternative chemical scaffolds, change of mechanism of action (covalents, PROTACs), increases in blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP), and the targeting of allosteric pockets.

Most efforts in this area have focused on provisioning compounds of importance to life by multistep synthetic routes that do not resemble biochemistry. However, gaining insight into why core metabolism uses the molecules, reactions, pathways, and overall organization that it does requires us to consider molecules not only as synthetic end goals. Equally important are the dynamic processes that build them up and break them down. This perspective has led many researchers to the hypothesis that the first stage of the origin of life began with the onset of a primitive nonenzymatic version of metabolism, initially catalyzed by naturally occurring minerals and metal ions. This view of life's origins has come to be known as \"metabolism first\". Continuity with modern metabolism would require a primitive version of metabolism to build and break down ketoacids, sugars, amino acids, and ribonucleotides in much the same way as the pathways that do it today. This review discusses metabolic pathways of relevance to the origin of life in a manner accessible to chemists, and summarizes experiments suggesting several pathways might have their roots in prebiotic chemistry. Finally, key remaining milestones for the protometabolic hypothesis are highlighted.","523":"Owing to their molecular building blocks, yet highly crystalline nature, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) sit at the interface between molecule and material. Their diverse structures and compositions enable them to be useful materials as catalysts in heterogeneous reactions, electrical conductors in energy storage and transfer applications, chromophores in photoenabled chemical transformations, and beyond. In all cases, density functional theory (DFT) and higher-level methods for electronic structure determination provide valuable quantitative information about the electronic properties that underpin the functions of these frameworks. However, there are only two general modeling approaches in conventional electronic structure software packages: those that treat materials as extended, periodic solids, and those that treat materials as discrete molecules. Each approach has features and benefits; both have been widely employed to understand the emergent chemistry that arises from the formation of the metal-organic interface. This Review canvases these approaches to date, with emphasis placed on the application of electronic structure theory to explore reactivity and electron transfer using periodic, molecular, and embedded models. This includes (i) computational chemistry considerations such as how functional, k-grid, and other model variables are selected to enable insights into MOF properties, (ii) extended solid models that treat MOFs as materials rather than molecules, (iii) the mechanics of cluster extraction and subsequent chemistry enabled by these molecular models, (iv) catalytic studies using both solids and clusters thereof, and (v) embedded, mixed-method approaches, which simulate a fraction of the material using one level of theory and the remainder of the material using another dissimilar theoretical implementation.","524":"DNA is traditionally known as a central genetic biomolecule in living systems. From an alternative perspective, DNA is a versatile molecular building-block for the construction of functional materials, in particular biomaterials, due to its intrinsic biological attributes, molecular recognition capability, sequence programmability, and biocompatibility.

Branched DNA recently has been extensively employed as a versatile building-block to synthesize new biomaterials, and an assortment of promising applications have been explored. In this review, we discuss the progress on DNA functional materials assembled from branched DNA. We first briefly introduce the background information on DNA molecules and sketch the development history of DNA functional materials constructed from branched DNA. In the second part, the synthetic strategies of branched DNA as building-blocks are categorized into base-pairing assembly and chemical bonding. In the third part, construction strategies for the branched DNA-based functional materials are comprehensively summarized including tile-mediated assembly, DNA origami, dynamic assembly, and hybrid assembly. In the fourth part, applications including diagnostics, protein engineering, drug and gene delivery, therapeutics, and cell engineering are demonstrated. In the end, an insight into the challenges and future perspectives is provided. We envision that branched DNA functional materials can not only enrich the DNA nanotechnology by ingenious design and synthesis but also promote the development of interdisciplinary fields in chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering, ultimately addressing the growing demands on biological and medical-related applications in the real world.","525":"The successful synthesis of noble-metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes offers many opportunities to not only maneuver their physicochemical properties but also optimize their figures of merit in a wide variety of applications.

The forecast of population growth over the next 3 decades is a very strong incentive for the identification of alternative primary resources other than petro-based ones. In contrast with fossil resources, renewable biomass is a virtually inexhaustible reservoir of chemical building blocks. Shifting the current industrial paradigm from almost exclusively petro-based resources to alternative bio-based raw materials requires more than vibrant political messages; it requires a profound revision of the concepts and technologies on which industrial chemical processes rely. Only a small fraction of molecules extracted from biomass bears significant chemical and commercial potentials to be considered as ubiquitous chemical platforms upon which a new, bio-based industry can thrive. Owing to its inherent assets in terms of unique process experience, scalability, and reduced environmental footprint, flow chemistry arguably has a major role to play in this context. This review covers a selection of C2 to C6 bio-based chemical platforms with existing commercial markets including polyols (ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, 1,4-butanediol, xylitol, and sorbitol), furanoids (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) and carboxylic acids (lactic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, itaconic acid, and levulinic acid).

Through chosen illustrative examples, we aim to show in this review that the cleavage of cyclopropane is a powerful approach to reveal sp3 stereocenters in acyclic systems. The application of these concepts was illustrated by the total syntheses of several natural products and other important molecules, further showing the power of these strategies as a powerful tool in organic synthesis.","530":"Energy and water are of fundamental importance for our modern society, and advanced technologies on sustainable energy storage and conversion as well as water resource management are in the focus of intensive research worldwide.

We then present an in-depth discussion of the structure-property relationships of hydrogel materials based on fundamental gelation chemistry, ultimately targeting properties such as enhanced ionic\/electronic conductivities, mechanical strength, flexibility, stimuli-responsiveness, and desirable swelling behavior. The unique interconnected porous structures of hydrogels enable fast charge\/mass transport while offering large surface areas, and the polymer-water interactions can be regulated to achieve desirable water retention, absorption, and evaporation within hydrogels. Such structure-derived properties are also intimately coordinated to realize multifunctionality and stability for different target devices. The plethora of stimulating examples is expounded with a focus on batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysts, solar water purification, and atmospheric water harvesting, which showcase the unprecedented technological potential enabled by hydrogels and hydrogel-derived materials.

They carry out the first step in the production of prostaglandins, important mediators of inflammation, pain, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and they are the molecular targets for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are among the oldest and most chemically diverse set of drugs known. Homodimeric proteins that behave as allosterically modulated, functional heterodimers, the cyclooxygenases exhibit complex kinetic behavior, requiring peroxide-dependent activation and undergoing suicide inactivation. Due to their important physiological and pathophysiological roles and keen interest on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, the cyclooxygenases have been the focus of a vast array of structural studies, leading to the publication of over 80 crystal structures of the enzymes in complex with substrates or inhibitors supported by a wealth of functional data generated by site-directed mutation experiments. In this review, we explore the chemical biology of the cyclooxygenases through the lens of this wealth of structural and functional information. We identify key structural features of the cyclooxygenases, break down their active site into regional binding pockets to facilitate comparisons between structures, and explore similarities and differences in the binding modes of the wide variety of ligands (both substrates and inhibitors) that have been characterized in complex with the enzymes. Throughout, we correlate structure with function whenever possible. Finally, we summarize what can and cannot be learned from the currently available structural data and discuss the critical intriguing questions that remain despite the wealth of information that has been amassed in this field.","536":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent the largest known class of porous crystalline materials ever synthesized.

With the emergence of several highly conductive solid electrolytes in recent years, the bottleneck is no longer Li-ion diffusion within the electrolyte. Instead, many ASSBs are limited by their low Coulombic efficiency, poor power performance, and short cycling life due to the high resistance at the interfaces within ASSBs. Because of the diverse chemical\/physical\/mechanical properties of various solid components in ASSBs as well as the nature of solid-solid contact, many types of interfaces are present in ASSBs. These include loose physical contact, grain boundaries, and chemical and electrochemical reactions to name a few. All of these contribute to increasing resistance at the interface. Here, we present the distinctive features of the typical interfaces and interphases in ASSBs and summarize the recent work on identifying, probing, understanding, and engineering them. We highlight the complicated, but important, characteristics of interphases, namely the composition, distribution, and electronic and ionic properties of the cathode-electrolyte and electrolyte-anode interfaces; understanding these properties is the key to designing a stable interface. In addition, conformal coatings to prevent side reactions and their selection criteria are reviewed. We emphasize the significant role of the mechanical behavior of the interfaces as well as the mechanical properties of all ASSB components, especially when the soft Li metal anode is used under constant stack pressure.

Over the past decade, various coherent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been developed and enabled researchers to study time-correlations of the fluctuating frequencies that are directly related to solute-solvent dynamics, dynamical changes in molecular conformations and local electrostatic environments, chemical and biochemical reactions, protein structural dynamics and functions, characteristic processes of functional materials, and so on. In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and interprotein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and site-specifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations. In addition, a brief introduction to a newly created repository Web site (http:\/\/frequencymap.org) for vibrational spectroscopic maps is presented. We anticipate that a combination of the vibrational frequency map approach and state-of-the-art multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy will be one of the most fruitful ways to study the structure and dynamics of chemical, biological, and functional molecular systems in the future.","540":"Organoborons have emerged as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis to achieve molecular diversity and as carboxylic acid bioisosteres with broad applicability in drug discovery.

Recent developments have provided new routes for the efficient preparation of organoborons by applying reactions using chemical feedstocks with leaving groups. As compared to the previous methods that used organic halides (I, Br, and Cl), the direct borylation of less reactive C-Het and C-C bonds has become highly important to get efficiency and functional-group compatibility.

This allows them to surpass the capacity limitations of electrical double-layer capacitors and the mass transfer limitations of batteries. The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the understanding of pseudocapacitance as well as materials that exhibit this phenomenon. The purpose of this Review is to examine the fundamental development of the concept of pseudocapacitance and how it came to prominence in electrochemical energy storage as well as to describe new classes of materials whose electrochemical energy storage behavior can be described as pseudocapacitive.","542":"Single-atom alloys (SAAs) play an increasingly significant role in the field of single-site catalysis and are typically composed of catalytically active elements atomically dispersed in more inert and catalytically selective host metals. SAAs have been shown to catalyze a range of industrially important reactions in electro-, photo-, and thermal catalysis studies. Due to the unique geometry of SAAs, the location of the transition state and the binding site of reaction intermediates are often decoupled, which can enable both facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates, two key factors for efficient and selective catalysis. Often, this results in deviations from transition metal scaling relationships that limit conventional catalysts. SAAs also offer reduced susceptibility to CO poisoning, cost savings from reduced precious metal usage, opportunities for bifunctional mechanisms via spillover, and higher resistance to deactivation by coking that plagues many industrial catalysts. In this review, we begin by introducing SAAs and describe how model systems and nanoparticle catalysts can be prepared and characterized. We then review all available SAA literature on a per reaction basis before concluding with a description of the general properties of this new class of heterogeneous catalysts and presenting opportunities for future research and development.","543":"Metal nanoparticles have drawn great attention in heterogeneous catalysis. One challenge is that they are easily deactivated by migration-coalescence during the catalysis process because of their high surface energy. With the rapid development of nanoscience, encapsulating metal nanoparticles in nanoshells or nanopores becomes one of the most promising strategies to overcome the stability issue of the metal nanoparticles. Besides, the activity and selectivity could be simultaneously enhanced by taking advantage of the synergy between the metal nanoparticles and the encapsulating materials as well as the molecular sieving property of the encapsulating materials. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the recent progress in the synthesis and catalytic properties of the encapsulated metal nanoparticles. This review begins with an introduction to the synthetic strategies for encapsulating metal nanoparticles with different architectures developed to date, including their encapsulation in nanoshells of inorganic oxides and carbon, porous materials (zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks), and organic capsules (dendrimers and organic cages). The advantages of the encapsulated metal nanoparticles are then discussed, such as enhanced stability and recyclability, improved selectivity, strong metal-support interactions, and the capability of enabling tandem catalysis, followed by the introduction of some representative applications of the encapsulated metal nanoparticles in thermo-, photo-, and electrocatalysis. At the end of this review, we discuss the remaining challenges associated with the encapsulated metal nanoparticles and provide our perspectives on the future development of the field.","544":"","545":"Chemical shifts present crucial information about an NMR spectrum. They show the influence of the chemical environment on the nuclei being probed. Relativistic effects caused by the presence of an atom of a heavy element in a compound can appreciably, even drastically, alter the NMR shifts of the nearby nuclei. A fundamental understanding of such relativistic effects on NMR shifts is important in many branches of chemical and physical science. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the tools, concepts, and periodic trends pertaining to the shielding effects by a neighboring heavy atom in diamagnetic systems, with particular emphasis on the \"spin-orbit heavy-atom effect on the light-atom\" NMR shift (SO-HALA effect). The analyses and tools described in this review provide guidelines to help NMR spectroscopists and computational chemists estimate the ranges of the NMR shifts for an unknown compound, identify intermediates in catalytic and other processes, analyze conformational aspects and intermolecular interactions, and predict trends in series of compounds throughout the Periodic Table. The present review provides a current snapshot of this important subfield of NMR spectroscopy and a basis and framework for including future findings in the field.","546":"This review summarizes synthetic developments reported from 1987 to 2019 that exploit C-C single bond cleavage of cyclopropylamine-based systems. The synthetic and mechanistic aspects of key methodologies are highlighted, and examples where aminocyclopropanes are exploited as key intermediates in multistep synthesis are also discussed. The review encompasses cases where aminocyclopropanes participate in polar reactions, pericyclic processes, radical-based reactions, and C-C bond activations.","547":"","548":"Since the emergence of the concept of chemical topology, interlocked molecular assemblies have graduated from academic curiosities and poorly defined species to become synthetic realities. Coordination-directed synthesis provides powerful, diverse, and increasingly sophisticated protocols for accessing interlocked molecules. Originally, metal ions were employed solely as templates to gather and position building blocks in entwined or threaded arrangements. Recently, metal centers have increasingly featured within the backbones of the integral structural elements, which in turn use noncovalent interactions to self-assemble into intricate topologies. By outlining ingenious recent examples as well as seminal classic cases, this Review focuses on the role of metal-ligand paradigms in assembling molecular links. In addition, the ever-evolving approaches to efficient assembly, the structural features of the resulting architectures, and their prospects for the future are also presented.","549":"The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has made numerous advances in recent years in the arena of fabricating multifunctional, three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs. This can be attributed to novel approaches in the bioprinting of stem cells. There are expansive options in bioprinting technology that have become more refined and specialized over the years, and stem cells address many limitations in cell source, expansion, and development of bioengineered tissue constructs. While bioprinted stem cells present an opportunity to replicate physiological microenvironments with precision, the future of this practice relies heavily on the optimization of the cellular microenvironment. To fabricate tissue constructs that are useful in replicating physiological conditions in laboratory settings, or in preparation for transplantation to a living host, the microenvironment must mimic conditions that allow bioprinted stem cells to proliferate, differentiate, and migrate. The advances of bioprinting stem cells and directing cell fate have the potential to provide feasible and translatable approach to creating complex tissues and organs. This review will examine the methods through which bioprinted stem cells are differentiated into desired cell lineages through biochemical, biological, and biomechanical techniques.","550":"Transition-metal-catalyzed decarbonylation via carbon-carbon bond cleavage is an essential synthetic methodology. Given the ubiquity of carbonyl compounds, the selective decarbonylative process offers a distinct synthetic strategy using carbonyl groups as \"traceless handles\". This reaction has been significantly developed in recent years in many respects, including catalytic system development, mechanistic understanding, substrate scope, and application in the synthesis of complex functional molecules. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the recent progress on transition-metal-catalyzed decarbonylative process, from the discovery of new transformations to the understanding of reaction mechanisms, to reveal the great achievements and potentials in this field. The contents of this review are categorized by the type of chemical bond cleavage in the decarbonylative process. The main challenges and opportunities of the decarbonylative process are also examined with the goal of expanding the application range of decarbonylation reactions.","551":"The properties of catenated nitrogen molecules, molecules containing internal chains of bonded nitrogen atoms, is of fundamental scientific interest in chemical structure and bonding, as nitrogen is uniquely situated in the periodic table to form kinetically stable compounds often with chemically stable N-N bonds but which are thermodynamically unstable in that the formation of stable multiply bonded N2 is usually thermodynamically preferable. This unique placement in the periodic table makes catenated nitrogen compounds of interest for development of high-energy-density materials, including explosives for defense and construction purposes, as well as propellants for missile propulsion and for space exploration. This review, designed for a chemical audience, describes foundational subjects, methods, and metrics relevant to the energetic materials community and provides an overview of important classes of catenated nitrogen compounds ranging from theoretical investigation of hypothetical molecules to the practical application of real-world energetic materials. The review is intended to provide detailed chemical insight into the synthesis and decomposition of such materials as well as foundational knowledge of energetic science new to most chemists.","552":"The reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia by nitrogenase reflects a complex choreography involving two component proteins, MgATP and reductant. At center stage of this process resides the active site cofactor, a complex metallocluster organized around a trigonal prismatic arrangement of iron sites surrounding an interstitial carbon. As a consequence of the choreography, electrons and protons are delivered to the active site for transfer to the bound N2. While the detailed mechanism for the substrate reduction remains enigmatic, recent developments highlight the role of hydrides and the privileged role for two irons of the trigonal prism in the binding of exogenous ligands. Outstanding questions concern the precise nature of the intermediates between N2 and NH3, and whether the cofactor undergoes significant rearrangement during turnover; resolution of these issues will require the convergence of biochemistry, structure, spectroscopy, computation, and model chemistry.","553":"Plasmonics is a rapidly growing field spanning research and applications across chemistry, physics, optics, energy harvesting, and medicine. Ultrafast photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has demonstrated unprecedented power in the characterization of surface plasmons and other electronic excitations, as it uniquely combines the requisite spatial and temporal resolution, making it ideally suited for 3D space and time coherent imaging of the dynamical plasmonic phenomena on the nanofemto scale. The ability to visualize plasmonic fields evolving at the local speed of light on subwavelength scale with optical phase resolution illuminates old phenomena and opens new directions for growth of plasmonics research. In this review, we guide the reader thorough experimental description of PEEM as a characterization tool for both surface plasmon polaritons and localized plasmons and summarize the exciting progress it has opened by the ultrafast imaging of plasmonic phenomena on the nanofemto scale.","554":"Nitrogen (N) is used in many of life's fundamental biomolecules, and it is also a participant in environmental redox chemistry. Biogeochemical processes control the amount and form of N available to organisms (\"fixed\" N). These interacting processes result in N acting as the proximate limiting nutrient in most surface environments. Here, we review the global biogeochemical cycle of N and its anthropogenic perturbation. We introduce important reservoirs and processes affecting N in the environment, focusing on the ocean, in which N cycling is more generalizable than in terrestrial systems, which are more heterogeneous. Particular attention is given to processes that create and destroy fixed N because these comprise the fixed N input\/output budget, the most universal control on environmental N availability. We discuss preindustrial N budgets for terrestrial and marine systems and their modern-day alteration by N inputs from human activities. We summarize evidence indicating that the simultaneous roles of N as a required biomass constituent and an environmental redox intermediate lead to stabilizing feedbacks that tend to blunt the impact of N cycle perturbations at larger spatiotemporal scales, particularly in marine systems. As a result of these feedbacks, the anthropogenic \"N problem\" is distinct from the \"carbon dioxide problem\" in being more local and less global, more immediate and less persistent.","555":"By combining metal nodes with organic linkers we can potentially synthesize millions of possible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues but also create new challenges. We simply have too many materials to be processed using conventional, brute force, methods. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We show how to select appropriate training sets, survey approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space, and review different learning architectures, as well as evaluation and interpretation strategies. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of machine learning have been applied to porous materials. In particular, we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials, their electronic properties, and their synthesis. Given the increasing interest of the scientific community in machine learning, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.","556":"As compared to porous network solids, including metal-organic frameworks, covalent-organic frameworks, porous aromatic frameworks, and zeolites, porous molecular materials are relatively unexplored. Additionally, within porous molecular space, porous organic cages (POCs) have been the most widely reported over the past decade. Relatively recently, however, porous hybrid metal-organic molecular complexes have received considerable attention with a large fraction of surface areas for these coordination cages reported over the past three years. This review focuses on advances in this area. We highlight the recent work with permanently microporous metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs). Analogous to early work in the area of MOFs, the vast majority of MOPs for which surface areas have been reported have been based on paddlewheel building units and carboxylate ligands. We describe the synthesis of porous cages and highlight those based on monometallic, bimetallic, trimetallic, tetrametallic, and higher nuclearity clusters. Finally, we showcase work wherein the porosity of MOPs has been leveraged for applications related to the storage and separation of small molecules and the incorporation of these porous and potentially porous cages into membranes.","557":"","558":"Alternative fuels are essential to enable the transition to a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply. Synthetic fuels derived from renewable energies can act as energy storage media, thus mitigating the effects of fossil fuels on environment and health. Their economic viability, environmental impact, and compatibility with current infrastructure and technologies are fuel and power source specific. Nitrogen-based fuels pose one possible synthetic fuel pathway. In this review, we discuss the progress and current research on utilization of nitrogen-based fuels in power applications, covering the complete fuel cycle. We cover the production, distribution, and storage of nitrogen-based fuels. We assess much of the existing literature on the reactions involved in the ammonia to nitrogen atom pathway in nitrogen-based fuel combustion. Furthermore, we discuss nitrogen-based fuel applications ranging from combustion engines to gas turbines, as well as their exploitation by suggested end-uses. Thereby, we evaluate the potential opportunities and challenges of expanding the role of nitrogen-based molecules in the energy sector, outlining their use as energy carriers in relevant fields.","559":"Recently, two rich and exciting research fields, layered two-dimensional (2D) materials and metamaterials, have started overlapping. Metamaterials are artificial, engineered materials with broad metaphotonic prospects such as negative refraction, perfect lensing, subwavelength imaging, and cloaking. The possibility of achieving metaphotonic properties using metamaterials based on layered 2D materials has been extensively exploited. Because they are highly tunable and adjustable with the ease of micro- and nanofabrication, 2D materials exhibit diverse optical properties such as natural negative refraction, natural anisotropic behavior, and even hyperbolic dispersion. A combination of 2D materials with conventional metamaterials promises a variety of prospective applications. In this review, we illustrate how the concept of metamaterials and their associated metaphotonic capabilities are naturally born in 2D materials. The multifunctionality of 2D materials may enable the manufacture of novel optical devices that work in a broad frequency range, from visible to terahertz, with particularly low loss, high speed, gated tunability, and miniaturized sizes. This new area of research links the fields of photonics, optoelectronics, and plasmonics with that of metamaterials and may provide insights to future innovations for 2D-material-inspired metaphotonic devices.","560":null,"561":"This review describes the development of enantioselective methods for the ring opening of cyclopropanes. Both approaches based on the reaction of nonchiral cyclopropanes and (dynamic) kinetic resolutions and asymmetric transformations of chiral substrates are presented. The review is organized according to substrate classes, starting by the more mature field of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes. Emerging methods for enantioselective ring opening of acceptor- or donor-only cyclopropanes are then presented. The last part of the review describes the ring opening of more reactive three-membered rings substituted with unsaturations with a particular focus on vinylcyclopropanes, alkylidenecyclopropanes, and vinylidenecyclopropanes. In the last two decades, the field has grown from a proof of concept stage to a broad range of methods for accessing enantioenriched building blocks, and further extensive developments can be expected in the future.","562":"Thermal C-C bond cleavage reactions allow the construction of structurally diverse molecular skeletons via predictable and efficient bond reorganizations. Visible light photoredox-catalyzed radical-mediated C-C bond cleavage reactions have recently emerged as a powerful alternative method for overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic barrier of C-C bond cleavage in diverse molecular scaffolds. In recent years, a plethora of elegant and useful reactions have been invented, and the products are sometimes otherwise inaccessible by classic thermal reactions. Considering the great influence and synthetic potential of these reactions, we provide a summary of the state of art visible light-driven radical-mediated C-C bond cleavage\/functionalization strategies with a specific emphasis on the working models. We hoped that this review will be useful for medicinal and synthetic organic chemists and will inspire further reaction development in this interesting area.","563":"Bioprinting is rapidly being adopted as a major method for fabricating tissue engineering constructs. Through the precise deposition of cell- and bioactive molecule-laden materials, bioprinting offers researchers a means to create biological constructs with enhanced spatial complexity that more closely mimics native tissue. The vast majority of materials used in bioprinting have been polymers due to their suitability toward resembling the cellular environment and the variety of methods available to process polymeric systems in ambient or relatively mild chemical and environmental conditions. In this review, we will discuss in detail the wide variety of natural and synthetic polymers that have been employed as inks in bioprinting. We will review recent bioprinting innovations, such as increasing architectural complexity and cell viability in heterogeneous tissue constructs, which allow for the investigation of biological questions that could not be addressed before. We will also survey nascent fields of study that promise to further advance the development of novel biofabrication technologies in the field, such as 4D bioprinting and the inclusion of nanomaterials. To conclude, we will examine some of the necessary steps that must take place to bring this technology to commercial markets and facilitate its use in clinical therapies.","564":"Global ammonia production reached 175 million metric tons in 2016, 90% of which is produced from high purity N2 and H2 gases at high temperatures and pressures via the Haber-Bosch process. Reliance on natural gas for H2 production results in large energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Concerns of human-induced climate change are spurring an international scientific effort to explore new approaches to ammonia production and reduce its carbon footprint. Electrocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia is an attractive alternative that can potentially enable ammonia synthesis under milder conditions in small-scale, distributed, and on-site electrolysis cells powered by renewable electricity generated from solar or wind sources. This review provides a comprehensive account of theoretical and experimental studies on electrochemical nitrogen fixation with a focus on the low selectivity for reduction of N2 to ammonia versus protons to H2. A detailed introduction to ammonia detection methods and the execution of control experiments is given as they are crucial to the accurate reporting of experimental findings. The main part of this review focuses on theoretical and experimental progress that has been achieved under a range of conditions. Finally, comments on current challenges and potential opportunities in this field are provided.","565":"Transition metal-sulfur (M-S) compounds are an indispensable means for biological systems to convert N2 into NH3 (biological N2 fixation), and these may have emerged by chemical evolution from a prebiotic N2 fixation system. With a main focus on synthetic species, this article provides a comprehensive review of the chemistry of M-S compounds related to the conversion of N2 and the structures\/functions of the nitrogenase cofactors. Three classes of M-S compounds are highlighted here: multinuclear M-S clusters structurally or functionally relevant to the nitrogenase cofactors, mono- and dinuclear transition metal complexes supported by sulfur-containing ligands in N2 and N2Hx (x = 2, 4) chemistry, and metal sulfide-based solid materials employed in the reduction of N2. Fair assessments on these classes of compounds revealed that our understanding is still limited in N2 reduction and related substrate reductions. Our aims of this review are to compile a collection of studies performed at atomic to mesoscopic scales and to present potential opportunities for elucidating the roles of metal and sulfur atoms in the biological N2 fixation that might be helpful for the development of functional materials.","566":"The functionalization of coordinated dinitrogen to form nitrogen-element bonds en route to nitrogen-containing molecules is a long-standing challenge in chemical synthesis. The strong triple bond and the nonpolarity of the N2 molecule pose thermodynamic and kinetic challenges for promoting reactivity. While heterogeneous, homogeneous, and biological catalysts are all known for catalytic nitrogen fixation to ammonia, the catalytic synthesis of more complicated nitrogen-containing organic molecules has far less precedent. The example of silyl radical additions to coordinated nitrogen to form silylamines stands as the lone example of a catalytic reaction involving N2 to form a product other than ammonia. This Review surveys the field of molecular transition metal complexes as well as recent boron examples for the formation of nitrogen-element bonds. Emphasis is placed on the coordination and activation modes of N2 in the various metal compounds from across the transition series and how these structures can rationally inform reactivity studies. Over the past few decades, the field has evolved from the addition of carbon electrophiles in a manner similar to that of protonation reactions to more organometallic-inspired reactivity, including insertions, 1,2-additions, and cycloadditions. Various N-C, N-Si, and N-B bond-forming reactions have been discovered, highlighting that the challenge for catalytic chemistry is not in the reactivity of coordinated dinitrogen but rather removal of the functionalized ligand from the coordination sphere of the metal.","567":"Fungal infections are a major contributor to infectious disease-related deaths across the globe. Candida species are among the most common causes of invasive mycotic disease, with Candida albicans reigning as the leading cause of invasive candidiasis. Given that fungi are eukaryotes like their human host, the number of unique molecular targets that can be exploited for antifungal development remains limited. Currently, there are only three major classes of drugs approved for the treatment of invasive mycoses, and the efficacy of these agents is compromised by the development of drug resistance in pathogen populations. Notably, the emergence of additional drug-resistant species, such as Candida auris and Candida glabrata, further threatens the limited armamentarium of antifungals available to treat these serious infections. Here, we describe our current arsenal of antifungals and elaborate on the resistance mechanisms Candida species possess that render them recalcitrant to therapeutic intervention. Finally, we highlight some of the most promising therapeutic strategies that may help combat antifungal resistance, including combination therapy, targeting fungal-virulence traits, and modulating host immunity. Overall, a thorough understanding of the mechanistic principles governing antifungal drug resistance is fundamental for the development of novel therapeutics to combat current and emerging fungal threats.","568":"Covalent polymers connected by non-covalent interactions constitute a fascinating set of materials known as supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs). A key feature of SPNs is that the underlying covalent polymers endow the resulting self-assembled materials with features, such as structural and mechanical integrity, good processability, recyclability, stimuli-responsiveness, self-healing, and shape memory, that are not recapitulated in the case of classic covalent polymer systems. The unique nature of SPNs derives from the controlled marriage of traditional covalent polymers and macrocycle-based host-guest interactions. As a consequence, supramolecular polymeric networks have played important roles in a number of diverse fields, including polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, materials science, biomedical materials, and information storage technology. In this Review, we summarize advances made in the area of functional SPNs, with a focus on original literature reports appearing in the past five years. The treatment is organized according to the key macrocycle-based host-guest interactions used to produce various SPNs. The role of the underlying polymer backbones is also discussed.","569":"The origin of nucleotides is a major question in origins-of-life research. Given the central importance of RNA in biology and the influential RNA World hypothesis, a great deal of this research has focused on finding possible prebiotic syntheses of the four canonical nucleotides of coding RNA. However, the use of nucleotides in other roles across the tree of life might be evidence that nucleotides have been used in noncoding roles for even longer than RNA has been used as a genetic polymer. Likewise, it is possible that early life utilized nucleotides other than the extant nucleotides as the monomers of informational polymers. Therefore, finding plausible prebiotic syntheses of potentially ancestral noncanonical nucleotides may be of great importance for understanding the origins and early evolution of life. Experimental investigations into abiotic noncanonical nucleotide synthesis reveal that many noncanonical nucleotides and related glycosides are formed much more easily than the canonical nucleotides. An analysis of the mechanisms by which nucleosides and nucleotides form in the solution phase or in drying-heating reactions from pre-existing sugars and heterocycles suggests that a wide variety of noncanonical nucleotides and related glycosides would have been present on the prebiotic Earth, if any such molecules were present.","570":"The steep stepwise uptake of water vapor and easy release at low relative pressures and moderate temperatures together with high working capacities make metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) attractive, promising materials for energy efficient applications in adsorption devices for humidity control (evaporation and condensation processes) and heat reallocation (heating and cooling) by utilizing water as benign sorptive and low-grade renewable or waste heat. Emerging MOF-based process applications covered are desiccation, heat pumps\/chillers, water harvesting, air conditioning, and desalination. Governing parameters of the intrinsic sorption properties and stability under humid conditions and cyclic operation are identified. Transport of mass and heat in MOF structures, at least as important, is still an underexposed topic. Essential engineering elements of operation and implementation are presented. An update on stability of MOFs in water vapor and liquid systems is provided, and a suite of 18 MOFs are identified for selective use in heat pumps and chillers, while several can be used for air conditioning, water harvesting, and desalination. Most applications with MOFs are still in an exploratory state. An outlook is given for further R&amp;D to realize these applications, providing essential kinetic parameters, performing smart engineering in the design of systems, and conceptual process designs to benchmark them against existing technologies. A concerted effort bridging chemistry, materials science, and engineering is required.","571":"Bioprinting techniques have been flourishing in the field of biofabrication with pronounced and exponential developments in the past years. Novel biomaterial inks used for the formation of bioinks have been developed, allowing the manufacturing of in vitro models and implants tested preclinically with a certain degree of success. Furthermore, incredible advances in cell biology, namely, in pluripotent stem cells, have also contributed to the latest milestones where more relevant tissues or organ-like constructs with a certain degree of functionality can already be obtained. These incredible strides have been possible with a multitude of multidisciplinary teams around the world, working to make bioprinted tissues and organs more relevant and functional. Yet, there is still a long way to go until these biofabricated constructs will be able to reach the clinics. In this review, we summarize the main bioprinting activities linking them to tissue and organ development and physiology. Most bioprinting approaches focus on mimicking fully matured tissues. Future bioprinting strategies might pursue earlier developmental stages of tissues and organs. The continuous convergence of the experts in the fields of material sciences, cell biology, engineering, and many other disciplines will gradually allow us to overcome the barriers identified on the demanding path toward manufacturing and adoption of tissue and organ replacements.","572":"Solid-state proton conductors (SSPCs), which are a key component for the safety and efficiency of fuel cells, have received much attention due to their broad application in electrochemical devices. In particular, the development of new materials with high conducting performance and an understanding of the conduction mechanism have become critical issues in this field. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have recently emerged and have been extensively studied as a new type of proton conductor due to their crystallinity, designability, and high porosity. These properties are able to adsorb the guest molecules working as conducting media. During the past decade, major advances in proton-conductive MOFs have been achieved with high performance (&gt;10-2 S cm-1), comparable to the conventional material, via various synthetic strategies, and the veiled conduction mechanism has been elucidated through structure analysis and spectroscopy tools such as NMR, X-ray diffraction, and neutron scattering measurement. This Review aims to summarize and provide a comprehensive understanding of proton transport in MOFs. Here, we discuss the fundamental principles and various design strategies and implementations aimed at enhancing proton conductivity with representative examples. We also deal with characterization methods used to investigate proton-conductive MOFs and computational\/theoretical studies that aid in understanding the conduction mechanism. Finally, future endeavors are suggested regarding the challenges of research for practical SSPCs.","573":null,"574":null,"575":"Activation of dinitrogen plays an important role in daily anthropogenic life, and the processes by which this fixation occurs have been a longstanding and significant research focus within the community. One of the major fields of dinitrogen activation research is the use of multimetallic compounds to reduce and\/or activate N2 into a more useful nitrogen-atom source, such as ammonia. Here we report a comprehensive review of multimetallic-dinitrogen complexes and their utility toward N2 activation, beginning with the d-block metals from Group 4 to Group 11, then extending to Group 13 (which is exclusively populated by B complexes), and finally the rare-earth and actinide species. The review considers all polynuclear metal aggregates containing two or more metal centers in which dinitrogen is coordinated or activated (i.e., partial or complete cleavage of the N2 triple bond in the observed product). Our survey includes complexes in which mononuclear N2 complexes are used as building blocks to generate homo- or heteromultimetallic dinitrogen species, which allow one to evaluate the potential of heterometallic species for dinitrogen activation. We highlight some of the common trends throughout the periodic table, such as the differences between coordination modes as it relates to N2 activation and potential functionalization and the effect of polarizing the bridging N2 ligand by employing different metal ions of differing Lewis acidities. By providing this comprehensive treatment of polynuclear metal dinitrogen species, this Review aims to outline the past and provide potential future directions for continued research in this area.","576":"For many years, an extensive array of chemometric methods have provided a platform upon which a quantitative description of environmental conditions can be obtained. Applying chemometric methods to environmental data allows us to identify and describe the interrelations between certain environmental drivers. They also provide an insight into the interrelationships between these drivers and afford us a greater understanding of the potential impact that these drivers can place upon the environment. However, an effective marriage of these two systems has not been performed. Therefore, it is the aim of this review to highlight the advantages of using chemometrics and sensors to identify hidden trends in environmental parameters, which allow the state of the environment to be effectively monitored. Despite the combination of chemometrics and sensors, to capture new developments and applications in the field of environmental sciences, these methods have not been extensively used. Importantly, although different parameters and monitoring procedures are required for different environments (e.g., air, water, soil), they are not distinct, separate entities. Contemporary developments in the use of chemometrics afford us the ability to predict changes in different aspects of the environment using instrumental methods. This review also provides an insight into the prevailing trends and the future of environmental sensing, highlighting that chemometrics can be used to enhance our ability to monitor the environment. This enhanced ability to monitor environmental conditions and to predict trends would be beneficial to government and research agencies in their ability to develop environmental policies and analysis procedures.","577":"This comprehensive critical review combines, for the first time, recent advances in nanoscale surface chemistry, surface science, DFT, adsorption calorimetry, and in situ XRD and TEM to provide new insights into catalyst sintering. This work provides qualitative and quantitative estimates of the extent and rate of sintering as functions of nanocrystal (NC) size, temperature, and atmosphere. This review is unique in that besides summarizing important, useful data from previous studies, it also advances the field through addition of (i) improved or new models, (ii) new data summarized in original tables and figures, and (iii) new fundamental perspectives into sintering of supported metals and particularly of chemical sintering of supported Co during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. We demonstrate how the two widely accepted sintering mechanisms are largely sequential with some overlap and highly NC-size dependent, i.e., generally, small NCs sinter rapidly by Ostwald ripening, while larger NCs sinter slowly by crystallite migration and coalescence. In addition, we demonstrate how accumulated knowledge, principles, and recent advances, discussed in this review, can be utilized in the design of supported metal NCs highly resistant to sintering. Recommendations for improving the design of sintering experiments and for new research are addressed.","578":"While the Staudinger reaction has first been described a hundred years ago in 1919, the ligation reaction became one of the most important and efficient bioconjugation techniques in the 1990s and this century. It holds the crucial characteristics for bioorthogonal chemistry: biocompatibility, selectivity, and a rapid and high-yielding turnover for a wide variety of applications. In the past years, it has been used especially in chemical biology for peptide\/protein synthesis, posttranslational modifications, and DNA labeling. Furthermore, it can be used for cell-surface engineering, development of microarrays, and drug delivery systems. However, it is also possible to use the reaction in synthetic chemistry for general formation of amide bonds. In this review, the three major types, traceless and nontraceless Staudinger Ligation as well as the Staudinger phosphite reaction, are described in detail. We will further illustrate each reaction mechanism and describe characteristic substrates, intermediates, and products. In addition, not only its advantages but also stereochemical aspects, scope, and limitations, in particular side reactions, are discussed. Finally, the method is compared to other bioorthogonal labeling methods.","579":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of distinctive porous crystalline materials constructed by metal ions\/clusters and organic linkers. Owing to their structural diversity, functional adjustability, and high surface area, different types of MOF-based single metal sites are well exploited, including coordinately unsaturated metal sites from metal nodes and metallolinkers, as well as active metal species immobilized to MOFs. Furthermore, controllable thermal transformation of MOFs can upgrade them to nanomaterials functionalized with active single-atom catalysts (SACs). These unique features of MOFs and their derivatives enable them to serve as a highly versatile platform for catalysis, which has actually been becoming a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area. In this review, we overview the recent developments of catalysis at single metal sites in MOF-based materials with emphasis on their structures and applications for thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. We also compare the results and summarize the major insights gained from the works in this review, providing the challenges and prospects in this emerging field.","580":"Nitrogen fixation, the six-electron\/six-proton reduction of N2, to give NH3, is one of the most challenging and important chemical transformations. Notwithstanding the barriers associated with this reaction, significant progress has been made in developing molecular complexes that reduce N2 into its bioavailable form, NH3. This progress is driven by the dual aims of better understanding biological nitrogenases and improving upon industrial nitrogen fixation. In this review, we highlight both mechanistic understanding of nitrogen fixation that has been developed, as well as advances in yields, efficiencies, and rates that make molecular alternatives to nitrogen fixation increasingly appealing. We begin with a historical discussion of N2 functionalization chemistry that traverses a timeline of events leading up to the discovery of the first bona fide molecular catalyst system and follow with a comprehensive overview of d-block compounds that have been targeted as catalysts up to and including 2019. We end with a summary of lessons learned from this significant research effort and last offer a discussion of key remaining challenges in the field.","581":"Chiral sulfinyl compounds, sulfoxides, sulfoximines, sulfinamides, and other derivatives, play an important role in asymmetric synthesis as versatile auxiliaries, ligands, and catalysts. They are also recognized as pharmacophores found in already marketed and well-sold drugs (e.g., esomeprazole) and used in drug design. This review is devoted to the modern methods of preparation of sulfinyl derivatives in enantiopure or enantiomerically enriched form. Selected new approaches leading to racemic products for which the asymmetric variant can be developed in the future are mentioned as well.","582":"Ion transport in crystalline fast ionic conductors is a complex physical phenomenon. Certain ionic species (e.g., Ag+, Cu+, Li+, F-, O2-, H+) in a solid crystalline framework can move as fast as in liquids. This property, although only observed in a limited number of materials, is a key enabler for a broad range of technologies, including batteries, fuel cells, and sensors. However, the mechanisms of ion transport in the crystal lattice of fast ionic conductors are still not fully understood despite the substantial progress achieved in the last 40 years, partly because of the wide range of length and time scales involved in the complex migration processes of ions in solids. Without a comprehensive understanding of these ion transport mechanisms, the rational design of new fast ionic conductors is not possible. In this review, we cover classical and emerging characterization techniques (both experimental and computational) that can be used to investigate ion transport processes in bulk crystalline inorganic materials which exhibit predominant ion conduction (i.e., negligible electronic conductivity) with a primary focus on literature published after 2000 and critically assess their strengths and limitations. Together with an overview of recent understanding, we highlight the need for a combined experimental and computational approach to study ion transport in solids of desired time and length scales and for precise measurements of physical parameters related to ion transport.","583":"Natural products containing eight-membered carbocycles constitute a class of structurally intriguing and biologically important molecules such as the famous diterpenes taxol and vinigrol. Such natural products are being increasingly investigated because of their fascinating architectural features and potent medicinal properties. However, synthesis of natural products with cyclooctane moieties has proved to be highly challenging. This review highlights the recently completed total syntheses of natural products with eight-membered carbocycles with a focus on strategic considerations. A collection of 27 representative studies from the literature covering the decade from 2009 to 2019 is described in chronological order with relevant studies grouped together, including syntheses of the same natural product by different research groups using different strategies. Finally, a summary and outlook including a discussion of the major features of each strategy used in the syntheses are presented. This review illustrates the diversity and creativity in the elegant synthetic designs of eight-membered carbocycles. We hope this review will provide timely illumination and beneficial guidance for future synthetic efforts for organic chemists who are interested in this area.","584":"Since the advent of additive manufacturing, known commonly as 3D printing, this technology has revolutionized the biofabrication landscape and driven numerous pivotal advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Many 3D printing methods were developed in short course after Charles Hull first introduced the power of stereolithography to the world. However, materials development was not met with the same enthusiasm and remained the bottleneck in the field for some time. Only in the past decade has there been deliberate development to expand the materials toolbox for 3D printing applications to meet the true potential of 3D printing technologies. Herein, we review the development of biomaterials suited for light-based 3D printing modalities with an emphasis on bioprinting applications. We discuss the chemical mechanisms that govern photopolymerization and highlight the application of natural, synthetic, and composite biomaterials as 3D printed hydrogels. Because the quality of a 3D printed construct is highly dependent on both the material properties and processing technique, we included a final section on the theoretical and practical aspects behind light-based 3D printing as well as ways to employ that knowledge to troubleshoot and standardize the optimization of printing parameters.","585":"","586":"Proteins adopt different higher-order structures (HOS) to enable their unique biological functions. Understanding the complexities of protein higher-order structures and dynamics requires integrated approaches, where mass spectrometry (MS) is now positioned to play a key role. One of those approaches is protein footprinting. Although the initial demonstration of footprinting was for the HOS determination of protein\/nucleic acid binding, the concept was later adapted to MS-based protein HOS analysis, through which different covalent labeling approaches \"mark\" the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of proteins to reflect protein HOS. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX), where deuterium in D2O replaces hydrogen of the backbone amides, is the most common example of footprinting. Its advantage is that the footprint reflects SASA and hydrogen bonding, whereas one drawback is the labeling is reversible. Another example of footprinting is slow irreversible labeling of functional groups on amino acid side chains by targeted reagents with high specificity, probing structural changes at selected sites. A third footprinting approach is by reactions with fast, irreversible labeling species that are highly reactive and footprint broadly several amino acid residue side chains on the time scale of submilliseconds. All of these covalent labeling approaches combine to constitute a problem-solving toolbox that enables mass spectrometry as a valuable tool for HOS elucidation. As there has been a growing need for MS-based protein footprinting in both academia and industry owing to its high throughput capability, prompt availability, and high spatial resolution, we present a summary of the history, descriptions, principles, mechanisms, and applications of these covalent labeling approaches. Moreover, their applications are highlighted according to the biological questions they can answer. This review is intended as a tutorial for MS-based protein HOS elucidation and as a reference for investigators seeking a MS-based tool to address structural questions in protein science.","587":"Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) is a nanofabrication technique that can be used to directly write molecular patterns on substrates with high resolution and registration. Over the past two decades, DPN has evolved in its ability to transport molecular and material \"inks\" (e.g., alkanethiols, biological molecules like DNA, viruses, and proteins, polymers, and nanoparticles) to many surfaces in a high-throughput fashion, enabling the synthesis and study of complex chemical and biological structures. In addition, DPN has laid the foundation for a series of related scanning probe methodologies, for example, polymer pen lithography (PPL), scanning probe block copolymer lithography (SPBCL), and beam-pen lithography (BPL), which do not rely on cantilever tips. Structures prepared with these methodologies have been used to understand the consequences of miniaturization and open a door to new capabilities in catalysis, optics, biomedicine, and chemical synthesis, where, in sum, a process originally intended to compete with tools used by the semiconductor industry for rapid prototyping has transcended that application to advanced materials discovery. This review outlines the major DPN advances, the subsequent methods based on the technique, and the opportunities for future fundamental and technological exploration. Most importantly, it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the discovery of DPN.","588":"","589":"","590":"Reticular chemistry has proven as a notable\/distinctive discipline aimed at the deliberate assembly of periodic solids, offering great opportunities to effectively deploy the gained knowledge on net-topologies as a guide and toolbox for designed syntheses, based on the assembly of molecular building blocks into targeted and anticipated structures of crystalline extended solids. The effective practice of reticular chemistry has enriched the repertoire of crystal chemistry and afforded notable accelerating development of crystalline extended frameworks, especially metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Here, we review a special class of trinodal MOF structures based on the reticulation of special minimal edge-transitive nets (nets with transitivity [3 2], three distinct nodes and two kind of edges) derived from edge-transitive nets (one kind of edge). The rationale for deriving these special minimal edge-transitive nets is reviewed, and their associated net-coded building (net-cBUs) for the design of trinodal MOFs is presented and discussed. The resultant inclusive list of the enumerated minimal edge-transitive nets provides a unique toolbox for the material's designer as it offers ideal blueprints for the deliberate design and rational assembly of building blocks with embedded multiple branch points into intricate trinodal MOFs.","591":"This review provides a detailed overview of the rapidly advancing field of biofabrication, particularly with regards to the use of photo-cross-linking (i.e., light-based) techniques. The major emphasis of this review is on the fundamentals of photo-cross-linking and key criteria identified for the successful design and implementation of photo-cross-linked bioinks and bioresins in extrusion-based and lithography-based bioprinting. The general mechanisms associated with photo-cross-linking (e.g., free-radical chain polymerization, thiol-ene, photomediated redox) of natural and synthetic materials are described to inform bioink and bioresin design, which includes the selection of polymers, functional group modifications, photoinitiators, and light sources that enable facile and cytocompatible photo-cross-linking. Depending on material selection and the bioprinting technique of interest, we describe the specific bioink or bioresin properties and criteria that must be achieved to ensure optimal printability and utility. Finally, examples of current state-of-the-art applications of light-based bioprinting for in vitro tissue models, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine are provided to further motivate future opportunities within the bioprinting landscape that are facilitated with light.","592":"Ionic liquids (ILs) are a special category of molten salts solely composed of ions with varied molecular symmetry and charge delocalization. The versatility in combining varied cation-anion moieties and in functionalizing ions with different atoms and molecular groups contributes to their peculiar interactions ranging from weak isotropic associations to strong, specific, and anisotropic forces. A delicate interplay among intra- and intermolecular interactions facilitates the formation of heterogeneous microstructures and liquid morphologies, which further contributes to their striking dynamical properties. Microstructural and dynamical heterogeneities of ILs lead to their multifaceted properties described by an inherent designer feature, which makes ILs important candidates for novel solvents, electrolytes, and functional materials in academia and industrial applications. Due to a massive number of combinations of ion pairs with ion species having distinct molecular structures and IL mixtures containing varied molecular solvents, a comprehensive understanding of their hierarchical structural and dynamical quantities is of great significance for a rational selection of ILs with appropriate properties and thereafter advancing their macroscopic functionalities in applications. In this review, we comprehensively trace recent advances in understanding delicate interplay of strong and weak interactions that underpin their complex phase behaviors with a particular emphasis on understanding heterogeneous microstructures and dynamics of ILs in bulk liquids, in mixtures with cosolvents, and in interfacial regions.","593":"Sugars are abundant natural sources existing in biological systems, and bioactive saccharides have attracted much more attention in the field of biochemistry and biomaterials. For better understanding of the sugar-based biomaterials and biological sciences, aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIE-gens) have been widely employed for detection, tracing, and imaging. This review covers the applications of AIE molecules on sugar-based biomaterials by three parts, polysaccharide, oligosaccharide, and monosaccharide, mainly focusing on saccharide detection, stimuli response materials preparation, bioimaging, and study of the AIE mechanism. These excellent works suggest the promising future of the sugar-based AIE bioconjugates, considering that the naturally designed and elaborately functionalized saccharides play discriminate roles in biological processes and AIE-tagged species may work as an indicator in each case. However, there are a lot of sugar-based biological species that have not been touched, such as mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins on the cell surface and in the cell plasma. Based on these features, we enthusiastically look forward to more glorious developments in this bright research area.","594":null,"595":null,"596":"We review oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of both molecules and solids. We start with an overview of the main experimental aspects of oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption measurements including X-ray sources, monochromators, and detection schemes. Many recent oxygen K-edge studies combine X-ray absorption with time and spatially resolved measurements and\/or operando conditions. The main theoretical and conceptual approximations for the simulation of oxygen K-edges are discussed in the Theory section. We subsequently discuss oxygen atoms and ions, binary molecules, water, and larger molecules containing oxygen, including biomolecular systems. The largest part of the review deals with the experimental results for solid oxides, starting from s- and p-electron oxides. Examples of theoretical simulations for these oxides are introduced in order to show how accurate a DFT description can be in the case of s and p electron overlap. We discuss the general analysis of the 3d transition metal oxides including discussions of the crystal field effect and the effects and trends in oxidation state and covalency. In addition to the general concepts, we give a systematic overview of the oxygen K-edges element by element, for the s-, p-, d-, and f-electron systems.","597":"Solid-state batteries with desirable advantages, including high-energy density, wide temperature tolerance, and fewer safety-concerns, have been considered as a promising energy storage technology to replace organic liquid electrolyte-dominated Li-ion batteries. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) as the most critical component in solid-state batteries largely lead the future battery development. Among different types of solid-state electrolytes, garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolytes have particularly high ionic conductivity (10-3 to 10-4 S\/cm) and good chemical stability against Li metal, offering a great opportunity for solid-state Li-metal batteries. Since the discovery of garnet-type LLZO in 2007, there has been an increasing interest in the development of garnet-type solid-state electrolytes and all solid-state batteries. Garnet-type electrolyte has been considered one of the most promising and important solid-state electrolytes for batteries with potential benefits in energy density, electrochemical stability, high temperature stability, and safety. In this Review, we will survey recent development of garnet-type LLZO electrolytes with discussions of experimental studies and theoretical results in parallel, LLZO electrolyte synthesis strategies and modifications, stability of garnet solid electrolytes\/electrodes, emerging nanostructure designs, degradation mechanisms and mitigations, and battery architectures and integrations. We will also provide a target-oriented research overview of garnet-type LLZO electrolyte and its application in various types of solid-state battery concepts (e.g., Li-ion, Li-S, and Li-air), and we will show opportunities and perspectives as guides for future development of solid electrolytes and solid-state batteries.","598":"Fast ion conduction in solid-state matrices constitutes the foundation for a wide spectrum of electrochemical systems that use solid electrolytes (SEs), examples of which include solid-state batteries (SSBs), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and diversified gas sensors. Mixing different solid conductors to form composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) introduces unique opportunities for SEs to possess exceptional overall performance far superior to their individual parental solids, thanks to the abundant chemistry and physics at the new interfaces thus created. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth examination of the development and understanding of CSEs for SSBs, with special focus on their physiochemical properties and mechanisms of ion transport therein. The origin of the enhanced ionic conductivity in CSEs relative to their single-phase parents is discussed in the context of defect chemistry and interfacial reactions. The models\/theories for ion movement in diversified composites are critically reviewed to interrogate a general strategy to the design of novel CSEs, while properties such as mechanical strength and electrochemical stability are discussed in view of their perspective applications in lithium metal batteries and beyond. As an integral component of understanding how ions interact with their composite environments, characterization techniques to probe the ion transport kinetics across different temporal and spatial time scales are also summarized.","599":"","600":null,"601":"Manipulating metal atoms in a controllable way for the synthesis of materials with the desired structure and properties is the holy grail of chemical synthesis. The recent emergence of single atomic site catalysts (SASC) demonstrates that we are moving toward this goal. Owing to the maximum efficiency of atom-utilization and unique structures and properties, SASC have attracted extensive research attention and interest. The prerequisite for the scientific research and practical applications of SASC is to fabricate highly reactive and stable metal single atoms on appropriate supports. In this review, various synthetic strategies for the synthesis of SASC are summarized with concrete examples highlighting the key issues of the synthesis methods to stabilize single metal atoms on supports and to suppress their migration and agglomeration. Next, we discuss how synthesis conditions affect the structure and catalytic properties of SASC before ending this review by highlighting the prospects and challenges for the synthesis as well as further scientific researches and practical applications of SASC.","602":"Multireference electron correlation methods describe static and dynamical electron correlation in a balanced way and, therefore, can yield accurate and predictive results even when single-reference methods or multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory fails. One of their most prominent applications in quantum chemistry is the exploration of potential energy surfaces. This includes the optimization of molecular geometries, such as equilibrium geometries and conical intersections and on-the-fly photodynamics simulations, both of which depend heavily on the ability of the method to properly explore the potential energy surface. Because such applications require nuclear gradients and derivative couplings, the availability of analytical nuclear gradients greatly enhances the scope of quantum chemical methods. This review focuses on the developments and advances made in the past two decades. A detailed account of the analytical nuclear gradient and derivative coupling theories is presented. Emphasis is given to the software infrastructure that allows one to make use of these methods. Notable applications of multireference electron correlation methods to chemistry, including geometry optimizations and on-the-fly dynamics, are summarized at the end followed by a discussion of future prospects.","603":null,"604":"Nitrogenases are responsible for biological nitrogen fixation, a crucial step in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. These enzymes utilize a two-component protein system and a series of iron-sulfur clusters to perform this reaction, culminating at the FeMco active site (M = Mo, V, Fe), which is capable of binding and reducing N2 to 2NH3. In this review, we summarize how different spectroscopic approaches have shed light on various aspects of these enzymes, including their structure, mechanism, alternative reactivity, and maturation. Synthetic model chemistry and theory have also played significant roles in developing our present understanding of these systems and are discussed in the context of their contributions to interpreting the nature of nitrogenases. Despite years of significant progress, there is still much to be learned from these enzymes through spectroscopic means, and we highlight where further spectroscopic investigations are needed.","605":"Despite the generally hostile nature of the environments involved, chemistry does occur in space. Molecules are seen in environments that span a wide range of physical and chemical conditions and that clearly were created by a multitude of chemical processes, many of which differ substantially from those associated with traditional equilibrium chemistry. The wide range of environmental conditions and processes involved with chemistry in space yields complex populations of materials, and because the elements H, C, O, and N are among the most abundant in the universe, many of these are organic in nature, including some of direct astrobiological interest. Much of this chemistry occurs in \"dense\" interstellar clouds and protostellar disks surrounding forming stars because these environments have higher relative densities and more benign radiation fields than in stellar ejectae or the diffuse interstellar medium. Because these are the environments in which new planetary systems form, some of the chemical species made in these environments are expected to be delivered to the surfaces of planets where they can potentially play key roles in the origin of life. Because these chemical processes are universal and should occur in these environments wherever they are found, this implies that some of the starting materials for life are likely to be widely distributed throughout the universe.","606":"More than 95% (in volume) of all of today's chemical products are manufactured through catalytic processes, making research into more efficient catalytic materials a thrilling and very dynamic research field. In this regard, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer great opportunities for the rational design of new catalytic solids, as highlighted by the unprecedented number of publications appearing over the past decade. In this review, the recent advances in the application of MOFs in heterogeneous catalysis are discussed. MOFs with intrinsic thermocatalytic activity, as hosts for the incorporation of metal nanoparticles, as precursors for the manufacture of composite catalysts and those active in photo- and electrocatalytic processes are critically reviewed.

The role of support is then discussed in relation to the catalytic properties of Au-based monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles using different gas phase and liquid phase reactions. The reactions discussed include CO oxidation, aerobic oxidation of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols, selective hydrogenation of alkynes, hydrogenation of nitroaromatics, CO2 hydrogenation, C-C coupling, and methane oxidation. Only studies where the role of support has been explicitly studied in detail have been selected for discussion. However, the role of support is also examined using examples of reactions involving unsupported metal nanoparticles (i.e., colloidal nanoparticles). It is clear that the support functionality can play a crucial role in tuning the catalytic activity that is observed and that advanced theory and characterization add greatly to our understanding of these fascinating catalysts.","608":"Mediated fuel cells are electrochemical devices that produce power in a manner similar to that of conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). They differ from PEMFCs in their use of redox mediators dissolved in liquid electrolyte to conduct oxidation of the fuel or reduction of the oxidant, typically O2, in bulk solution. The mediators transport electrons (and often protons) between the electrode and the catalysts or chemical reagents in solution. This strategy can help overcome many of the challenges associated with conventional fuel cells, including managing complex multiphase reactions (as in O2 reduction) or the use of challenging or heterogeneous fuels, such as hydrocarbons, polyols, and biomass. Mediators are also commonly used in enzymatic fuel cells, where direct electron transfer from the electrode to the enzymatic active site can be slow. This review provides a comprehensive survey of historical and recent mediated fuel cell efforts, including applications using chemical and enzymatic catalysts.","609":"In recent years, the self-assembly of copolymer micelles has become an appealing frontier of supramolecular chemistry as a strategy to construct superstructures with multiple levels of complexity. The assembly of copolymer micelles is a form of higher-level self-assembly occurring at the nanoscale level where the building blocks are preassembled micelles. Compared to one-step hierarchical self-assembly, this assembly strategy is superior for manipulating multilevel architectures because the structures of the building blocks and higher-order hierarchies can be regulated separately in the first and higher-level assembly, respectively. However, despite the substantial advances in the self-assembly of copolymer micelles in recent years, universal laws have not been comprehensively summarized. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current progress and developing prospects of the self-assembly of copolymer micelles. In particular, the significant role of theoretical simulations in revealing the mechanism of copolymer micelle self-assembly is discussed.","610":"","611":"As the world moves toward electromobility and a concomitant decarbonization of its electrical supply, modern society is also entering a so-called fourth industrial revolution marked by a boom of electronic devices and digital technologies.

Starting from such a critical analysis and integrating robust structural data, this review aims at pointing out there is room to promote organic-based electrochemical energy storage. Combined with recycling solutions, redox-active organic species could decrease the pressure on inorganic compounds and offer valid options in terms of environmental footprint and possible disruptive chemistries to meet the energy storage needs of both today and tomorrow.

However, the abundance of (bio)molecules in these samples can significantly impede performance at the transducing interface where nonspecific adsorption (fouling) can both block specific signal (reducing sensitivity) and greatly reduce assay specificity. Herein, we aim to provide a comprehensive review discussing concepts and recent advances in the construction of antifouling sensors that are, through the use of chemical, physical, or biological engineering, capable of operating in complex sample matrix (e.g., serum). We specifically highlight a range of molecular approaches to the construction of solid sensory interfaces (planar and nanoparticulate) and their characterization and performance in diverse in vitro and in vivo analyte (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, cells, neuronal transmitters) detection applications via derived selective optical or electrochemical strategies.

Compared with other spectroscopic methods, it stands out by its sensitivity to the protonation state, H-bonding, and the conformation of different groups in proteins, including the peptide backbone, amino acid side chains, internal water molecules, or cofactors. In particular, the detection of protonation and H-bonding changes in a time-resolved manner, not easily obtained by other techniques, is one of the most successful applications of IR difference spectroscopy. The present review deals with the use of perturbations designed to specifically change the protein between two (or more) functionally relevant states, a strategy often referred to as reaction-induced IR difference spectroscopy. In the first half of this contribution, I review the technique of reaction-induced IR difference spectroscopy of proteins, with special emphasis given to the preparation of suitable samples and their characterization, strategies for the perturbation of proteins, and methodologies for time-resolved measurements (from nanoseconds to minutes). The second half of this contribution focuses on the spectral interpretation. It starts by reviewing how changes in H-bonding, medium polarity, and vibrational coupling affect vibrational frequencies, intensities, and bandwidths. It is followed by band assignments, a crucial aspect mostly performed with the help of isotopic labeling and site-directed mutagenesis, and complemented by integration and interpretation of the results in the context of the studied protein, an aspect increasingly supported by spectral calculations. Selected examples from the literature, predominately but not exclusively from retinal proteins, are used to illustrate the topics covered in this review.","617":"Immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) is a paradigm-shifting molecular imaging modality combining the superior targeting specificity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the inherent sensitivity of PET technique. A variety of radionuclides and mAbs have been exploited to develop immunoPET probes, which has been driven by the development and optimization of radiochemistry and conjugation strategies. In addition, tumor-targeting vectors with a short circulation time (e.g., Nanobody) or with an enhanced binding affinity (e.g., bispecific antibody) are being used to design novel immunoPET probes. Accordingly, several immunoPET probes, such as 89Zr-Df-pertuzumab and 89Zr-atezolizumab, have been successfully translated for clinical use. By noninvasively and dynamically revealing the expression of heterogeneous tumor antigens, immunoPET imaging is gradually changing the theranostic landscape of several types of malignancies. ImmunoPET is the method of choice for imaging specific tumor markers, immune cells, immune checkpoints, and inflammatory processes. Furthermore, the integration of immunoPET imaging in antibody drug development is of substantial significance because it provides pivotal information regarding antibody targeting abilities and distribution profiles.

While numerous comprehensions about the single-atom photocatalysts have recently been amassed, advanced characterization techniques and vital theoretical studies are strengthening our understanding on these fascinating materials, allowing us to forecast their working mechanisms and applications in photocatalysis. In this review, we begin by describing the general background and definition of the single-atom photocatalysts.

Thereafter, the current available characterization techniques for single-atom photocatalysts are summarized. After having some fundamental understanding on the single-atom photocatalysts, their advantages and applications in photocatalysis are discussed. Finally, we end this review with a look into the remaining challenges and future perspectives of single-atom photocatalysts. We anticipate that this review will provide some inspiration for the future discovery of the single-atom photocatalysts, manifestly stimulating the development in this emerging research area.","620":"Nitrogenase is the enzyme that catalyzes biological N2 reduction to NH3. This enzyme achieves an impressive rate enhancement over the uncatalyzed reaction. Given the high demand for N2 fixation to support food and chemical production and the heavy reliance of the industrial Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation reaction on fossil fuels, there is a strong need to elucidate how nitrogenase achieves this difficult reaction under benign conditions as a means of informing the design of next generation synthetic catalysts. This Review summarizes recent progress in addressing how nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of an array of substrates. New insights into the mechanism of N2 and proton reduction are first considered. This is followed by a summary of recent gains in understanding the reduction of a number of other nitrogenous compounds not considered to be physiological substrates. Progress in understanding the reduction of a wide range of C-based substrates, including CO and CO2, is also discussed, and remaining challenges in understanding nitrogenase substrate reduction are considered.","621":"From a glass of water to glaciers in Antarctica, water-air and ice-air interfaces are abundant on Earth. Molecular-level structure and dynamics at these interfaces are key for understanding many chemical\/physical\/atmospheric processes including the slipperiness of ice surfaces, the surface tension of water, and evaporation\/sublimation of water. Sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the molecular-level structure of these interfaces because SFG can specifically probe the topmost interfacial water molecules separately from the bulk and is sensitive to molecular conformation. Nevertheless, experimental SFG has several limitations. For example, SFG cannot provide information on the depth of the interface and how the orientation of the molecules varies with distance from the surface. By combining the SFG spectroscopy with simulation techniques, one can directly compare the experimental data with the simulated SFG spectra, allowing us to unveil the molecular-level structure of water-air and ice-air interfaces. Here, we present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for SFG spectra calculations. We systematically compare the SFG spectra computed with different approaches, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. Furthermore, we account for the findings through combined SFG experiments and simulations and provide future challenges for SFG experiments and simulations at different aqueous interfaces.","622":null,"623":"Biological nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase, which facilitates the cleavage of the relatively inert triple bond of N2. Nitrogenase is most commonly associated with the molybdenum-iron cofactor called FeMoco or the M-cluster, and it has been the subject of extensive structural and spectroscopic characterization over the past 60 years. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, two \"alternative nitrogenase\" systems were discovered, isolated, and found to incorporate V or Fe in place of Mo. These systems are regulated by separate gene clusters; however, there is a high degree of structural and functional similarity between each nitrogenase. Limited studies with the V- and Fe-nitrogenases initially demonstrated that these enzymes were analogously active as the Mo-nitrogenase, but more recent investigations have found capabilities that are unique to the alternative systems. In this review, we will discuss the reactivity, biosynthetic, and mechanistic proposals for the alternative nitrogenases as well as their electronic and structural properties in comparison to the well-characterized Mo-dependent system. Studies over the past 10 years have been particularly fruitful, though key aspects about V- and Fe-nitrogenases remain unexplored.","624":"The metallobiochemistry underlying the formation of the inorganic N-N-bond-containing molecules nitrous oxide (N2O), dinitrogen (N2), and hydrazine (N2H4) is essential to the lifestyles of diverse organisms. Similar reactions hold promise as means to use N-based fuels as alternative carbon-free energy sources. This review discusses research efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying biological N-N bond formation in primary metabolism and how the associated reactions are tied to energy transduction and organismal survival. These efforts comprise studies of both natural and engineered metalloenzymes as well as synthetic model complexes.","625":"To advance current Li rechargeable batteries further, tremendous emphasis has been made on the development of anode materials with higher capacities than the widely commercialized graphite. Some of these anode materials exhibit capacities above the theoretical value predicted based on conventional mechanisms of Li storage, namely insertion, alloying, and conversion. In addition, in contrast to conventional observations of loss upon cycling, the capacity has been found to increase during repeated cycling in a significant number of cases. As the internal environment in the battery is very complicated and continuously changing, these abnormal charge storage behaviors are caused by diverse reactions. In this review, we will introduce our current understanding of reported reactions accounting for the extra capacity. It includes formation\/decomposition of electrolyte-derived surface layer, the possibility of additional charge storage at sharp interfaces between electronic and ionic sinks, redox reactions of Li-containing species, unconventional activity of structural defects, and metallic-cluster like Li storage. We will also discuss how the changes in the anode can induce capacity increase upon cycling. With this knowledge, new insights into possible strategies to effectively and sustainably utilize these abnormal charge storage mechanisms to produce vertical leaps in performance of anode materials will be laid out.","626":"The fundamental roles that peptides and proteins play in today's biology makes it almost indisputable that peptides were key players in the origin of life. Insofar as it is appropriate to extrapolate back from extant biology to the prebiotic world, one must acknowledge the critical importance that interconnected molecular networks, likely with peptides as key components, would have played in life's origin. In this review, we summarize chemical processes involving peptides that could have contributed to early chemical evolution, with an emphasis on molecular interactions between peptides and other classes of organic molecules. We first summarize mechanisms by which amino acids and similar building blocks could have been produced and elaborated into proto-peptides. Next, non-covalent interactions of peptides with other peptides as well as with nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, metal ions, and aromatic molecules are discussed in relation to the possible roles of such interactions in chemical evolution of structure and function. Finally, we describe research involving structural alternatives to peptides and covalent adducts between amino acids\/peptides and other classes of molecules. We propose that ample future breakthroughs in origin-of-life chemistry will stem from investigations of interconnected chemical systems in which synergistic interactions between different classes of molecules emerge.","627":"Peptides and proteins are naturally chiral molecular systems so that sensing their structure and conformation with chirality-based spectral methods is an obvious and long-used diagnostic application. Extending chiroptical techniques to measurement of vibrational transitions, in the form of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and Raman optical activity (ROA), expands the number and types of excitations available that might provide structural insight and can provide an alternate and, in some cases, a more distinctive conformational probe. Since the dominant repeating structural element in peptides is the locally achiral amide group, VCD senses the polymeric structure through amide coupling, which is directly dependent on secondary structure. Determination of the type and relative contribution of these structural components through empirical correlation with spectral character has been the main application of VCD for peptides and proteins, although this is now reinforced by extensive theoretical modeling. Monitoring structural and conformational change induced by environmental perturbations provides another important application. More recently, VCD has been used to detect morphological variations in fibril states of aggregated peptides and proteins. ROA has parallel secondary structural sensitivities, with more applications for proteins than peptides, and has more sensitivity to local configuration and side chains. This review covers the range of peptide studies done with VCD and extends them to compare with example protein and ROA applications.","628":"Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) represent an important category of porous solids. PAFs possess rigid frameworks and exceptionally high surface areas, and, uniquely, they are constructed from carbon-carbon-bond-linked aromatic-based building units. Various functionalities can either originate from the intrinsic chemistry of their building units or are achieved by postmodification of the aromatic motifs using established reactions. Specially, the strong carbon-carbon bonding renders PAFs stable under harsh chemical treatments. Therefore, PAFs exhibit specificity in their chemistry and functionalities compared with conventional porous materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks. The unique features of PAFs render them being tolerant of severe environments and readily functionalized by harsh chemical treatments. The research field of PAFs has experienced rapid expansion over the past decade, and it is necessary to provide a comprehensive guide to the essential development of the field at this stage. Regarding research into PAFs, the synthesis, functionalization, and applications are the three most important topics. In this thematic review, the three topics are comprehensively explained and aptly exemplified to shed light on developments in the field. Current questions and a perspective outlook will be summarized.","629":"Nonaqueous lithium-air batteries have garnered considerable research interest over the past decade due to their extremely high theoretical energy densities and potentially low cost. Significant advances have been achieved both in the mechanistic understanding of the cell reactions and in the development of effective strategies to help realize a practical energy storage device. By drawing attention to reports published mainly within the past 8 years, this review provides an updated mechanistic picture of the lithium peroxide based cell reactions and highlights key remaining challenges, including those due to the parasitic processes occurring at the reaction product-electrolyte, product-cathode, electrolyte-cathode, and electrolyte-anode interfaces. We introduce the fundamental principles and critically evaluate the effectiveness of the different strategies that have been proposed to mitigate the various issues of this chemistry, which include the use of solid catalysts, redox mediators, solvating additives for oxygen reaction intermediates, gas separation membranes, etc. Recently established cell chemistries based on the superoxide, hydroxide, and oxide phases are also summarized and discussed.","630":"The past decades have witnessed an increasing interest in developing advanced polymerization techniques subjected to external fields. Various physical modulations, such as temperature, light, electricity, magnetic field, ultrasound, and microwave irradiation, are noninvasive means, having superb but distinct abilities to regulate polymerizations in terms of process intensification and spatial and temporal controls. Gas as an emerging regulator plays a distinctive role in controlling polymerization and resembles a physical regulator in some cases. This review provides a systematic overview of seven types of external-field-regulated polymerizations, ranging from chain-growth to step-growth polymerization. A detailed account of the relevant mechanism and kinetics is provided to better understand the role of each external field in polymerization. In addition, given the crucial role of modeling and simulation in mechanisms and kinetics investigation, an overview of model construction and typical numerical methods used in this field as well as highlights of the interaction between experiment and simulation toward kinetics in the existing systems are given. At the end, limitations and future perspectives for this field are critically discussed. This state-of-the-art research progress not only provides the fundamental principles underlying external-field-regulated polymerizations but also stimulates new development of advanced polymerization methods.","631":"Heterogeneous interfaces that are ubiquitous in optoelectronic devices play a key role in the device performance and have led to the prosperity of today's microelectronics. Interface engineering provides an effective and promising approach to enhancing the device performance of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and even developing new functions. In fact, researchers from different disciplines have devoted considerable attention to this concept, which has started to evolve from simple improvement of the device performance to sophisticated construction of novel functionalities, indicating great potential for further applications in broad areas ranging from integrated circuits and energy conversion to catalysis and chemical\/biological sensors. In this review article, we provide a timely and comprehensive overview of current efficient approaches developed for building various delicate functional interfaces in OFETs, including interfaces within the semiconductor layers, semiconductor\/electrode interfaces, semiconductor\/dielectric interfaces, and semiconductor\/environment interfaces. We also highlight the major contributions and new concepts of integrating molecular functionalities into electrical circuits, which have been neglected in most previous reviews. This review will provide a fundamental understanding of the interplay between the molecular structure, assembly, and emergent functions at the molecular level and consequently offer novel insights into designing a new generation of multifunctional integrated circuits and sensors toward practical applications.","632":"Gas-phase, double resonance IR spectroscopy has proven to be an excellent approach to obtain structural information on peptides ranging from single amino acids to large peptides and peptide clusters. In this review, we discuss the state-of-the-art of infrared action spectroscopy of peptides in the far-IR and THz regime. An introduction to the field of far-IR spectroscopy is given, thereby highlighting the opportunities that are provided for gas-phase research on neutral peptides. Current experimental methods, including spectroscopic schemes, have been reviewed. Structural information from the experimental far-IR spectra can be obtained with the help of suitable theoretical approaches such as dynamical DFT techniques and the recently developed Graph Theory. The aim of this review is to underline how the synergy between far-IR spectroscopy and theory can provide an unprecedented picture of the structure of neutral biomolecules in the gas phase. The far-IR signatures of the discussed studies are summarized in a far-IR map, in order to gain insight into the origin of the far-IR localized and delocalized motions present in peptides and where they can be found in the electromagnetic spectrum.","633":"Advanced electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) that can store electrical energy efficiently while being miniature\/flexible\/wearable\/load-bearing are much needed for various applications ranging from flexible\/wearable\/portable electronics to lightweight electric vehicles\/aerospace equipment. Carbon-based fibers hold great promise in the development of these advanced EESDs (e.g., supercapacitors and batteries) due to their being lightweight, high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, flexibility, and tunable electrochemical performance. This review summarizes the fabrication techniques of carbon-based fibers, especially carbon nanofibers, carbon-nanotube-based fibers, and graphene-based fibers, and various strategies for improving their mechanical, electrical, and electrochemical performance. The design, assembly, and potential applications of advanced EESDs from these carbon-based fibers are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of carbon-based fibers for advanced EESDs are discussed.","634":"Transition-metal catalyzed reactions that are able to construct complex aliphatic amines from simple, readily available feedstocks have become a cornerstone of modern synthetic organic chemistry. In light of the ever-increasing importance of aliphatic amines across the range of chemical sciences, this review aims to provide a concise overview of modern transition-metal catalyzed approaches to alkylamine synthesis and their functionalization. Selected examples of amine bond forming reactions include: (a) hydroamination and hydroaminoalkylation, (b) transition-metal catalyzed C(sp3)-H functionalization, and (c) transition-metal catalyzed visible-light-mediated light photoredox catalysis.","635":null,"636":"The utilization of fossil fuels has enabled an unprecedented era of prosperity and advancement of well-being for human society. However, the associated increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can negatively affect global temperatures and ocean acidity. Moreover, fossil fuels are a limited resource and their depletion will ultimately force one to seek alternative carbon sources to maintain a sustainable economy. Converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels, using renewable energy, is one of the promising approaches in this regard. Major advances in energy-efficient CO2 conversion can potentially alleviate CO2 emissions, reduce the dependence on nonrenewable resources, and minimize the environmental impacts from the portions of fossil fuels displaced. Methanol (CH3OH) is an important chemical feedstock and can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines and fuel cells, as well as a platform molecule for the production of chemicals and fuels. As one of the promising approaches, thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH via heterogeneous catalysis has attracted great attention in the past decades. Major progress has been made in the development of various catalysts including metals, metal oxides, and intermetallic compounds. In addition, efforts are also put forth to define catalyst structures in nanoscale by taking advantage of nanostructured materials, which enables the tuning of the catalyst composition and modulation of surface structures and potentially endows more promising catalytic performance in comparison to the bulk materials prepared by traditional methods. Despite these achievements, significant challenges still exist in developing robust catalysts with good catalytic performance and long-term stability. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in this area, especially focusing on structure-activity relationship, as well as the importance of combining catalytic measurements, in situ characterization, and theoretical studies in understanding reaction mechanisms and identifying key descriptors for designing improved catalysts.","637":"Additive manufacturing (also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing) is being extensively utilized in many areas of electrochemistry to produce electrodes and devices, as this technique allows for fast prototyping and is relatively low cost. Furthermore, there is a variety of 3D-printing technologies available, which include fused deposition modeling (FDM), inkjet printing, select laser melting (SLM), and stereolithography (SLA), making additive manufacturing a highly desirable technique for electrochemical purposes. In particular, over the last number of years, a significant amount of research into using 3D printing to create electrodes\/devices for electrochemical energy conversion and storage has emerged. Strides have been made in this area; however, there are still a number of challenges and drawbacks that need to be overcome in order to 3D print active and stable electrodes\/devices for electrochemical energy conversion and storage to rival that of the state-of-the-art. In this Review, we will give an overview of the reasoning behind using 3D printing for these electrochemical applications. We will then discuss how the electrochemical performance of the electrodes\/devices are affected by the various 3D-printing technologies and by manipulating the 3D-printed electrodes by post modification techniques. Finally, we will give our insights into the future perspectives of this exciting field based on our discussion through this Review.","638":"Nitrogen is ubiquitous in both natural and laboratory-grown diamond, but the number and nature of the nitrogen-containing defects can have a profound effect on the diamond material and its properties. An ever-growing fraction of the supply of diamond appearing on the world market is now lab-grown. Here, we survey recent progress in two complementary diamond synthesis methods-high pressure high temperature (HPHT) growth and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), how each is allowing ever more precise control of nitrogen incorporation in the resulting diamond, and how the diamond produced by either method can be further processed (e.g., by implantation or annealing) to achieve a particular outcome or property. The burgeoning availability of diamond samples grown under well-defined conditions has also enabled huge advances in the characterization and understanding of nitrogen-containing defects in diamond-alone and in association with vacancies, hydrogen, and transition metal atoms. Among these, the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) defect in diamond is attracting particular current interest in account of the many new and exciting opportunities it offers for, for example, quantum technologies, nanoscale magnetometry, and biosensing.","639":"Significant progress has been made in the past 10-15 years on the design, synthesis, and properties of multimetallic coordination complexes with heterometallic metal-metal bonds that are paramagnetic. Several general classes have been explored including heterobimetallic compounds, heterotrimetallic compounds of either linear or triangular geometry, discrete molecular compounds containing a linear array of more than three metal atoms, and coordination polymers with a heterometallic metal-metal bonded backbone. We focus in this Review on the synthetic methods employed to access these compounds, their structural features, magnetic properties, and electronic structure. Regarding the metal-metal bond distances, we make use of the formal shortness ratio (FSR) for comparison of bond distances between a broad range of metal atoms of different sizes. The magnetic properties of these compounds can be described using an extension of the Goodenough-Kanamori rules to cases where two magnetic ions interact via a third metal atom. In describing the electronic structure, we focus on the ability (or not) of electrons to be delocalized across heterometallic bonds, allowing for rationalizations and predictions of single-molecule conductance measurements in paramagnetic heterometallic molecular wires.","640":"Metal-organic frameworks represent the ultimate chemical platform on which to develop a new generation of designer magnets. In contrast to the inorganic solids that have dominated permanent magnet technology for decades, metal-organic frameworks offer numerous advantages, most notably the nearly infinite chemical space through which to synthesize predesigned and tunable structures with controllable properties. Moreover, the presence of a rigid, crystalline structure based on organic linkers enables the potential for permanent porosity and postsynthetic chemical modification of the inorganic and organic components. Despite these attributes, the realization of metal-organic magnets with high ordering temperatures represents a formidable challenge, owing largely to the typically weak magnetic exchange coupling mediated through organic linkers. Nevertheless, recent years have seen a number of exciting advances involving frameworks based on a wide range of metal ions and organic linkers. This review provides a survey of structurally characterized metal-organic frameworks that have been shown to exhibit magnetic order. Section 1 outlines the need for new magnets and the potential role of metal-organic frameworks toward that end, and it briefly introduces the classes of magnets and the experimental methods used to characterize them. Section 2 describes early milestones and key advances in metal-organic magnet research that laid the foundation for structurally characterized metal-organic framework magnets. Sections 3 and 4 then outline the literature of metal-organic framework magnets based on diamagnetic and radical organic linkers, respectively. Finally, Section 5 concludes with some potential strategies for increasing the ordering temperatures of metal-organic framework magnets while maintaining structural integrity and additional function.","641":"Optically active molecular materials, such as organic conjugated polymers and biological systems, are characterized by strong coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Typically, simulations must go beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to account for non-adiabatic coupling between excited states. Indeed, non-adiabatic dynamics is commonly associated with exciton dynamics and photophysics involving charge and energy transfer, as well as exciton dissociation and charge recombination. Understanding the photoinduced dynamics in such materials is vital to providing an accurate description of exciton formation, evolution, and decay. This interdisciplinary field has matured significantly over the past decades. Formulation of new theoretical frameworks, development of more efficient and accurate computational algorithms, and evolution of high-performance computer hardware has extended these simulations to very large molecular systems with hundreds of atoms, including numerous studies of organic semiconductors and biomolecules. In this Review, we will describe recent theoretical advances including treatment of electronic decoherence in surface-hopping methods, the role of solvent effects, trivial unavoided crossings, analysis of data based on transition densities, and efficient computational implementations of these numerical methods. We also emphasize newly developed semiclassical approaches, based on the Gaussian approximation, which retain phase and width information to account for significant decoherence and interference effects while maintaining the high efficiency of surface-hopping approaches. The above developments have been employed to successfully describe photophysics in a variety of molecular materials.","642":null,"643":"Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been attracting tremendous attention owing to their structure (chirality) dependent outstanding properties, which endow them with great potential in a wide range of applications. The preparation of chirality-pure SWCNTs is not only a great scientific challenge but also a crucial requirement for many high-end applications. As such, research activities in this area over the last two decades have been very extensive. In this review, we summarize recent achievements and accumulated knowledge thus far and discuss future developments and remaining challenges from three aspects: controlled growth, postsynthesis sorting, and characterization techniques. In the growth part, we focus on the mechanism of chirality-controlled growth and catalyst design. In the sorting part, we organize and analyze existing literature based on sorting targets rather than methods. Since chirality assignment and quantification is essential in the study of selective preparation, we also include in the last part a comprehensive description and discussion of characterization techniques for SWCNTs. It is our view that even though progress made in this area is impressive, more efforts are still needed to develop both methodologies for preparing ultrapure (e.g., &gt;99.99%) SWCNTs in large quantity and nondestructive fast characterization techniques with high spatial resolution for various nanotube samples.","644":"Using anions to induce molecular structure is a rapidly growing area of dynamic and switchable supramolecular chemistry. The emphasis of this review is on helical anion foldamers in solution, and many of the beautiful complexes described herein are accentuated by their crystal structures. Anion foldamers are defined as single- or multistrand complexes-often helical-that incorporate one or more anions. The review begins by discussing foldamer structure and nomenclature and follows with discourse on the anions which are employed. Recent advances in functional foldamers that bind a single anion are examined, including: induced chirality, stimuli-responsive dynamics, fluorescence changes, organocatalysis, anion transport, and halogen bonding. The review then inspects multianion foldamers, and this section is organized by the number of strands within the foldamer-from single- to triple-strand foldamers. Finally, the review is punctuated by recent hydrogen- and halogen-bonding triple-strand anion foldamers.","645":"Water is essential in all aspects of life, being the defining characteristic of our planet and even our body. Regrettably, water pollution is increasingly becoming a challenge due to novel anthropogenic pollutants. Of particular concern are emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), the term used not only to cover newly developed compounds but also compounds newly discovered as contaminants in the environment. Aside from anthropogenic contamination, higher temperature and more extreme and less predictable weather conditions are projected to affect water availability and distribution. Therefore, wastewater treatment has to become a valuable water resource and its reuse is an important issue that must be carried out efficiently. Among the novel technologies considered in water remediation processes, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are regarded as promising materials for the elimination of EOCs since they present many properties that commend them in water treatment: large surface area, easy functionalizable cavities, some are stable in water, and synthesized at large scale, etc. This review highlights the advances in the use of MOFs in the elimination (adsorption and\/or degradation) of EOCs from water, classifying them by the nature of the contaminant.","646":"Since its development in the 1970s, the rechargeable alkali-ion battery has proven to be a truly transformative technology, providing portable energy storage for devices ranging from small portable electronics to sizable electric vehicles. Here, we present a review of modern theoretical and computational approaches to the study and design of rechargeable alkali-ion battery materials. Starting from fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics phenomenological equations, we rigorously derive the theoretical relationships for key battery properties, such as voltage, capacity, alkali diffusivity, and other electrochemically relevant computable quantities. We then present an overview of computational techniques for the study of rechargeable alkali-ion battery materials, followed by a critical review of the literature applying these techniques to yield crucial insights into battery operation and performance. Finally, we provide perspectives on outstanding challenges and opportunities in the theory and computation of rechargeable alkali-ion battery materials.","647":"Over the past decades, Li-ion battery (LIB) has turned into one of the most important advances in the history of technology due to its extensive and in-depth impact on our life. Its omnipresence in all electric vehicles, consumer electronics and electric grids relies on the precisely tuned electrochemical dynamics and interactions among the electrolytes and the diversified anode and cathode chemistries therein. With consumers' demand for battery performance ever increasing, more and more stringent requirements are being imposed upon the established equilibria among these LIB components, and it became clear that the state-of-the-art electrolyte systems could no longer sustain the desired technological trajectory. Driven by such gap, researchers started to explore more unconventional electrolyte systems. From superconcentrated solvent-in-salt electrolytes to solid-state electrolytes, the current research realm of novel electrolyte systems has grown to unprecedented levels. In this review, we will avoid discussions on current state-of-the-art electrolytes but instead focus exclusively on unconventional electrolyte systems that represent new concepts.","648":"Self-assembled organic nanotubes made of single or multiple molecular components can be classified into soft-matter nanotubes (SMNTs) by contrast with hard-matter nanotubes, such as carbon and other inorganic nanotubes. To date, diverse self-assembly processes and elaborate template procedures using rationally designed organic molecules have produced suitable tubular architectures with definite dimensions, structural complexity, and hierarchy for expected functions and applications. Herein, we comprehensively discuss every functions and possible applications of a wide range of SMNTs as bulk materials or single components. This Review highlights valuable contributions mainly in the past decade. Fifteen different families of SMNTs are discussed from the viewpoints of chemical, physical, biological, and medical applications, as well as action fields (e.g., interior, wall, exterior, whole structure, and ensemble of nanotubes). Chemical applications of the SMNTs are associated with encapsulating materials and sensors. SMNTs also behave, while sometimes undergoing morphological transformation, as a catalyst, template, liquid crystal, hydro-\/organogel, superhydrophobic surface, and micron size engine. Physical functions pertain to ferro-\/piezoelectricity and energy migration\/storage, leading to the applications to electrodes or supercapacitors, and mechanical reinforcement. Biological functions involve artificial chaperone, transmembrane transport, nanochannels, and channel reactors. Finally, medical functions range over drug delivery, nonviral gene transfer vector, and virus trap.","649":"The ability of enzymes, including ribozymes, to catalyze side reactions is believed to be essential to the evolution of novel biochemical activities. It has been speculated that the earliest ribozymes, whose emergence marked the origin of life, were low in activity but high in promiscuity, and that these early ribozymes gave rise to specialized descendants with higher activity and specificity. Here, we review the concepts related to promiscuity and examine several cases of highly promiscuous ribozymes. We consider the evidence bearing on the question of whether de novo ribozymes would be quantitatively more promiscuous than later evolved ribozymes or protein enzymes. We suggest that while de novo ribozymes appear to be promiscuous in general, they are not obviously more promiscuous than more highly evolved or active sequences. Promiscuity is a trait whose value would depend on selective pressures, even during prebiotic evolution.","650":"Nitrogenase is the only enzyme capable of reducing N2 to NH3. This challenging reaction requires the coordinated transfer of multiple electrons from the reductase, Fe-protein, to the catalytic component, MoFe-protein, in an ATP-dependent fashion. In the last two decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding of how nitrogenase orchestrates electron transfer (ET) from the Fe-protein to the catalytic site of MoFe-protein and how energy from ATP hydrolysis transduces the ET processes. In this review, we summarize these advances, with focus on the structural and thermodynamic redox properties of nitrogenase component proteins and their complexes, as well as on new insights regarding the mechanism of ET reactions during catalysis and how they are coupled to ATP hydrolysis. We also discuss recently developed chemical, photochemical, and electrochemical methods for uncoupling substrate reduction from ATP hydrolysis, which may provide new avenues for studying the catalytic mechanism of nitrogenase.","651":null,"652":"Tremendous efforts are being made to develop electrode materials, electrolytes, and separators for energy storage devices to meet the needs of emerging technologies such as electric vehicles, decarbonized electricity, and electrochemical energy storage. However, the sustainability concerns of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and next-generation rechargeable batteries have received little attention. Recycling plays an important role in the overall sustainability of future batteries and is affected by battery attributes including environmental hazards and the value of their constituent resources. Therefore, recycling should be considered when developing battery systems. Herein, we provide a systematic overview of rechargeable battery sustainability. With a particular focus on electric vehicles, we analyze the market competitiveness of batteries in terms of economy, environment, and policy. Considering the large volumes of batteries soon to be retired, we comprehensively evaluate battery utilization and recycling from the perspectives of economic feasibility, environmental impact, technology, and safety. Battery sustainability is discussed with respect to life-cycle assessment and analyzed from the perspectives of strategic resources and economic demand. Finally, we propose a 4H strategy for battery recycling with the aims of high efficiency, high economic return, high environmental benefit, and high safety. New challenges and future prospects for battery sustainability are also highlighted.","653":"Nitrogenase harbors three distinct metal prosthetic groups that are required for its activity. The simplest one is a [4Fe-4S] cluster located at the Fe protein nitrogenase component. The MoFe protein component carries an [8Fe-7S] group called P-cluster and a [7Fe-9S-C-Mo-R-homocitrate] group called FeMo-co. Formation of nitrogenase metalloclusters requires the participation of the structural nitrogenase components and many accessory proteins, and occurs both in situ, for the P-cluster, and in external assembly sites for FeMo-co. The biosynthesis of FeMo-co is performed stepwise and involves molecular scaffolds, metallochaperones, radical chemistry, and novel and unique biosynthetic intermediates. This review provides a critical overview of discoveries on nitrogenase cofactor structure, function, and activity over the last four decades.","654":null,"655":"As a novel member of the two-dimensional nanomaterial family, mono- or few-layer black phosphorus (BP) with direct bandgap and high charge carrier mobility is promising in many applications such as microelectronic devices, photoelectronic devices, energy technologies, and catalysis agents. Due to its benign elemental composition (phosphorus), large surface area, electronic\/photonic performances, and chemical\/biological activities, BP has also demonstrated a great potential in biomedical applications including biosensing, photothermal\/photodynamic therapies, controlled drug releases, and antibacterial uses. The nature of the BP-bio interface is comprised of dynamic contacts between nanomaterials (NMs) and biological systems, where BP and the biological system interact. The physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface play a critical role in the biological effects of NMs. In this review, we discuss the interface in the context of BP as a nanomaterial and its unique physicochemical properties that may affect its biological effects. Herein, we comprehensively reviewed the recent studies on the interactions between BP and biomolecules, cells, and animals and summarized various cellular responses, inflammatory\/immunological effects, as well as other biological outcomes of BP depending on its own physical properties, exposure routes, and biodistribution. In addition, we also discussed the environmental behaviors and potential risks on environmental organisms of BP. Based on accumulating knowledge on the BP-bio interfaces, this review also summarizes various safer-by-design strategies to change the physicochemical properties including chemical stability and nano-bio interactions, which are critical in tuning the biological behaviors of BP. The better understanding of the biological activity of BP at BP-bio interfaces and corresponding methods to overcome the challenges would promote its future exploration in terms of bringing this new nanomaterial to practical applications.","656":"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline porous organic polymers with permanent porosity and highly ordered structures. Unlike other polymers, a significant feature of COFs is that they are structurally predesignable, synthetically controllable, and functionally manageable. In principle, the topological design diagram offers geometric guidance for the structural tiling of extended porous polygons, and the polycondensation reactions provide synthetic ways to construct the predesigned primary and high-order structures. Progress over the past decade in the chemistry of these two aspects undoubtedly established the base of the COF field. By virtue of the availability of organic units and the diversity of topologies and linkages, COFs have emerged as a new field of organic materials that offer a powerful molecular platform for complex structural design and tailor-made functional development. Here we target a comprehensive review of the COF field, provide a historic overview of the chemistry of the COF field, survey the advances in the topology design and synthetic reactions, illustrate the structural features and diversities, scrutinize the development and potential of various functions through elucidating structure-function correlations based on interactions with photons, electrons, holes, spins, ions, and molecules, discuss the key fundamental and challenging issues that need to be addressed, and predict the future directions from chemistry, physics, and materials perspectives.","657":"In this contribution, we provide a comprehensive overview of C-H activation methods promoted by NHC-transition metal complexes, covering the literature since 2002 (the year of the first report on metal-NHC-catalyzed C-H activation) through June 2019, focusing on both NHC ligands and C-H activation methods. This review covers C-H activation reactions catalyzed by group 8 to 11 NHC-metal complexes. Through discussing the role of NHC ligands in promoting challenging C-H activation methods, the reader is provided with an overview of this important area and its crucial role in forging carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds by directly engaging ubiquitous C-H bonds.","658":"","659":"Solution-processed solar cells are appealing because of the low manufacturing cost, the good compatibility with flexible substrates, and the ease of large-scale fabrication. Whereas solution-processable active materials have been widely adopted for the fabrication of organic, dye-sensitized, and perovskite solar cells, vacuum-deposited transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) such as indium tin oxide, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and aluminum-doped tin oxide are still the most frequently used transparent electrodes (TEs) for solar cells. These TCOs not only significantly increase the manufacturing cost of the device, but also are too brittle for future flexible and wearable applications. Therefore, developing solution-processed TEs for solar cells is of great interest. This paper provides a detailed discussion on the recent development of solution-processed TEs, including the chemical synthesis of the electrode materials, the solution-based technologies for the electrode fabrication, the optical and electrical properties of the solution-processed TEs, and their applications on solar cells.","660":"Uncovering the mechanisms of virus infection and assembly is crucial for preventing the spread of viruses and treating viral disease. The technique of single-virus tracking (SVT), also known as single-virus tracing, allows one to follow individual viruses at different parts of their life cycle and thereby provides dynamic insights into fundamental processes of viruses occurring in live cells. SVT is typically based on fluorescence imaging and reveals insights into previously unreported infection mechanisms. In this review article, we provide the readers a broad overview of the SVT technique. We first summarize recent advances in SVT, from the choice of fluorescent labels and labeling strategies to imaging implementation and analytical methodologies. We then describe representative applications in detail to elucidate how SVT serves as a valuable tool in virological research. Finally, we present our perspectives regarding the future possibilities and challenges of SVT.","661":"","662":"Proteins at interfaces play important roles in cell biology, immunology, bioengineering, and biomimetic material design. Many biological processes are based on interfacial protein action, ranging from cellular communication to immune responses and the protein-driven mineralization of bone. Despite the importance of interfacial proteins, comparatively little is known about their structure. The standard methods for studying crystalline or solution-phase proteins (X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy) are not well-suited for studying proteins at interfaces, and for these proteins we still lack a corresponding technique that can provide the same level of structural resolution. This is not surprising in view of the challenges involved in probing the structure of proteins within monomolecular films assembled at a very thin interface in situ. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy has the potential to overcome this challenge and investigate the structure and dynamics of proteins at interfaces at the molecular level with subpicosecond time resolution. While SFG studies were initially limited to simple model peptides, the past decade has seen a dramatic advancement of experimental techniques and data analysis methods that has made it possible to also study interfacial proteins and their folding, binding, orientation, hydration, and dynamics. In this review, we first explain the principles of SFG spectroscopy and the experimental and theoretical methods to measure and analyze protein SFG spectra. Then we give an extensive overview of the interfacial proteins studied to date with SFG. We highlight representative examples to demonstrate recent advances in probing the structure of proteins at the interfaces of liquids, membranes, minerals, and synthetic materials.","663":"Li-ion batteries (LIBs), commercialized in 1991, have the highest energy density among practical secondary batteries and are widely utilized in electronics, electric vehicles, and even stationary energy storage systems. Along with the expansion of their demand and application, concern about the resources of Li and Co is growing. Therefore, secondary batteries composed of earth-abundant elements are desired to complement LIBs. In recent years, K-ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted significant attention as potential alternatives to LIBs. Previous studies have developed positive and negative electrode materials for KIBs and demonstrated several unique advantages of KIBs over LIBs and Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Thus, besides being free from any scarce\/toxic elements, the low standard electrode potentials of K\/K+ electrodes lead to high operation voltages competitive to those observed in LIBs. Moreover, K+ ions exhibit faster ionic diffusion in electrolytes due to weaker interaction with solvents and anions than that of Li+ ions; this is essential to realize high-power KIBs. This review comprehensively covers the studies on electrochemical materials for KIBs, including electrode and electrolyte materials and a discussion on recent achievements and remaining\/emerging issues. The review also includes insights into electrode reactions and solid-state ionics and nonaqueous solution chemistry as well as perspectives on the research-based development of KIBs compared to those of LIBs and NIBs.","664":"Anions play a vital role in a broad range of environmental, technological, and physiological processes, making their detection\/quantification valuable. Electroanalytical sensors offer much to the selective, sensitive, cheap, portable, and real-time analysis of anion presence where suitable combinations of selective (noncovalent) recognition and transduction can be integrated. Spurred on by significant developments in anion supramolecular chemistry, electrochemical anion sensing has received considerable attention in the past two decades. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of all electroanalytical techniques that have been used for this purpose, including voltammetric, impedimetric, capacititive, and potentiometric methods. We will confine our discussion to sensors that are based on synthetic anion receptors with a specific focus on reversible, noncovalent interactions, in particular, hydrogen- and halogen-bonding. Apart from their sensory properties, we will also discuss how electrochemical techniques can be used to study anion recognition processes (e.g., binding constant determination) and will furthermore provide a detailed outlook over future efforts and promising new avenues in this field.","665":"The chemistry of abiotic nucleotide synthesis of RNA and DNA in the context of their prebiotic origins on early earth is a continuing challenge. How did (or how can) the nucleotides form and assemble from the small molecule inventories and under conditions that prevailed on early earth 3.5-4 billion years ago? This review provides a background and up-to-date progress that will allow the reader to judge where the field stands currently and what remains to be achieved. We start with a brief primer on the biological synthesis of nucleotides, followed by an extensive focus on the prebiotic formation of the components of nucleotides-either via the synthesis of ribose and the canonical nucleobases and then joining them together or by building both the conjoined sugar and nucleobase, part-by-part-toward the ultimate goal of forming RNA and DNA by polymerization. The review will emphasize that there are-and will continue to be-many more questions than answers from the synthetic, mechanistic, and analytical perspectives. We wrap up the review with a cautionary note in this context about coming to conclusions as to whether the problem of chemistry of prebiotic nucleotide synthesis has been solved.","666":"","667":"This review describes the additions of allylmagnesium reagents to carbonyl compounds and to imines, focusing on the differences in reactivity between allylmagnesium halides and other Grignard reagents. In many cases, allylmagnesium reagents either react with low stereoselectivity when other Grignard reagents react with high selectivity, or allylmagnesium reagents react with the opposite stereoselectivity. This review collects hundreds of examples, discusses the origins of stereoselectivities or the lack of stereoselectivity, and evaluates why selectivity may not occur and when it will likely occur.","668":"During the past decades, synthetic organic chemistry discovered that directing group assisted C-H activation is a key tool for the expedient and siteselective construction of C-C bonds. Among the various directing group strategies, bidentate directing groups are now recognized as one of the most efficient devices for the selective functionalization of certain positions due to fact that its metal center permits fine, tunable, and reversible coordination. The family of bidentate directing groups permit various types of assistance to be achieved, such as N,N-dentate, N,O-dentate, and N,S-dentate auxiliaries, which are categorized based on the coordination site. In this review, we broadly discuss various C-H bond functionalization reactions for the formation of C-C bonds with the aid of bidentate directing groups.","669":"Since the positive influences of defects on the performance of electroceramics were discovered, investigations concerning on defects and aliovalent doping routes have grown rapidly in the fields of inorganic chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this article, we summarized the types of defects in electroceramics as well as characterization tools of defects and highlighted the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic defects on the material performances with the emphasis on dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties. We mainly introduced defect related theoretical simulation and experimental results in several typical incipient ferroelectrics, ferroelectrics, and antiferroelectrics. Hence, the influences of defects on the crystal lattice were summed up, and then the main physical mechanisms were highlighted. Particularly, the performance enhancements of aliovalently doped electroceramics were also evaluated and reviewed. Finally, the outlook and challenges were discussed on the basis of their current developments. This article covers not only an overview of the state-of-the-art advances of defects and aliovalent doping routes in electroceramics but also the future prospects that may open another window to tune the electrical performance of electroceramics via intentionally introducing certain defects.","670":"This review provides a synthetic overview of the recent research advancements addressing the topic of catalysis with colloidal ruthenium metal nanoparticles through the last five years. The aim is to enlighten the interest of ruthenium metal at the nanoscale for a selection of catalytic reactions performed in solution condition. The recent progress in nanochemistry allowed providing well-controlled ruthenium nanoparticles which served as models and allowed study of how their characteristics influence their catalytic properties. Although this parameter is not enough often taken into consideration the surface chemistry of ruthenium nanoparticles starts to be better understood. This offers thus a strong basis to better apprehend catalytic processes on the metal surface and also explore how these can be affected by the stabilizing molecules as well as the ruthenium crystallographic structure. Ruthenium nanoparticles have been reported for their application as catalysts in solution for diverse reactions. The main ones are reduction, oxidation, Fischer-Tropsch, C-H activation, CO2 transformation, and hydrogen production through amine borane dehydrogenation or water-splitting reactions, which will be reviewed here. Results obtained showed that ruthenium nanoparticles can be highly performant in these reactions, but efforts are still required in order to be able to rationalize the results. Beside their catalytic performance, ruthenium nanocatalysts are very good models in order to investigate key parameters for a better controlled nanocatalysis. This is a challenging but fundamental task in order to develop more efficient catalytic systems, namely more active and more selective catalysts able to work in mild conditions.","671":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are inherently crystalline, brittle porous solids. Conversely, polymers are flexible, malleable, and processable solids that are used for a broad range of commonly used technologies. The stark differences between the nature of MOFs and polymers has motivated efforts to hybridize crystalline MOFs and flexible polymers to produce composites that retain the desired properties of these disparate materials. Importantly, studies have shown that MOFs can be used to influence polymer structure, and polymers can be used to modulate MOF growth and characteristics. In this Review, we highlight the development and recent advances in the synthesis of MOF-polymer mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) and applications of these MMMs in gas and liquid separations and purifications, including aqueous applications such as dye removal, toxic heavy metal sequestration, and desalination. Other elegant ways of synthesizing MOF-polymer hybrid materials, such as grafting polymers to and from MOFs, polymerization of polymers within MOFs, using polymers to template MOFs, and the bottom-up synthesis of polyMOFs and polyMOPs are also discussed. This review highlights recent papers in the advancement of MOF-polymer hybrid materials, as well as seminal reports that significantly advanced the field.","672":"The dawn of the 21st century has brought with it a surge of research related to computer-guided approaches to catalyst design. In the past two decades, chemoinformatics, the application of informatics to solve problems in chemistry, has increasingly influenced prediction of activity and mechanistic investigations of organic reactions. The advent of advanced statistical and machine learning methods, as well as dramatic increases in computational speed and memory, has contributed to this emerging field of study. This review summarizes strategies to employ quantitative structure-selectivity relationships (QSSR) in asymmetric catalytic reactions. The coverage is structured by initially introducing the basic features of these methods. Subsequent topics are discussed according to increasing complexity of molecular representations. As the most applied subfield of QSSR in enantioselective catalysis, the application of local parametrization approaches and linear free energy relationships (LFERs) along with multivariate modeling techniques is described first. This section is followed by a description of global parametrization methods, the first of which is continuous chirality measures (CCM) because it is a single parameter derived from the global structure of a molecule. Chirality codes, global, multivariate descriptors, are then introduced followed by molecular interaction fields (MIFs), a global descriptor class that typically has the highest dimensionality. To highlight the current reach of QSSR in enantioselective transformations, a comprehensive collection of examples is presented. When combined with traditional experimental approaches, chemoinformatics holds great promise to predict new catalyst structures, rationalize mechanistic behavior, and profoundly change the way chemists discover and optimize reactions.","673":"Silicon electrochemistry has the potential to advance sustainable energy solutions by offering environmentally friendly and secure technologies that can contribute to the low-carbon economy. Electrochemical methods use electrons directly as reducing agents, eliminating the need for harmful chemicals and offering simpler, one-step, process control. Silicon itself is the second most abundant element in the earth's crust, is nontoxic, and is a robust material offering high efficiencies in solar photovoltaics. As such, silicon currently dominates the solar energy market and could continue to do so for the next few decades. This review summarizes recent achievements in the molten salt electrochemistry of silicon, highlighting subjects of technological significance such as the production of silicon by silica electro-deoxidation, the formation of photoactive layers, silicon electrorefining, and the synthesis of semiconductors as well as nanostructures for energy storage applications. The review highlights future opportunities and challenges such as the production of highly pure silicon, the creation of carbon-free anodes for oxygen production, and silicon electrodeposition from gaseous precursors.","674":null,"675":"The prospect of self-propelled artificial machines small enough to navigate within biological matter has fascinated and inspired researchers and the public alike since the dawn of nanotechnology. Despite many obstacles toward the realization of such devices, impressive progress on the development of its basic building block, the nanomotor, has been made over the past decade. Here, we review this emerging area with a focus on inorganic nanomotors driven or activated by light. We outline the distinct challenges and opportunities that differentiate nanomotors from micromotors based on a discussion of how stochastic forces influence the active motion of small particles. We introduce the relevant light-matter interactions and discuss how these can be utilized to classify nanomotors into three broad classes: nanomotors driven by optical momentum transfer, photothermal heating, and photocatalysis, respectively. On the basis of this classification, we then summarize and discuss the diverse body of nanomotor literature. We finally give a brief outlook on future challenges and possibilities in this rapidly evolving research area.","676":"Precise control over molecular movement is of fundamental and practical importance in physics, biology, and chemistry. At nanoscale, the peculiar functioning principles and the synthesis of individual molecular actuators and machines has been the subject of intense investigations and debates over the past 60 years. In this review, we focus on the design of collective motions that are achieved by integrating, in space and time, several or many of these individual mechanical units together. In particular, we provide an in-depth look at the intermolecular couplings used to physically connect a number of artificial mechanically active molecular units such as photochromic molecular switches, nanomachines based on mechanical bonds, molecular rotors, and light-powered rotary motors. We highlight the various functioning principles that can lead to their collective motion at various length scales. We also emphasize how their synchronized, or desynchronized, mechanical behavior can lead to emerging functional properties and to their implementation into new active devices and materials.","677":"The use of well-defined materials in heterogeneous catalysis will open up numerous new opportunities for the development of advanced catalysts to address the global challenges in energy and the environment. This review surveys the roles of nanoparticles and isolated single atom sites in catalytic reactions. In the second section, the effects of size, shape, and metal-support interactions are discussed for nanostructured catalysts. Case studies are summarized to illustrate the dynamics of structure evolution of well-defined nanoparticles under certain reaction conditions. In the third section, we review the syntheses and catalytic applications of isolated single atomic sites anchored on different types of supports. In the final part, we conclude by highlighting the challenges and opportunities of well-defined materials for catalyst development and gaining a fundamental understanding of their active sites.","678":"The development of new ion-activation\/dissociation methods continues to be one of the most active areas of mass spectrometry owing to the broad applications of tandem mass spectrometry in the identification and structural characterization of molecules. This Review will showcase the impact of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) as a frontier strategy for generating informative fragmentation patterns of ions, especially for biological molecules whose complicated structures, subtle modifications, and large sizes often impede molecular characterization. UVPD energizes ions via absorption of high-energy photons, which allows access to new dissociation pathways relative to more conventional ion-activation methods. Applications of UVPD for the analysis of peptides, proteins, lipids, and other classes of biologically relevant molecules are emphasized in this Review.","679":"Molecular motors are at the heart of cellular machinery, and they are involved in converting chemical and light energy inputs into efficient mechanical work. From a synthetic perspective, the most advanced molecular motors are rotators that are activated by light wherein a molecular subcomponent rotates unidirectionally around an axis. The mechanical work produced by arrays of molecular motors can be used to induce a macroscopic effect. Light activation offers advantages over biological chemically activated molecular motors because one can direct precise spatiotemporal inputs while conducting reactions in the gas phase, in solution and in vacuum, while generating no chemical byproducts or waste. In this review, we describe the origins of the first light-activated rotary motors and their modes of function, the structural modifications that led to newer motor designs with optimized rotary properties at variable activation wavelengths. Presented are molecular motor attachments to surfaces, their insertion into supramolecular structures and photomodulating materials, their use in catalysis, and their action in biological environments to produce exciting new prospects for biomedicine.","680":"Assembly-line polyketide synthases (PKSs) are among the most complex protein machineries known in nature, responsible for the biosynthesis of numerous compounds used in the clinic. Their present-day diversity is the result of an evolutionary path that has involved the emergence of a multimodular architecture and further diversification of assembly-line PKSs. In this review, we provide an overview of previous studies that investigated PKS evolution and propose a model that challenges the currently prevailing view that gene duplication has played a major role in the emergence of multimodularity. We also analyze the ensemble of orphan PKS clusters sequenced so far to evaluate how large the entire diversity of assembly-line PKS clusters and their chemical products could be. Finally, we examine the existing techniques to access the natural PKS diversity in natural and heterologous hosts and describe approaches to further expand this diversity through engineering.","681":null,"682":"This Review explores the class of plant-derived macrocyclic peptides called cyclotides. We include an account of their discovery, characterization, and distribution in the plant kingdom as well as a detailed analysis of their sequences and structures, biosynthesis and chemical synthesis, biological functions, and applications. These macrocyclic peptides are around 30 amino acids in size and are characterized by their head-to-tail cyclic backbone and cystine knot motif, which render them to be exceptionally stable, with resistance to thermal or enzymatic degradation. Routes to their chemical synthesis have been developed over the past two decades, and this capability has facilitated a wide range of mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies. In turn, these studies have both led to an increased understanding of their mechanisms of action as well as facilitated a range of applications in agriculture and medicine, as ecofriendly crop protection agents, and as drug leads or scaffolds for pharmaceutical design. Our overall objective in this Review is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of cyclotides that we hope will stimulate further work on this fascinating family of peptides.","683":"Since the discovery of catalysis by Au nanoparticles (NPs), unique catalytic features of Au have appeared that are greatly different from those of Pd and Pt. In this Review, we aimed to disclose how the unique catalytic abilities of Au are generated with respect to (a) the contact structures between Au and its supports and (b) the size of the Au particles. For CO oxidation, the catalytic activity of Au on reducible metal oxides (MOx) is strongly correlated with the amount of oxygen vacancies of the MOx surface, which play a key role in O2 activation. Single atoms, bilayers of Au, sub-nm clusters, clusters (1-2 nm), and NPs (2-5 nm) have been proposed as the active sizes of the Au species, which may depend on the type of support. For propylene epoxidation, the presence of isolated TiO4 units in SiO2 supports is important for the production of propylene oxide (PO). Au NPs facilitate the formation of Ti-OOH species, which leads to PO in the presence of H2 and O2, whereas Au clusters facilitate propylene hydrogenation. However, Au clusters can produce PO by using only O2 and water, whereas Au NPs cannot. For alcohol oxidation, the reducibility of the MOx supports greatly influences the catalytic activity of Au, and single Au atoms more effectively activate the lattice oxygen of CeO2. The basic and acidic sites of the MOx surface also play an important role in the deprotonation of alcohols and the activation of aldehydes, respectively. For selective hydrogenation, heterolytic dissociation of H2 takes place at the interface between Au and MOx, and the basic sites of MOx contribute to H2 activation. Recent research into the reaction mechanisms and the development of well-designed Au catalysts has provided new insights into the preparation of high-performance Au catalysts.","684":"The mechanistic understanding of protein functions requires insight into the structural and reaction dynamics. To elucidate these processes, a variety of experimental approaches are employed. Among them, time-resolved (TR) resonance Raman (RR) is a particularly versatile tool to probe processes of proteins harboring cofactors with electronic transitions in the visible range, such as retinal or heme proteins. TR RR spectroscopy offers the advantage of simultaneously providing molecular structure and kinetic information. The various TR RR spectroscopic methods can cover a wide dynamic range down to the femtosecond time regime and have been employed in monitoring photoinduced reaction cascades, ligand binding and dissociation, electron transfer, enzymatic reactions, and protein un- and refolding. In this account, we review the achievements of TR RR spectroscopy of nearly 50 years of research in this field, which also illustrates how the role of TR RR spectroscopy in molecular life science has changed from the beginning until now. We outline the various methodological approaches and developments and point out current limitations and potential perspectives.","685":"Infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy allows for the derivation of the vibrational fingerprint of molecular ions under tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) conditions. It provides insight into the nature and localization of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) affecting single amino acids and peptides. IRMPD spectroscopy, which takes advantage of the high sensitivity and resolution of MS\/MS, relies on a wavelength specific fragmentation process occurring on resonance with an IR active vibrational mode of the sampled species and is well suited to reveal the presence of a PTM and its impact in the molecular environment. IRMPD spectroscopy is clearly not a proteomics tool. It is rather a valuable source of information for fixed wavelength IRMPD exploited in dissociation protocols of peptides and proteins. Indeed, from the large variety of model PTM containing amino acids and peptides which have been characterized by IRMPD spectroscopy, specific signatures of PTMs such as phosphorylation or sulfonation can be derived. High throughput workflows relying on the selective fragmentation of modified peptides within a complex mixture have thus been proposed. Sequential fragmentations can be observed upon IR activation, which do not only give rise to rich fragmentation patterns but also overcome low mass cutoff limitations in ion trap mass analyzers. Laser-based vibrational spectroscopy of mass-selected ions holding various PTMs is an increasingly expanding field both in the variety of chemical issues coped with and in the technological advancements and implementations.","686":"Vaccines have had a profound impact on the management and prevention of infectious disease. In addition, the development of vaccines against chronic diseases has attracted considerable interest as an approach to prevent, rather than treat, conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and others. Subunit vaccines consist of nongenetic components of the infectious agent or disease-related epitope. In this Review, we discuss peptide-based vaccines and their potential in three therapeutic areas: infectious disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. We discuss factors that contribute to vaccine efficacy and how these parameters may potentially be modulated by design. We examine both clinically tested vaccines as well as nascent approaches and explore current challenges and potential remedies. While peptide vaccines hold substantial promise in the prevention of human disease, many obstacles remain that have hampered their clinical use; thus, continued research efforts to address these challenges are warranted.","687":null,"688":"Autocatalytic models for the emergence of homochirality have been of interest for more than half a century. The sole experimental example of such an amplifying autocatalytic reaction is the Soai reaction. In this review, we trace the history of the theoretical models and the experimental work that led up to the discovery of the remarkable, singular Soai reaction. The experimental and computational studies that have helped to delineate the mechanism of this reaction are discussed in detail. Studies of both the concept of chiral symmetry breaking as well as the subsequent chiral amplification process are discussed. Particular attention is paid to flaws in some of the published models, and suggestions are offered for how such issues might be avoided in future work. The outlook in the search for a prebiotically plausible version of such an amplifying autocatalytic system is presented.","689":"Plasmonic nanostructures possessing unique and versatile optoelectronic properties have been vastly investigated over the past decade. However, the full potential of plasmonic nanostructure has not yet been fully exploited, particularly with single-component homogeneous structures with monotonic properties, and the addition of new components for making multicomponent nanoparticles may lead to new-yet-unexpected or improved properties. Here we define the term \"multi-component nanoparticles\" as hybrid structures composed of two or more condensed nanoscale domains with distinctive material compositions, shapes, or sizes. We reviewed and discussed the designing principles and synthetic strategies to efficiently combine multiple components to form hybrid nanoparticles with a new or improved plasmonic functionality. In particular, it has been quite challenging to precisely synthesize widely diverse multicomponent plasmonic structures, limiting realization of the full potential of plasmonic heterostructures. To address this challenge, several synthetic approaches have been reported to form a variety of different multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, mainly based on heterogeneous nucleation, atomic replacements, adsorption on supports, and biomolecule-mediated assemblies. In addition, the unique and synergistic features of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, such as combination of pristine material properties, finely tuned plasmon resonance and coupling, enhanced light-matter interactions, geometry-induced polarization, and plasmon-induced energy and charge transfer across the heterointerface, were reported. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest advances on state-of-art synthetic strategies, unique properties, and promising applications of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles. These plasmonic nanoparticles including heterostructured nanoparticles and composite nanostructures are prepared by direct synthesis and physical force- or biomolecule-mediated assembly, which hold tremendous potential for plasmon-mediated energy transfer, magnetic plasmonics, metamolecules, and nanobiotechnology.","690":"The electrochemical properties and performances of lithium-ion batteries are primarily governed by their constituent electrode materials, whose intrinsic thermodynamic and kinetic properties are understood as the determining factor. As a part of complementing the intrinsic material properties, the strategy of nanosizing has been widely applied to electrodes to improve battery performance. It has been revealed that this not only improves the kinetics of the electrode materials but is also capable of regulating their thermodynamic properties, taking advantage of nanoscale phenomena regarding the changes in redox potential, solid-state solubility of the intercalation compounds, and reaction paths. In addition, the nanosizing of materials has recently enabled the discovery of new energy storage mechanisms, through which unexplored classes of electrodes could be introduced. Herein, we review the nanoscale phenomena discovered or exploited in lithium-ion battery chemistry thus far and discuss their potential implications, providing opportunities to further unveil uncharted electrode materials and chemistries. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the nanoscale phenomena presently employed in battery applications and suggest strategies to overcome these limitations.","691":"The extraordinary properties of biological materials often result from their sophisticated hierarchical structures. Through multilevel and cross-scale structural designs, biological materials offset the weakness of their individual building blocks and enhance performance at multiple length scales to match the multifunctional needs of organisms. One essential merit of hierarchical structure is that it can optimize the interfacial features of the \"building blocks\" at different length scales, from the molecular level to the macroscale. Understanding the roles of biological material interfaces (BMIs) on the determination of properties and functions of biological materials has become a growing interdisciplinary research area in recent years. A pivotal aim of these studies is to use BMIs as inspiration for developing bioinspired and biomimetic materials and devices with advanced structures and functions. Given these considerations, this review aims to comprehensively discuss the structure-property-function relationships of BMIs in nature. We particularly focus on the discussion of BMIs and their inspired materials from mechanical and optical perspectives because these two directions are the most well-investigated and closely related. The challenges and directions of design and fabrication of BMI-inspired mechanical and optical materials are also discussed. This review is expected to garner interest from advanced material communities as well as environmental, nanotechnology, food processing, and engineering fields.","692":"Protein semisynthesis-defined herein as the assembly of a protein from a combination of synthetic and recombinant fragments-is a burgeoning field of chemical biology that has impacted many areas in the life sciences. In this review, we provide a comprehensive survey of this area. We begin by discussing the various chemical and enzymatic methods now available for the manufacture of custom proteins containing noncoded elements. This section begins with a discussion of methods that are more chemical in origin and ends with those that employ biocatalysts. We also illustrate the commonalities that exist between these seemingly disparate methods and show how this is allowing for the development of integrated chemoenzymatic methods. This methodology discussion provides the technical foundation for the second part of the review where we cover the great many biological problems that have now been addressed using these tools. Finally, we end the piece with a short discussion on the frontiers of the field and the opportunities available for the future.","693":"Solid-state batteries have been attracting wide attention for next generation energy storage devices due to the probability to realize higher energy density and superior safety performance compared with the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries. However, there are still intimidating challenges for developing low cost and industrially scalable solid-state batteries with high energy density and stable cycling life for large-scale energy storage and electric vehicle applications. This review presents an overview on the scientific challenges, fundamental mechanisms, and design strategies for solid-state batteries, specifically focusing on the stability issues of solid-state electrolytes and the associated interfaces with both cathode and anode electrodes. First, we give a brief overview on the history of solid-state battery technologies, followed by introduction and discussion on different types of solid-state electrolytes. Then, the associated stability issues, from phenomena to fundamental understandings, are intensively discussed, including chemical, electrochemical, mechanical, and thermal stability issues; effective optimization strategies are also summarized. State-of-the-art characterization techniques and in situ and operando measurement methods deployed and developed to study the aforementioned issues are summarized as well. Following the obtained insights, perspectives are given in the end on how to design practically accessible solid-state batteries in the future.","694":"Transition metal-mediated formation of C-N bonds is an essential synthetic methodology. The discovery of the Chan-Lam amination provided a C-N bond forming process that was mild, convenient, and inexpensive, offering an alternative to complementary methods using other transition metals (TMs). Over the past 20 years, this reaction has seen considerable development in its scope of application, uptake into industry, and understanding of its mechanism. This review provides an account of the development of the Chan-Lam amination, highlighting progress and notable examples of application since 2011. Focus is given to evolution in mechanistic understanding and selected applications of the methodology within medicinal and process chemistry.","695":"Traceless solid-phase synthesis represents an ultimate sophisticated synthetic strategy on insoluble supports. Compounds synthesized on solid supports can be released without a trace of the linker that was used to tether the intermediates during the synthesis. Thus, the target products are composed only of the components (atoms, functional groups) inherent to the target core structure. A wide variety of synthetic strategies have been developed to prepare products in a traceless manner, and this review is dedicated to all aspects of traceless solid-phase organic synthesis. Importantly, the synthesis does not need to be carried out on a linker designed for traceless synthesis; most of the synthetic approaches described herein were developed using standard, commercially available linkers (originally devised for solid-phase peptide synthesis). The type of structure prepared in a traceless fashion is not restricted. The individual synthetic approaches are divided into eight sections, each devoted to a different methodology for traceless synthesis. Each section consists of a brief outline of the synthetic strategy followed by a description of individual reported syntheses.","696":"The search for evidence of extraterrestrial life in our Solar System is currently guided by our understanding of terrestrial biology and its associated biosignatures. The observed homochirality in all life on Earth, that is, the predominance of \"left-handed\" or l-amino acids and \"right-handed\" or d-sugars, is a unique property of life that is crucial for molecular recognition, enzymatic function, information storage and structure and is thought to be a prerequisite for the origin or early evolution of life. Therefore, the detection of l- or d-enantiomeric excesses (ee) of chiral amino acids and sugars could be a powerful indicator for extant or extinct life on another world. However, studies of primitive meteorites have revealed they contain extraterrestrial amino acids and sugar acids (aldonic acids) with large enantiomeric excesses of the same chirality as terrestrial biology resulting from nonbiological processes, complicating the use of chiral asymmetry by itself as a definitive biosignature. Here we review our current knowledge of the distributions and enantiomeric and isotopic compositions of amino acids and polyols found in meteorites compared to terrestrial biology and propose a set of criteria for future life detection missions that can be used to help establish the origin of chiral asymmetry.","697":"Asymmetric organocatalytic oxidations have been witnessed to an impressive development in the last years thanks to the establishment of important chiral hypervalent iodines(III\/V). Many different approaches involving both stoichiometric and catalytic versions have provided a fundamental advance in this area within asymmetric synthesis. The easily handing, nontoxic, mild, environmentally friendly (green oxidants), and high stability that are features of these reagents have been applied to many reactions and also have allowed exploring further unprecedented enantioselective transformations. The intention of the present review is thus to highlight as a whole the many approaches utilized up to date to prepare chiral iodines(III\/V), as well as their reactivity in a comprehensive manner.","698":"Inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) consist of linear chains of orthophosphate residues, linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. They are evolutionarily old biopolymers that are present from bacteria to man. No other molecule concentrates as much (bio)chemically usable energy as polyP. However, the function and metabolism of this long-neglected polymer are scarcely known, especially in higher eukaryotes. In recent years, interest in polyP experienced a renaissance, beginning with the discovery of polyP as phosphate source in bone mineralization. Later, two discoveries placed polyP into the focus of regenerative medicine applications. First, polyP shows morphogenetic activity, i.e., induces cell differentiation via gene induction, and, second, acts as an energy storage and donor in the extracellular space. Studies on acidocalcisomes and mitochondria provided first insights into the enzymatic basis of eukaryotic polyP formation. In addition, a concerted action of alkaline phosphatase and adenylate kinase proved crucial for ADP\/ATP generation from polyP. PolyP added extracellularly to mammalian cells resulted in a 3-fold increase of ATP. The importance and mechanism of this phosphotransfer reaction for energy-consuming processes in the extracellular matrix are discussed. This review aims to give a critical overview about the formation and function of this unique polymer that is capable of storing (bio)chemically useful energy.","699":null,"700":"This article aims to review nature-inspired chemical sensors for enabling fast, relatively inexpensive, and minimally (or non-) invasive diagnostics and follow-up of the health conditions. It can be achieved via monitoring of biomarkers and volatile biomarkers, that are excreted from one or combination of body fluids (breath, sweat, saliva, urine, seminal fluid, nipple aspirate fluid, tears, stool, blood, interstitial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid). The first part of the review gives an updated compilation of the biomarkers linked with specific sickness and\/or sampling origin. The other part of the review provides a didactic examination of the concepts and approaches related to the emerging chemistries, sensing materials, and transduction techniques used for biomarker-based medical evaluations. The strengths and pitfalls of each approach are discussed and criticized. Future perspective with relation to the information and communication era is presented and discussed.","701":"Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is a physical phenomenon exhibited by nanoparticles of metals including coinage metals, alkali metals, aluminum, and some semiconductors which translates into electromagnetic, thermal, and chemical properties. In the past decade, LSPR has been taken advantage of in the context of catalysis.

The advantages of this approach include improved selectivity, enhanced reaction rates, and milder reaction conditions.

Recent emphasis is to visualize such pathways using appropriate small molecular reagents, dye-labeled proteins, and genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors that produce a luminescence ON response either on selective binding or on reacting with an analyte that is produced through a specific biochemical\/enzymatic transformation. Studying such enzymatic processes by probing the fluorescence response as the read-out signal is expected to provide important insights into crucial biochemical transformations induced by an enzyme in its native form. Many of such studies are extended for monitoring enzymatic transformations under in vitro or in vivo condition. A few of the recent reports reveal that such molecular probes are even capable of quantifying abnormal levels of enzymes in real-time and is linked to the key area of clinical diagnostics and chemical biology. A synchronized analysis of all such reports helps in developing a rationale for designing purpose-built molecular probes or chemodosimeters as well as newer reagents for studying crucial enzymatic process or quantification of the respective enzyme. In this review, an attempt will be there to highlight several recent bioimaging reagents and studies that have provided insights into crucial biochemical or enzymatic transformations.","703":"In the past decade, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) have attracted attention and interest from the scientific community due to their superior mechanical strength and flexibility, physical\/chemical properties, and multiple exciting functionalities.

In this article, we compare the performance of current state of the art AAEM fuel cells to proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and elucidate the sources of various overpotentials. While the continued development of highly conductive and thermally stable anion-exchange membranes is unambiguously a principal requirement, we attempt to put the focus on the challenges in electrocatalysis and interfacial charge transfer at an alkaline electrode\/electrolyte interface. Specifically, a critical analysis presented here details the (i) fundamental causes for higher overpotential in hydrogen oxidation reaction, (ii) mechanistic aspects of oxygen reduction reaction, (iii) carbonate anion poisoning, (iv) unique challenges arising from the specific adsorption of alkaline ionomer cation-exchange head groups on electrocatalysts surfaces, and (v) the potential of alternative small molecule fuel oxidation.

A variety of molecular motors that can move on tracks within cells have evolved to serve this role. How these motors interact with their tracks and how that, in turn, leads to the generation of force and movement is key to understanding the cellular roles that these motor-track systems serve. This review is focused on the best understood of these systems, which is the molecular motor myosin that moves on tracks of filamentous (F-) actin.

The realization of a rechargeable Ca battery technology primarily requires identification and development of suitable electrodes and electrolytes, which is why we here cover the progress starting from the fundamental electrode\/electrolyte requirements, concepts, materials, and compositions employed and finally a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art, allowing us to conclude with the particular roadblocks still existing. As for crucial breakthroughs, reversible plating and stripping of calcium at the metal-anode interface was achieved only recently and for very specific electrolyte formulations. Therefore, while much of the current research aims at finding suitable cathodes to achieve proof-of-concept for a full Ca battery, the spectrum of electrolytes researched is also expanded. Compatibility of cell components is essential, and to ensure this, proper characterization is needed, which requires design of a multitude of reliable experimental setups and sometimes methodology development beyond that of other next generation battery technologies. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future strategies to make best use of the current advances in materials science combined with computational design, electrochemistry, and battery engineering, all to propel the Ca battery technology to reality and ultimately reach its full potential for energy storage.","710":"Molecular motors are diverse enzymes that transduce chemical energy into mechanical work and, in doing so, perform critical cellular functions such as DNA replication and transcription, DNA supercoiling, intracellular transport, and ATP synthesis. Single-molecule techniques have been extensively used to identify structural intermediates in the reaction cycles of molecular motors and to understand how substeps in energy consumption drive transitions between the intermediates. Here, we review a broad spectrum of single-molecule tools and techniques such as optical and magnetic tweezers, atomic force microscopy (AFM), single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), nanopore tweezers, and hybrid techniques that increase the number of observables. These methods enable the manipulation of individual biomolecules via the application of forces and torques and the observation of dynamic conformational changes in single motor complexes. We also review how these techniques have been applied to study various motors such as helicases, DNA and RNA polymerases, topoisomerases, nucleosome remodelers, and motors involved in the condensation, segregation, and digestion of DNA. In-depth analysis of mechanochemical coupling in molecular motors has made the development of artificially engineered motors possible. We review techniques such as mutagenesis, chemical modifications, and optogenetics that have been used to re-engineer existing molecular motors to have, for instance, altered speed, processivity, or functionality.

Some of these oxidation products then condense into the particle phase. Oxidation products that transform into the particle phase by this route are termed secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Understanding the route by which particulate matter is formed from these reactions is a key challenge in atmospheric chemistry. The principal understanding of SOA formation is derived from studies in laboratory chambers, for which determination of the amount of SOA formed requires a rigorous, quantitative understanding of chamber phenomena. With computational simulation of the processes occurring within an environmental chamber, the extrapolation to atmospheric conditions can be assessed. Moreover, computational chamber modeling of secondary organic aerosol formation will become an integral part of experimental design and data analysis. Here, we present a comprehensive review of processes involved in laboratory chamber SOA formation with a focus on the coupling between different physicochemical processes and understanding that has recently emerged.","716":"This review article will consider the preparation and application of ynones in synthetic organic chemistry.

A typical Conus venom contains hundreds to thousands of bioactive peptides known as conotoxins. These mostly disulfide-rich and well-structured peptides act on a wide range of targets such as ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, transporters, and enzymes. Conotoxins are of interest to neuroscientists as well as drug developers due to their exquisite potency and selectivity, not just against prey but also mammalian targets, thereby providing a rich source of molecular probes and therapeutic leads. The rise of integrated venomics has accelerated conotoxin discovery with now well over 10,000 conotoxin sequences published.

A kind of revolution in heterogeneous catalysis by metals for which it was assumed that specific sites or defects of a nanoparticle were necessary to activate substrates in catalytic reactions. In another extreme of the spectrum, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), and, by extension, surface organometallic catalysis (SOMCat), have demonstrated that single atoms on a surface, but this time with specific ligands, could lead to a more predictive approach in heterogeneous catalysis. The predictive character of SOMCat was just the result of intuitive mechanisms derived from the elementary steps of molecular chemistry. This review article will compare the aspects of single atom catalysis and surface organometallic catalysis by considering several specific catalytic reactions, some of which exist for both fields, whereas others might see mutual overlap in the future. After a definition of both domains, a detailed approach of the methods, mostly modeling and spectroscopy, will be followed by a detailed analysis of catalytic reactions: hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, oxidative dehydrogenation, alkane and cycloalkane metathesis, methane activation, metathetic oxidation, CO2 activation to cyclic carbonates, imine metathesis, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reactions. A prospective resulting from present knowledge is showing the emergence of a new discipline from the overlap between the two areas.","721":"On-line analysis of exhaled breath offers insight into a person's metabolism without the need for sample preparation or sample collection. Due to its noninvasive nature and the possibility to sample continuously, the analysis of breath has great clinical potential. The unique features of this technology make it an attractive candidate for applications in medicine, beyond the task of diagnosis. We review the current methodologies for on-line breath analysis, discuss current and future applications, and critically evaluate challenges and pitfalls such as the need for standardization. Special emphasis is given to the use of the technology in diagnosing respiratory diseases, potential niche applications, and the promise of breath analysis for personalized medicine. The analytical methodologies used range from very small and low-cost chemical sensors, which are ideal for continuous monitoring of disease status, to optical spectroscopy and state-of-the-art, high-resolution mass spectrometry. The latter can be utilized for untargeted analysis of exhaled breath, with the capability to identify hitherto unknown molecules. The interpretation of the resulting big data sets is complex and often constrained due to a limited number of participants. Even larger data sets will be needed for assessing reproducibility and for validation of biomarker candidates. In addition, molecular structures and quantification of compounds are generally not easily available from on-line measurements and require complementary measurements, for example, a separation method coupled to mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a lack of standardization still hampers the application of the technique to screen larger cohorts of patients. This review summarizes the present status and continuous improvements of the principal on-line breath analysis methods and evaluates obstacles for their wider application.","722":"This review sets out to understand the reactivity of diradicals and how that may differ from monoradicals. In the first part of the review, we delineate the electronic structure of a diradical with its two degenerate or nearly degenerate molecular orbitals, occupied by two electrons. A classification of diradicals based on whether or not the two SOMOs can be located on different sites of the molecule is useful in determining the ground state spin. Important is a delocalized to localized orbital transformation that interchanges \"closed-shell\" to \"open-shell\" descriptions. The resulting duality is useful in understanding the dual reactivity of singlet diradicals. In the second part of the review, we examine, with a consistent level of theory, activation energies of prototypical radical reactions (dimerization, hydrogen abstraction, and addition to ethylene) for representative organic diradicals and diradicaloids in their two lowest spin states. Differences and similarities in reactivity of diradicals vs monoradicals, based on either a localized or delocalized view, whichever is suitable, are then discussed. The last part of this review begins with an extensive, comparative, and critical survey of available measures of diradical character and ends with an analysis of the consequences of diradical character for selected diradicaloids.","723":null,"724":"The surface and interfaces of heterogeneous catalysts are essential to their performance as they are often considered to be active sites for catalytic reactions. With the development of nanoscience, the ability to tune surface and interface of nanostructures has provided a versatile tool for the development and optimization of a heterogeneous catalyst. In this Review, we present the surface and interface control of nanoparticle catalysts in the context of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR), and tandem catalysis in three sections. In the first section, we start with the activity of ORR on the nanoscale surface and then focus on the approaches to optimize the performance of Pt-based catalyst including using alloying, core-shell structure, and high surface area open structures. In the section of CO2 RR, where the surface composition of the catalysts plays a dominant role, we cover its reaction fundamentals and the performance of different nanosized metal catalysts. For tandem catalysis, where adjacent catalytic interfaces in a single nanostructure catalyze sequential reactions, we describe its concept and principle, catalyst synthesis methodology, and application in different reactions.","725":null,"726":"The support plays an important role for supported metal catalysts by positioning itself as a macromolecular ligand, which conditions the nature of the active site and contributes indirectly but also sometimes directly to the reactivity. Metal species such as nanoparticles, clusters, or single atoms can be deposited on carbon materials for various catalytic reactions. All the carbon materials used as catalyst support constitute a large family of compounds that can vary both at textural and at structural levels.

To do this, we will rely on both experimental and theoretical studies. We will first analyze what sites are available on the surface of a carbon support for the anchoring of the active phase. Then, we will describe some important effects in catalysis inherent to the presence of a carbon-type support (metal-support interaction, confinement, spillover, and surface functional group effects). These effects will be commented on by putting into perspective catalytic results obtained in numerous reactions of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, or photocatalysis.","727":"Development of biosensing platforms plays a key role in research settings for identification of biomarkers and in clinical applications for diagnostics.

Particularly, confined dimensions play important roles in determining the properties of nanomaterials, such as the kinetics of ion diffusion, the magnitude of strain\/stress, and the utilization of active materials. Nanowires, as one of the representative one-dimensional nanomaterials, have great capability for realizing a variety of applications in the fields of energy storage since they could maintain electron transport along the long axis and have a confinement effect across the diameter.

Dendritic design allows us to present peptides in a branched three-dimensional fashion that eventually leads to a globular shape, thus mimicking globular proteins. Peptide dendrimers, unlike other classes of dendrimers, have immense applications in biomedical research due to their biological origin. The diversity of potential building blocks and innumerable possibilities for design, along with the fact that the area is relatively underexplored, make peptide dendrimers sought-after candidates for various applications. This review summarizes the stepwise evolution of peptidic dendrimers along with their multifaceted applications in various fields. Further, the introduction of biomacromolecules such as proteins to a dendritic scaffold, resulting in complex macromolecules with discrete molecular weights, is an altogether new addition to the area of organic chemistry.

A dendrimer of polydentate ligands assembles metal ions or salts into the interior allowing production of metal nanoparticles in the dendrimer. The dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) exhibit unique and remarkable catalytic properties depending on the size and elemental formula. Recent advances in dendrimer chemistry even enabled the atom precise synthesis of subnanometer metal clusters that have been impossible to prepare by wet chemical methods. In addition, not only for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles and clusters, the dendrimer itself can also provide the modulation of activity and selectivity in the catalysis.

In biological systems, these fascinating molecules are responsible for movement of molecules, organelles, cells, and whole animals. In engineered systems, these motors can potentially be used to power actuators and engines, shuttle cargo to sensors, and enable new computing paradigms. Here, we review the progress in the past decade in the integration of biomolecular motors into hybrid nanosystems. After briefly introducing the motor proteins kinesin and myosin and their associated cytoskeletal filaments, we review recent work aiming for the integration of these biomolecular motors into actuators, sensors, and computing devices. In some systems, the creation of mechanical work and the processing of information become intertwined at the molecular scale, creating a fascinating type of \"active matter\". We discuss efforts to optimize biomolecular motor performance, construct new motors combining artificial and biological components, and contrast biomolecular motors with current artificial molecular motors. A recurrent theme in the work of the past decade was the induction and utilization of collective behavior between motile systems powered by biomolecular motors, and we discuss these advances. The exertion of external control over the motile structures powered by biomolecular motors has remained a topic of many studies describing exciting progress. Finally, we review the current limitations and challenges for the construction of hybrid systems powered by biomolecular motors and try to ascertain if there are theoretical performance limits.

Last, challenges and opportunities in single molecule photocatalysis on TiO2 are discussed briefly.","736":"Life on Earth evolved in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, and other peroxides also emerged before and with the rise of aerobic metabolism. They were considered only as toxic byproducts for many years. Nowadays, peroxides are also regarded as metabolic products that play essential physiological cellular roles. Organisms have developed efficient mechanisms to metabolize peroxides, mostly based on two kinds of redox chemistry, catalases\/peroxidases that depend on the heme prosthetic group to afford peroxide reduction and thiol-based peroxidases that support their redox activities on specialized fast reacting cysteine\/selenocysteine (Cys\/Sec) residues. Among the last group, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) and peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are the most widespread and abundant families, and they are the leitmotif of this review. After presenting the properties and roles of different peroxides in biology, we discuss the chemical mechanisms of peroxide reduction by low molecular weight thiols, Prxs, GPxs, and other thiol-based peroxidases. Special attention is paid to the catalytic properties of Prxs and also to the importance and comparative outlook of the properties of Sec and its role in GPxs. To finish, we describe and discuss the current views on the activities of thiol-based peroxidases in peroxide-mediated redox signaling processes.","737":"The success of halide perovskites in a host of optoelectronic applications is often attributed to their long photoexcited carrier lifetimes, which has led to charge-carrier recombination processes being described as unique compared to other semiconductors. Here, we integrate recent literature findings to provide a critical assessment of the factors we believe are most likely controlling recombination in the most widely studied halide perovskite systems. We focus on four mechanisms that have been proposed to affect measured charge carrier recombination lifetimes, namely: (1) recombination via trap states, (2) polaron formation, (3) the indirect nature of the bandgap (e.g., Rashba effect), and (4) photon recycling. We scrutinize the evidence for each case and the implications of each process on carrier recombination dynamics. Although they have attracted considerable speculation, we conclude that multiple trapping or hopping in shallow trap states, and the possible indirect nature of the bandgap (e.g., Rashba effect), seem to be less likely given the combined evidence, at least in high-quality samples most relevant to solar cells and light-emitting diodes. On the other hand, photon recycling appears to play a clear role in increasing apparent lifetime for samples with high photoluminescence quantum yields. We conclude that polaron dynamics are intriguing and deserving of further study. We highlight potential interdependencies of these processes and suggest future experiments to better decouple their relative contributions. A more complete understanding of the recombination processes could allow us to rationally tailor the properties of these fascinating semiconductors and will aid the discovery of other materials exhibiting similarly exceptional optoelectronic properties.","738":"The adult myocardium has a limited regenerative capacity following heart injury, and the lost cells are primarily replaced by fibrotic scar tissue. Suboptimal efficiency of current clinical therapies to resurrect the infarcted heart results in injured heart enlargement and remodeling to maintain its physiological functions. These remodeling processes ultimately leads to ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF). Recent therapeutic approaches (e.g., regenerative and nanomedicine) have shown promise to prevent HF postmyocardial infarction in animal models. However, these preclinical, clinical, and technological advancements have yet to yield substantial enhancements in the survival rate and quality of life of patients with severe ischemic injuries. This could be attributed largely to the considerable gap in knowledge between clinicians and nanobioengineers. Development of highly effective cardiac regenerative therapies requires connecting and coordinating multiple fields, including cardiology, cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry and chemistry, and mechanical and materials sciences, among others. This review is particularly intended to bridge the knowledge gap between cardiologists and regenerative nanomedicine experts. Establishing this multidisciplinary knowledge base may help pave the way for developing novel, safer, and more effective approaches that will enable the medical community to reduce morbidity and mortality in HF patients.","739":"Practical challenges in simulating quantum systems on classical computers have been widely recognized in the quantum physics and quantum chemistry communities over the past century.

Highly functionalized amines with multiple stereogenic centers can be efficiently accessed via the Petasis reaction with high levels of both diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. By drawing attention to examples reported in the past 8 years, this Review demonstrates the breadth of the reactivity and synthetic applications of Petasis reactions in several frontiers: the expansion of the substrate scope in the classic three-component process; nonclassic Petasis reactions with additional components; Petasis-type reactions with noncanonical substrates, mechanism, and products; new asymmetric versions assisted by chiral catalysts; combinations with a secondary or tertiary transformation in a cascade- or sequence-specific manner to access structurally complex, natural-product-like heterocycles; and the synthesis of polyhydroxy alkaloids and biologically interesting molecules.","741":"Fluorine does not belong to the pool of chemical elements that nature uses to build organic matter. However, chemists have exploited the unique properties of fluorine and produced countless fluoro-organic compounds without which our everyday lives would be unimaginable. The incorporation of fluorine into amino acids established a completely new class of amino acids and their properties, and those of the biopolymers constructed from them are extremely interesting. Increasing interest in this class of amino acids caused the demand for robust and stereoselective synthetic protocols that enable straightforward access to these building blocks. Herein, we present a comprehensive account of the literature in this field going back to 1995. We place special emphasis on a particular fluorination strategy. The four main sections describe fluorinated versions of alkyl, cyclic, aromatic amino acids, and also nickel-complexes to access them. We progress by one carbon unit increments. Special cases of amino acids for which there is no natural counterpart are described at the end of each section. Synthetic access to each of the amino acids is summarized in form of a table at the end of this article with the aim to make the information easily accessible to the reader.","742":null,"743":"Small cyclic peptides possess a wide range of biological properties and unique structures that make them attractive to scientists working in a range of areas from medicinal to materials chemistry. However, cyclic tetrapeptides (CTPs), which are important members of this family, are notoriously difficult to synthesize. Various synthetic methodologies have been developed that enable access to natural product CTPs and their rationally designed synthetic analogues having novel molecular structures. These methodologies include the use of reversible protecting groups such as pseudoprolines that restrict conformational freedom, ring contraction strategies, on-resin cyclization approaches, and optimization of coupling reagents and reaction conditions such as temperature and dilution factors. Several fundamental studies have documented the impacts of amino acid configurations, N-alkylation, and steric bulk on both synthetic success and ensuing conformations. Carefully executed retrosynthetic ring dissection and the unique structural features of the linear precursor sequences that result from the ring dissection are crucial for the success of the cyclization step. Other factors that influence the outcome of the cyclization step include reaction temperature, solvent, reagents used as well as dilution levels. The purpose of this review is to highlight the current state of affairs on naturally occurring and rationally designed cyclic tetrapeptides, including strategies investigated for their syntheses in the literature, the conformations adopted by these molecules, and specific examples of their function. Using selected examples from the literature, an in-depth discussion of the synthetic techniques and reaction parameters applied for the successful syntheses of 12-, 13-, and 14-membered natural product CTPs and their novel analogues are presented, with particular focus on the cyclization step. Selected examples of the three-dimensional structures of cyclic tetrapeptides studied by NMR, and X-ray crystallography are also included.","744":"Directed motion at the nanoscale is a central attribute of life, and chemically driven motor proteins are nature's choice to accomplish it. Motivated and inspired by such bionanodevices, in the past few decades chemists have developed artificial prototypes of molecular motors, namely, multicomponent synthetic species that exhibit directionally controlled, stimuli-induced movements of their parts. In this context, photonic and redox stimuli represent highly appealing modes of activation, particularly from a technological viewpoint. Here we describe the evolution of the field of photo- and redox-driven artificial molecular motors, and we provide a comprehensive review of the work published in the past 5 years. After an analysis of the general principles that govern controlled and directed movement at the molecular scale, we describe the fundamental photochemical and redox processes that can enable its realization. The main classes of light- and redox-driven molecular motors are illustrated, with a particular focus on recent designs, and a thorough description of the functions performed by these kinds of devices according to literature reports is presented. Limitations, challenges, and future perspectives of the field are critically discussed.","745":"Selective catalytic reduction with NH3 (NH3-SCR) is the most efficient technology to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from coal-fired industries, diesel engines, etc. Although V2O5-WO3(MoO3)\/TiO2 and CHA structured zeolite catalysts have been utilized in commercial applications, the increasing requirements for broad working temperature window, strong SO2\/alkali\/heavy metal-resistance, and high hydrothermal stability have stimulated the development of new-type NH3-SCR catalysts. This review summarizes the latest SCR reaction mechanisms and emerging poison-resistant mechanisms in the beginning and subsequently gives a comprehensive overview of newly developed SCR catalysts, including metal oxide catalysts ranging from VOx, MnOx, CeO2, and Fe2O3 to CuO based catalysts; acidic compound catalysts containing vanadate, phosphate and sulfate catalysts; ion exchanged zeolite catalysts such as Fe, Cu, Mn, etc. exchanged zeolite catalysts; monolith catalysts including extruded, washcoated, and metal-mesh\/foam-based monolith catalysts. The challenges and opportunities for each type of catalysts are proposed while the effective strategies are summarized for enhancing the acidity\/redox circle and poison-resistance through modification, creating novel nanostructures, exposing specific crystalline planes, constructing protective\/sacrificial sites, etc. Some suggestions are given about future research directions that efforts should be made in. Hopefully, this review can bridge the gap between newly developed catalysts and practical requirements to realize their commercial applications in the near future.","746":null,"747":"The conformational analysis of macrocycles is a complex and challenging problem. There are many factors that contribute to this complexity. These include a large number of degrees of freedom, transannular interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, and a range of steric interactions, along with ring strain effects. To a greater extent than within acyclic molecules, these interactions within macrocycles are coupled such that changing one dihedral angle can significantly affect other dihedral angles, further complicating the situation. However, this coupling of bond rotations and transannular interactions enables the transmission of three-dimensional information from one side of a macrocycle to the other. Making relatively small structural modifications to a macrocycle can result in local conformational changes that propagate along the ring to affect distal structural features. The factors that control how such changes can propagate are poorly understood, and it is difficult to predict which modifications will result in significant conformational reorganizations of remote regions of a macrocycle. This review discusses examples where small structural modifications to macrocyclic scaffolds change the conformational preferences of structurally remote regions of the ring. We will highlight evidence provided for conformational changes triggered by remote substituents and explanations of how these changes might occur in an effort to further understand the factors that control such phenomena.","748":"Biomolecular machines are protein complexes that convert between different forms of free energy. They are utilized in nature to accomplish many cellular tasks. As isothermal nonequilibrium stochastic objects at low Reynolds number, they face a distinct set of challenges compared with more familiar human-engineered macroscopic machines. Here we review central questions in their performance as free energy transducers, outline theoretical and modeling approaches to understand these questions, identify both physical limits on their operational characteristics and design principles for improving performance, and discuss emerging areas of research.","749":"","750":"Metal-ligand cooperation, in which metal and ligand participate in bond cleavage and formation, is gathering great attention in recent years. In contrast to the classical bond cleavage by active metal centers with spectator ligands, metal-ligand cooperation has enabled unprecedented reactivities. Especially, metal-ligand cooperative H-H bond cleavage has been extensively studied and applied to various catalysts. On the other hand, there are substantial efforts to expand the scope of the bond to be cleaved other than the H-H bond. This review summarizes the recent progress in the metal-ligand cooperative cleavages of Si-H, B-H, and C-H bonds and their catalytic applications.","751":"The uranyl ion, [UVIO2]2+, possesses rigorously trans, strongly covalent, and chemically robust U-oxo groups. However, through the use of anaerobic reaction techniques, both one- and two-electron reductive functionalization of the uranyl oxo groups has been discovered and developed. Prior to 2010, this unusual reactivity centered around the reductive silylation of the uranyl ion which entailed conversion of the oxo ligands into siloxy ligands and reductive metalation of the uranyl oxo with Group 1 and f-block metals. This review surveys the large number of new examples of reductive functionalization of the uranyl ion that have been reported since 2010, including reductive borylation and alumination, metalation with d- or f-block metals, and new examples of reductive silylation. Other examples of oxo-group functionalization of [UVIO2]2+ that do not involve reduction, mainly with Group 1 cations, are also covered, along with new advances in the photochemistry of the uranyl(VI) ion that involve the transient formation of formally uranyl(V) [UVO2]+ ion.","752":"Solar-driven water splitting provides a leading approach to store the abundant yet intermittent solar energy and produce hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy carrier. A straightforward route to light-driven water splitting is to apply self-supported particulate photocatalysts, which is expected to allow solar hydrogen to be competitive with fossil-fuel-derived hydrogen on a levelized cost basis. More importantly, the powder-based systems can lend themselves to making functional panels on a large scale while retaining the intrinsic activity of the photocatalyst. However, all attempts to generate hydrogen via powder-based solar water-splitting systems to date have unfortunately fallen short of the efficiency values required for practical applications. Photocatalysis on photocatalyst particles involves three sequential steps: (i) absorption of photons with higher energies than the bandgap of the photocatalysts, leading to the excitation of electron-hole pairs in the particles, (ii) charge separation and migration of these photoexcited carriers, and (iii) surface chemical reactions based on these carriers. In this review, we focus on the challenges of each step and summarize material design strategies to overcome the obstacles and limitations. This review illustrates that it is possible to employ the fundamental principles underlying photosynthesis and the tools of chemical and materials science to design and prepare photocatalysts for overall water splitting.","753":"Low-dimensional semiconductor materials structures, where nanowires are needle-like one-dimensional examples, have developed into one of the most intensely studied fields of science and technology. The subarea described in this review is compound semiconductor nanowires, with the materials covered limited to III-V materials (like GaAs, InAs, GaP, InP,...) and III-nitride materials (GaN, InGaN, AlGaN,...). We review the way in which several innovative synthesis methods constitute the basis for the realization of highly controlled nanowires, and we combine this perspective with one of how the different families of nanowires can contribute to applications. One reason for the very intense research in this field is motivated by what they can offer to main-stream semiconductors, by which ultrahigh performing electronic (e.g., transistors) and photonic (e.g., photovoltaics, photodetectors or LEDs) technologies can be merged with silicon and CMOS. Other important aspects, also covered in the review, deals with synthesis methods that can lead to dramatic reduction of cost of fabrication and opportunities for up-scaling to mass production methods.","754":"Alcohols, in particular polyols, are well-known for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles, often acting as reducing agents, solvents, and stabilizers. Given not only their structural flexibility depending on the number of OH functions and their inherent H bonding interactions, but also the wide range of polyol molecular weights readily available, different physicochemical properties (boiling point, polarity, viscosity) could be exploited toward the synthesis of well-defined nanomaterials. In particular, the relevance of the supramolecular structure of polyols has a fundamental impact on the formation of metal nanoparticles, thereby favoring the dispersion of the nanoclusters. In the field of the metal-based nanocatalysis, palladium occupies a privileged position mainly due to its remarkable versatility in terms of reactivity representing a foremost tool in synthesis. In this review, we describe the controlled synthesis of Pd-based nanoparticles in polyol medium, focusing on the progress in terms of tailoring size, morphology, structure, and surface state. Moreover, we discuss the use of palladium nanoparticles, in a polyol solvent, applied in two of the most relevant Pd-catalyzed processes, i.e., couplings and hydrogenation reactions, including multistep processes.","755":"With the fast development of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the last 30 years, semiconductor nanowires have been widely investigated in the areas of both electronics and optoelectronics. Among them, representatives of third generation semiconductors, such as ZnO and GaN, have relatively large spontaneous polarization along their longitudinal direction of the nanowires due to the asymmetric structure in their c-axis direction. Two-way or multiway couplings of piezoelectric, photoexcitation, and semiconductor properties have generated new research areas, such as piezotronics and piezo-phototronics. In this review, an in-depth discussion of the mechanisms and applications of nanowire-based piezotronics and piezo-phototronics is presented. Research on piezotronics and piezo-phototronics has drawn much attention since the effective manipulation of carrier transport, photoelectric properties, etc. through the application of simple mechanical stimuli and, conversely, since the design of new strain sensors based on the strain-induced change in semiconductor properties.","756":"Food safety is a prevalent concern around the world. As such, detection, removal, and control of risks and hazardous substances present from harvest to consumption will always be necessary. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of functional materials, possess unique physical and chemical properties, demonstrating promise in food safety applications. In this review, the synthesis and porosity of MOFs are first introduced by some representative examples that pertain to the field of food safety. Following that, the application of MOFs and MOF-based materials in food safety monitoring, food processing, covering preservation, sanitation, and packaging is overviewed. Future perspectives, as well as potential opportunities and challenges faced by MOFs in this field will also be discussed. This review aims to promote the development and progress of MOF chemistry and application research in the field of food safety, potentially leading to novel solutions.","757":"Semiconductor nanowires have attracted extensive interest as one of the best-defined classes of nanoscale building blocks for the bottom-up assembly of functional electronic and optoelectronic devices over the past two decades. The article provides a comprehensive review of the continuing efforts in exploring semiconductor nanowires for the assembly of functional nanoscale electronics and macroelectronics. Specifically, we start with a brief overview of the synthetic control of various semiconductor nanowires and nanowire heterostructures with precisely controlled physical dimension, chemical composition, heterostructure interface, and electronic properties to define the material foundation for nanowire electronics. We then summarize a series of assembly strategies developed for creating well-ordered nanowire arrays with controlled spatial position, orientation, and density, which are essential for constructing increasingly complex electronic devices and circuits from synthetic semiconductor nanowires. Next, we review the fundamental electronic properties and various single nanowire transistor concepts. Combining the designable electronic properties and controllable assembly approaches, we then discuss a series of nanoscale devices and integrated circuits assembled from nanowire building blocks, as well as a unique design of solution-processable nanowire thin-film transistors for high-performance large-area flexible electronics. Last, we conclude with a brief perspective on the standing challenges and future opportunities.","758":null,"759":"","760":"Recent applications of photoelectrochemistry at the semiconductor\/liquid interface provide a renewable route of mimicking natural photosynthesis and yielding chemicals from sunlight, water, and air. Nanowires, defined as one-dimensional nanostructures, exhibit multiple unique features for photoelectrochemical applications and promise better performance as compared to their bulk counterparts. This article reviews the use of semiconductor nanowires in photoelectrochemistry. After introducing fundamental concepts essential to understanding nanowires and photoelectrochemistry, the review considers answers to the following questions: (1) How can we interface semiconductor nanowires with other building blocks for enhanced photoelectrochemical responses? (2) How are nanowires utilized for photoelectrochemical half reactions? (3) What are the techniques that allow us to obtain fundamental insights of photoelectrochemistry at single-nanowire level? (4) What are the design strategies for an integrated nanosystem that mimics a closed cycle in artificial photosynthesis? This framework should help readers evaluate the salient features of nanowires for photoelectrochemical applications, promoting the sustainable development of solar-powered chemical plants that will benefit our society in the long run.","761":"Cyclic peptides have been attracting a lot of attention in recent decades, especially in the area of drug discovery, as more and more naturally occurring cyclic peptides with diverse biological activities have been discovered. Chemical synthesis of cyclic peptides is essential when studying their structure-activity relationships. Conventional peptide cyclization methods via direct coupling have inherent limitations, like the susceptibility to epimerization at the C-terminus, poor solubility of fully protected peptide precursors, and low yield caused by oligomerization. In this regard, chemoselective ligation-mediated cyclization methods have emerged as effective strategies for cyclic peptide synthesis. The toolbox for cyclic peptide synthesis has been expanded substantially in the past two decades, allowing more efficient synthesis of cyclic peptides with various scaffolds and modifications. This Review will explore different chemoselective ligation technologies used for cyclic peptide synthesis that generate both native and unnatural peptide linkages. The practical issues and limitations of different methods will be discussed. The advance in cyclic peptide synthesis will benefit the biological and medicinal study of cyclic peptides, an important class of macrocycles with potentials in numerous fields, notably in therapeutics.","762":"Coumarins are a very large family of compounds containing the unique 2H-chromen-2-one motif, as it is known according to IUPAC nomenclature. Coumarin derivatives are widely found in nature, especially in plants and are constituents of several essential oils. Up to now, thousands of coumarin derivatives have been isolated from nature or produced by chemists. More recently, the coumarin platform has been widely adopted in the design of small-molecule fluorescent chemosensors because of its excellent biocompatibility, strong and stable fluorescence emission, and good structural flexibility. This scaffold has found wide applications in the development of fluorescent chemosensors in the fields of molecular recognition, molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, materials chemistry, as well as in the biology and medical science communities. This review focuses on the important progress of coumarin-based small-molecule fluorescent chemosensors during the period of 2012-2018. This comprehensive and critical review may facilitate the development of more powerful fluorescent chemosensors for broad and exciting applications in the future.","763":"Calix[n]arenes (n = 4, 5, 6, 8) are \"chalicelike\" phenol-based macrocycles that are among the most fascinating and highly studied scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry. This stems from the functional and tunable diversity at both their upper and lower rims, their preorganized nonpolar cavities and preorganized ion-binding sites, and their well-defined conformations. Conjugation of calixarene scaffolds with various fluorogenic groups has led to the development of smart fluorescent probes that have been utilized as molecular sensors, in bioimaging, for drug and gene delivery, in self-assembly\/aggregation, and as smart materials. The fine-tuning and incorporation of different ligating sites in the calix[4]arene scaffold have produced numerous molecular sensors for cations, anions, and biomolecules. Moreover, the aqueous solubility of p-sulfonatocalix[4]arenes has engendered their potential use in drug\/gene delivery and enzymatic assays. In addition, because of their strong optical properties, fluorescent calix[4]arenes have been used to develop smart materials, including gels as well as nonlinear optical, organic light-emitting diode, and multiphoton materials. Finally, significant developments in the utility of fluorescent higher calixarenes have been made for bioapplications.

This review provides a comprehensive portrayal of these machine learning techniques and of their applications in medicinal chemistry. After introducing the basic principles, alongside some application notes, of the various machine learning algorithms, the current state-of-the art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is discussed, including applications in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, de novo drug design, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction, drug repurposing, and related aspects. Finally, several challenges and limitations of the current methods are summarized, with a view to potential future directions for AI-assisted drug discovery and design.","766":"Nanocarbons with different dimensions (e.g., 0D fullerenes and carbon nanodots, 1D carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons, 2D graphene and graphene oxides, and 3D nanodiamonds) have attracted enormous interest for applications ranging from electronics, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics to sensing, bioimaging, and therapeutics due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Among them, nanocarbon-based theranostics (i.e., therapeutics and diagnostics) is one of the most intensively studied applications, as these nanocarbon materials serve as excellent biosensors, versatile drug\/gene carriers for specific targeting in vivo, effective photothermal nanoagents for cancer therapy, and promising fluorescent nanolabels for cell and tissue imaging. This review provides a systematic overview of the latest theranostic applications of nanocarbon materials with a comprehensive comparison of the characteristics of different nanocarbon materials and their influences on theranostic applications. We first introduce the different carbon allotropes that can be used for theranostic applications with their respective preparation and surface functionalization approaches as well as their physical and chemical properties. Theranostic applications are described separately for both in vitro and in vivo systems by highlighting the protocols and the studied biosystems, followed by the toxicity and biodegradability implications. Finally, this review outlines the design considerations for nanocarbon materials as the key unifying themes that will serve as a foundational first principle for researchers to study, investigate, and generate effective, biocompatible, and nontoxic nanocarbon materials-based models for cancer theranostics applications. Finally, we summarize the review with an outlook on the challenges and novel theranostic protocols using nanocarbon materials for hard-to-treat cancers and other diseases. This review intends to present a comprehensive guideline for researchers in nanotechnology and biomedicine on the selection strategy of nanocarbon materials according to their specific requirements.","767":"All-photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for future systems beyond the limitation of Moore's law. Over the last several decades, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires have demonstrated great potential in photonic circuitry because of their unique 1D structure to effectively generate and tightly confine optical signals as well as easily tunable optical properties. In this Review, we categorize nanowires based on the optical properties (i.e., semiconducting, metallic, and dielectric nanowires) for their potential photonic applications (as light emitters or plasmonic and photonic waveguides). We further discuss the recent efforts in integration of nanowire-based photonic elements toward next-generation optical information processors. However, there are still several challenges remaining before the nanowires are fully utilized as photonic building blocks. The scientific and technical challenges and outlooks are provided to indicate the future directions.","768":"Multichromophoric biosystems represent a broad family with very diverse members, ranging from light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes to nucleic acids. The former are designed to capture, harvest, efficiently transport, and transform energy from sunlight for photosynthesis, while the latter should dissipate the absorbed radiation as quickly as possible to prevent photodamages and corruption of the carried genetic information. Because of the unique electronic and structural characteristics, the modeling of their photoinduced activity is a real challenge. Numerous approaches have been devised building on the theoretical development achieved for single chromophores and on model Hamiltonians that capture the essential features of the system. Still, a question remains: is a general strategy for the accurate modeling of multichromophoric systems possible? By using a quantum chemical point of view, here we review the advancements developed so far highlighting differences and similarities with the single chromophore treatment. Finally, we outline the important limitations and challenges that still need to be tackled to reach a complete and accurate picture of their photoinduced properties and dynamics.","769":"The focus of this review is the presentation of the most important aspects of chemical bonding in molecules of the main group atoms according to the current state of knowledge. Special attention is given to the difference between the physical mechanism of covalent bond formation and its description with chemical bonding models, which are often confused. This is partly due to historical reasons, since until the development of quantum theory there was no physical basis for understanding the chemical bond. In the absence of such a basis, chemists developed heuristic models that proved extremely valuable for understanding and predicting experimental studies. The great success of these simple models and the associated rules led to the fact that the model conceptions were regarded as real images of physical reality. The complicated world of quantum theory, which eludes human imagination, made it difficult to link heuristic models of chemical bonding with quantum chemical knowledge. In the early days of quantum chemistry, some suggestions were made which have since proved untenable. In recent decades, there has been a stormy development of quantum chemical methods, which are not limited to the quantitative accuracy of the calculated properties. Also, methods have been developed where the experimentally developed models can be quantitatively expressed and visually represented using mathematically well-defined terms that are derived from quantum chemical calculations. The calculated numbers may however not be measurable values. Nevertheless, as orientation data for the interpretation and classification of experimental findings as well as a guideline for new experiments, they form a coordinate system that defines the multidimensional world of chemistry, which corresponds to the Hilbert space formalism of physics. The nonmeasurability of model values is not a weakness of chemistry but a characteristic by which the infinite complexity of the material world becomes scientifically accessible and very useful for chemical research. This review examines the basis of the commonly used quantum chemical methods for calculating molecules and for analyzing their electronic structure. The bonding situation in selected representative molecules of main-group atoms is discussed. The results are compared with textbook knowledge of common chemistry.","770":"Metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles, also called porous coordination polymers, are a major part of nanomaterials science, and their role in catalysis is becoming central. The extraordinary variability and richness of their structures afford engineering synergies between the metal nodes, functional linkers, encapsulated substrates, or nanoparticles for multiple and selective heterogeneous interactions and activations in these MOF-based nanocatalysts. Pyrolysis of MOF-nanoparticle composites forms highly porous N- or P-doped graphitized MOF-derived nanomaterials that are increasingly used as efficient catalysts especially in electro- and photocatalysis. This review first briefly summarizes this background of MOF nanoparticle catalysis and then comprehensively reviews the fast-growing literature reported during the last years. The major parts are catalysis of organic and molecular reactions, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and views of prospects. Major challenges of our society are addressed using these well-defined heterogeneous catalysts in the fields of synthesis, energy, and environment. In spite of the many achievements, enormous progress is still necessary to improve our understanding of the processes involved beyond the proof-of-concept, particularly for selective methane oxidation, hydrogen production, water splitting, CO2 reduction to methanol, nitrogen fixation, and water depollution.","771":"Membrane ion channels are the fundamental electrical components in the nervous system. Recent developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM microscopy have revealed what these proteins look like in atomic detail but do not tell us how they function. Molecular dynamics simulations have progressed to the point that we can now simulate realistic molecular assemblies to produce quantitative calculations of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities that control function. In this review, we summarize the state of atomistic simulation methods for ion channels to understand their conduction, activation, and drug modulation mechanisms. We are at a crossroads in atomistic simulation, where long time scale observation can provide unbiased exploration of mechanisms, supplemented by biased free energy methodologies. We illustrate the use of these approaches to describe ion conduction and selectivity in voltage-gated sodium and acid-sensing ion channels. Studies of channel gating present a significant challenge, as activation occurs on longer time scales. Enhanced sampling approaches can ensure convergence on minimum free energy pathways for activation, as illustrated here for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are principal to nervous system function and the actions of general anesthetics. We also examine recent studies of local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug binding to a sodium channel, revealing sites and pathways that may offer new targets for drug development. Modern simulations thus offer a range of molecular-level insights into ion channel function and modulation as a learning platform for mechanistic discovery and drug development.","772":"The founding in 1965 of what is now called the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) has reaped dividends in numerous and diverse areas of chemical research. Each of the million or so crystal structures in the database was solved for its own particular reason, but collected together, the structures can be reused to address a multitude of new problems. In this Review, which is focused mainly on the last 10 years, we chronicle the contribution of the CSD to research into molecular geometries, molecular interactions, and molecular assemblies and demonstrate its value in the design of biologically active molecules and the solid forms in which they are delivered. Its potential in other commercially relevant areas is described, including gas storage and delivery, thin films, and (opto)electronics. The CSD also aids the solution of new crystal structures. Because no scientific instrument is without shortcomings, the limitations of CSD research are assessed. We emphasize the importance of maintaining database quality: notwithstanding the arrival of big data and machine learning, it remains perilous to ignore the principle of garbage in, garbage out. Finally, we explain why the CSD must evolve with the world around it to ensure it remains fit for purpose in the years ahead.","773":"The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are a family of bacterial protein toxins specifically targeting eukaryotic cells through the absolute requirement for high concentrations of cholesterol in the target cells' lipid membrane. The soluble monomeric protein secreted by the bacteria oligomerizes on the surface of the target cell, and the complex formed then undergoes a concerted structural transition that results in the creation of a multimeric protein pore. Recognition of the cholesterol-rich membrane by CDCs is a surprisingly subtle process that takes place at the interface between the membrane and surrounding aqueous environment. The structure and composition of the lipid membrane modulates the efficiency with which the protein can identify cholesterol and alters the concentration of sterol required for membrane binding. Some of the details of the interplay between protein and membrane remain to be resolved, and in this review we present a current perspective on CDC pore formation, with particular focus on the role of the lipid bilayer and cholesterol accessibility.","774":"Macrocycles have long been recognized as useful chemical entities for medicine, with naturally occurring and synthetic macrocycles clinically approved for use as prescription drugs. Despite this promise, the synthesis of collections of macrocycles has been historically challenging due to difficulties in the formation of large rings. Diversity-Oriented Synthesis (DOS) emerged in the early 2000s as a powerful strategic solution to the construction of diverse molecular libraries. This review details the various strategies developed within the field of DOS for the synthesis of macrocycle libraries, utilizing modern synthetic methodology to deliver structurally diverse collections of macrocyclic molecules, and the exploration of their therapeutic potential. Section 1 of this work details the use of algorithmic strategies and is divided into Build\/Couple\/Pair, Advanced Build\/Couple\/Pair, Initiate\/Propagate\/Terminate, Fragment-Based Domain Shuffling, Two-Directional Synthesis, and Successive Ring Expansion. Section 2 covers strategies based on ring distortion reactions, including Sequential Cycloaddition\/Fragmentation, Ring Expansions, and Miscellaneous.","775":"Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM\/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM\/GBSA) are arguably very popular methods for binding free energy prediction since they are more accurate than most scoring functions of molecular docking and less computationally demanding than alchemical free energy methods. MM\/PBSA and MM\/GBSA have been widely used in biomolecular studies such as protein folding, protein-ligand binding, protein-protein interaction, etc. In this review, methods to adjust the polar solvation energy and to improve the performance of MM\/PBSA and MM\/GBSA calculations are reviewed and discussed. The latest applications of MM\/GBSA and MM\/PBSA in drug design are also presented. This review intends to provide readers with guidance for practically applying MM\/PBSA and MM\/GBSA in drug design and related research fields.","776":"The ever-increasing demands for clean and sustainable energy sources combined with rapid advances in biointegrated portable or implantable electronic devices have stimulated intensive research activities in enzymatic (bio)fuel cells (EFCs). The use of renewable biocatalysts, the utilization of abundant green, safe, and high energy density fuels, together with the capability of working at modest and biocompatible conditions make EFCs promising as next generation alternative power sources. However, the main challenges (low energy density, relatively low power density, poor operational stability, and limited voltage output) hinder future applications of EFCs. This review aims at exploring the underlying mechanism of EFCs and providing possible practical strategies, methodologies and insights to tackle these issues. First, this review summarizes approaches in achieving high energy densities in EFCs, particularly, employing enzyme cascades for the deep\/complete oxidation of fuels. Second, strategies for increasing power densities in EFCs, including increasing enzyme activities, facilitating electron transfers, employing nanomaterials, and designing more efficient enzyme-electrode interfaces, are described. The potential of EFCs\/(super)capacitor combination is discussed. Third, the review evaluates a range of strategies for improving the stability of EFCs, including the use of different enzyme immobilization approaches, tuning enzyme properties, designing protective matrixes, and using microbial surface displaying enzymes. Fourth, approaches for the improvement of the cell voltage of EFCs are highlighted. Finally, future developments and a prospective on EFCs are envisioned.","777":"Organosulfur compounds have long played a vital role in organic chemistry and in the development of novel chemical structures and architectures. Prominent among these organosulfur compounds are those involving a sulfur(IV) center, which have been the subject of countless investigations over more than a hundred years. In addition to a long list of textbook sulfur-based reactions, there has been a sustained interest in the chemistry of organosulfur(IV) compounds in recent years. Of particular interest within organosulfur chemistry is the ease with which the synthetic chemist can effect a wide range of transformations through either bond formation or bond cleavage at sulfur. This review aims to cover the developments of the past decade in the chemistry of organic sulfur(IV) molecules and provide insight into both the wide range of reactions which critically rely on this versatile element and the diverse scaffolds that can thereby be synthesized.","778":"This review is dedicated to the chemistry of stable and isolable species that bear two lone pairs at the same C center, i.e., geminal dianions, stabilized by main group elements. Three cases can thus be considered: the geminal-dilithio derivative, for which the two substituents at C are neutral, the yldiide derivatives, for which one substituent is neutral while the other is charged, and finally the geminal bisylides, for which the two substituents are positively charged. In this review, the syntheses and electronic structures of the geminal dianions are presented, followed by the studies dedicated to their reactivity toward organic substrates and finally to their coordination chemistry and applications.","779":"The past decade has witnessed an increasing interaction between experiment and theory in the field of molecular spectroscopy. On the computational side, ongoing developments of hardware and software have moved computational spectroscopy from a highly specialized research area to a general tool for researchers in different fields of chemical science. However, since its dawn, computational spectroscopy has been characterized by the dichotomies of qualitative and quantitative description, and of interpretation and accuracy. Indeed, the analysis of experiments is seldom straightforward because of the subtle interplay of several different effects, which are not easy to evaluate and isolate, and\/or the complexity of the system under consideration. Often, the accuracy has to be set aside for a more qualitative analysis that will provide the means for a broad interpretation. In such a scenario, the most recent advances in theoretical treatments as well as computational tools have opened the way to the reconciliation of accuracy and interpretability, resulting in unequivocal analyses and assignments of experimental spectra and their unbiased interpretation. This Review aims at being a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and readable account of general interest to the chemistry community because of the wealth of qualitative and quantitative information that can be obtained from spectroscopic investigations. Limiting ourselves to rotational and vibrational spectroscopy, emphasis will be put on accuracy and interpretability as well as on the routes toward their reconciliation and integration.","780":"","781":"At the advent of cross-coupling chemistry, carbon electrophiles based on halides or pseudohalides were the only suitable electrophilic coupling partners. Almost two decades passed before the first cross-coupling reaction of heteroatom-based electrophiles was reported. Early work by Murai and Tanaka initiated investigations into silicon electrophiles. Narasaka and Johnson pioneered the way in the use of nitrogen electrophiles, while Suginome began the exploration of boron electrophiles. The chemistry reviewed within provides perspective on the use of heteroatomic electrophiles, specifically silicon-, nitrogen-, boron-, oxygen-, and phosphorus-based electrophiles in transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling. For the purposes of this review, a loose definition of cross-coupling is utilized; all reactions minimally proceed via an oxidative addition event. Although not cross-coupling in a traditional sense, we have also included catalyzed reactions that join a heteroatomic electrophile with an in situ generated nucleophile. However, for brevity, those involving hydroamination or C-H activation as a key step are largely excluded. This work includes primary references published up to and including October 2018.","782":"","783":"Chiral salen-metal complexes are among the most versatile asymmetric catalysts and have found utility in fields ranging from materials chemistry to organic synthesis. These complexes are capable of inducing chirality in products formed from a wide variety of chemical processes, often with close to perfect stereoinduction. Salen ligands are tunable for steric as well as electronic properties, and their ability to coordinate a large number of metals gives the derived chiral salen-metal complex very broad utility in asymmetric catalysis. This review primarily summarizes developments in chiral salen-metal catalysis over the last two decades with particular emphasis on those applications of importance in asymmetric synthesis.","784":"Nanoparticle (NP)\/polymer nanocomposites received considerable attention because of their important applications including catalysis. Metal and metal oxide NPs may impart catalytic properties to polymer nanocomposites, while polymers with a different structure, functionality, and architecture control the NP formation (size, shape, location, composition, etc.) and in this way, govern catalytic properties of nanocomposites. In this review we will discuss the influence of the polymer nanostructure (thin or grafted layers, polymer ordering, polymer nanopores), architecture (branched vs linear), functional groups (coordinating or ionic), specific properties (reducing, stimuli responsive, conductive), etc. on the formation of metal or metal oxide NPs and the catalytic behavior of the nanocomposites. The development of novel and efficient catalysts is crucial for progress in chemical sciences, and this explains a huge number of publications in this area in recent years. Taking into consideration previous review articles on NP\/polymer catalysts, we limited this review to a discussion of a narrow temporal scope (2017-April 2019), while embracing a broad subject scope, i.e., considering any polymers and NPs which form catalytic nanocomposites. This gives us a unique view of the field of catalytic polymer nanocomposites and allows understanding of where the field is going.","785":"Self-assembly of supported 2D or 3D nanocrystals (NCs) by vacuum deposition and of 3D NCs by solution-phase synthesis (with possible subsequent transfer to a support) produces intrinsically nonequilibrium systems. Individual NCs can have far-from-equilibrium shapes and composition profiles. The free energy of NC ensembles is lowered by coarsening which can involve Ostwald ripening or Smoluchowski ripening (NC diffusion and coalescence). Preservation of individual NC structure and inhibition of coarsening are key, e.g., for avoiding catalyst degradation. This review focuses on postsynthesis evolution of metallic NCs. Atomistic-level modeling typically utilizes stochastic lattice-gas models to access appropriate time and length scales. However, predictive modeling requires incorporation of realistic rates for relaxation mechanisms, e.g., periphery diffusion and intermixing, in numerous local environments (rather than the use of generic prescriptions). Alternative coarse-grained modeling must also incorporate appropriate mechanisms and kinetics. At the level of individual NCs, we present analyses of reshaping, including sintering and pinch-off, and of compositional evolution in a vacuum environment. We also discuss modeling of coarsening including diffusion and decay of individual NCs and unconventional coarsening processes. We describe high-level modeling integrated with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies for supported 2D epitaxial nanoclusters and developments in modeling for 3D NCs motivated by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies.","786":"Heterogeneous catalysis occurs on the surface of a catalyst particle in a gas or liquid environment of reactants. The surface of the catalyst particle acts as an active chemical agent directly participating in a chemical reaction performed at a solid-gas or solid-liquid interface. Thus, authentic surface chemistry and the structure of a catalyst particle during catalysis are key descriptors for understanding catalytic performance of this catalyst. However, identification of the authentic surface of a catalyst particle during catalysis is not a simple task. We are far from knowing the fact. Photoelectron spectroscopy is one of the main techniques for characterizing surface of a catalyst since it's a surface sensitive technique. When used to track the surface of a catalyst particle at relatively high temperature in gas phase in the torr pressure range, it is called near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) or AP-XPS for simplicity. In the last several years, AP-XPS has been used to observe surface chemistry of catalysts of single crystals and nanoparticles of metal, metal oxide, and carbide. In this review, instrumentation of the near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectrometers and observation of catalyst surfaces in gases phase under reaction conditions and during catalysis with AP-XPS are discussed with the following objectives: (1) to present how the surface of a catalyst particle can be characterized in gas phase, (2) to interpret how surface chemistries observed during catalysis are correlated with measured catalytic performances, (3) to demonstrate how the uncovered correlations between surface structures and catalytic performances help to understand catalytic mechanisms at a molecular level, and (4) to discuss challenges and prospects of using AP-XPS to explore the authentic surface of a catalyst under a condition near to an industrial catalytic condition. This review focuses on the application of AP-XPS to studies of catalysis and how the insights gained from AP-XPS studies can be used to achieve fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanism at a molecular level.","787":"All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs) have drawn tremendous research interest in recent years. It is due to not only their tunable optical, electrochemical, and structural properties, but also many superior features that are not readily available in conventional polymer-fullerene solar cells (fullerene-PSCs) including long-term stability, synthetic accessibility, and excellent film-forming properties suitable for large-scale manufacturing. Recent breakthroughs in material design and device engineering have driven the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs exceeding 11%, which is comparable to the performance of fullerene-PSCs. Furthermore, outstanding mechanical durability and stretchability have been reported for all-PSCs, which make them stand out from the other small molecule-based PSCs as a promising power supplier for wearable electronic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the important work in all-PSCs, in which pertinent examples are deliberately chosen. First, we describe the key components that enabled the recent progresses of all-PSCs including rational design rules for efficient PDs and PAs, blend morphology control, and light harvesting engineering. We also review the recent work on the understanding of the stability of all-PSCs under various external conditions, which highlights the importance of all-PSCs for future implementation and commercialization. Finally, because all-PSCs have not yet achieved their full potential and are still undergoing rapid development, we offer our views on the current challenges and future prospects.","788":"This Review is devoted to the chemistry of macrocyclic peptides having heterocyclic fragments in their structure. These motifs are present in many natural products and synthetic macrocycles designed against a particular biochemical target. Thiazole and oxazole are particularly common constituents of naturally occurring macrocyclic peptide molecules. This frequency of occurrence is because the thiazole and oxazole rings originate from cysteine, serine, and threonine residues. Whereas other heteroaryl groups are found less frequently, they offer many insightful lessons that range from conformational control to receptor\/ligand interactions. Many options to develop new and improved technologies to prepare natural products have appeared in recent years, and the synthetic community has been pursuing synthetic macrocycles that have no precedent in nature. This Review attempts to summarize progress in this area.","789":"Many applications in chemistry, biology, and energy storage\/conversion research rely on molecular simulations to provide fundamental insight into structural and transport properties of materials with high ionic concentrations. Whether the system is comprised entirely of ions, like ionic liquids, or is a mixture of a polar solvent with a salt, e.g., liquid electrolytes for battery applications, the presence of ions in these materials results in strong local electric fields polarizing solvent molecules and large ions. To predict properties of such systems from molecular simulations often requires either explicit or mean-field inclusion of the influence of polarization on electrostatic interactions. In this manuscript, we review the pros and cons of different treatments of polarization ranging from the mean-field approaches to the most popular explicit polarization models in molecular dynamics simulations of ionic materials. For each method, we discuss their advantages and disadvantages and emphasize key assumptions as well as their adjustable parameters. Strategies for the development of polarizable models are presented with a specific focus on extracting atomic polarizabilities. Finally, we compare simulations using polarizable and nonpolarizable models for several classes of ionic systems, discussing the underlying physics that each approach includes or ignores, implications for implementation and computational efficiency, and the accuracy of properties predicted by these methods compared to experiments.","790":"Clusters have been the subject of intense investigations since their famous definition launched by Cotton in 1963, and the area has expanded ever since. One obvious development addresses the widening of the definition of what to call a cluster: from purely (transition) metal-metal linked assemblies, as per Cotton's early denomination, to nonmetal\/metal clusters or purely nonmetal cages, like fullerenes, and even noncovalent aggregates such as water clusters. The other extension concerns the broadened spectrum of compositions within the aforementioned cluster types and their corresponding structures that range from trinuclear motifs to clusters with sizes in the range of the hemoglobin unit. This review article reports on one cluster family that has its origins in traditional Zintl anion chemistry but has undergone rapid development in recent years, namely, ligand-free clusters that combine main group and transition metal atoms. Depending on the position of the transition metal atom(s), one refers to such clusters as intermetalloid (endohedral) clusters or as a special type of heterometallic clusters. The predominant synthetic access makes use of soluble Zintl anions. Other pathways for their preparation include traditional solid state reactions of according element combinations or bottom-up syntheses employing low valent organo-main group element sources. This survey will shed light on all of these approaches, with an emphasis on the syntheses that employ soluble Zintl anion compounds. The article will give a comprehensive overview of the currently known compounds, their different synthesis protocols, and analytic techniques for determination of their compositions, structures, and further properties. Additionally, this survey will report peculiarities of bonding situations found within some of the cluster molecules, which were studied by means of sophisticated quantum chemical investigations.","791":"The absorption of light by plasmonic nanostructures and their associated temperature increase are exquisitely sensitive to the shape and composition of the structure and to the wavelength of light. Therefore, much effort is put into synthesizing novel nanostructures for optimized interaction with the incident light. The successful synthesis and characterization of high quality and biocompatible plasmonic colloidal nanoparticles has fostered numerous and expanding applications, especially in biomedical contexts, where such particles are highly promising for general drug delivery and for tomorrow's cancer treatment. We review the thermoplasmonic properties of the most commonly used plasmonic nanoparticles, including solid or composite metallic nanoparticles of various dimensions and geometries. Common methods for synthesizing plasmonic particles are presented with the overall goal of providing the reader with a guide for designing or choosing nanostructures with optimal thermoplasmonic properties for a given application. Finally, the biocompatibility and biological tolerance of structures are critically discussed along with novel applications of plasmonic nanoparticles in the life sciences.","792":"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a powerful tool to address some of the most challenging issues in glass science and technology, such as the nonequilibrium nature of the glassy state and the detailed thermodynamics and kinetics of glass-forming systems during glass transition, relaxation, rejuvenation, polyamorphic transition, and crystallization. The utility of the DSC technique spans across all glass-forming chemistries, including oxide, chalcogenide, metallic, and organic systems, as well as recently discovered metal-organic framework glass-forming systems. Here we present a comprehensive review of the many applications of DSC in glass science with focus on glass transition, relaxation, polyamorphism, and crystallization phenomena. We also emphasize recent advances in DSC characterization technology, including flash DSC and temperature-modulated DSC. This review demonstrates how DSC studies have led to a multitude of relevant advances in the understanding of glass physics, chemistry, and even technology.","793":"To date, copper is the only heterogeneous catalyst that has shown a propensity to produce valuable hydrocarbons and alcohols, such as ethylene and ethanol, from electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R). There are variety of factors that impact CO2R activity and selectivity, including the catalyst surface structure, morphology, composition, the choice of electrolyte ions and pH, and the electrochemical cell design. Many of these factors are often intertwined, which can complicate catalyst discovery and design efforts. Here we take a broad and historical view of these different aspects and their complex interplay in CO2R catalysis on Cu, with the purpose of providing new insights, critical evaluations, and guidance to the field with regard to research directions and best practices. First, we describe the various experimental probes and complementary theoretical methods that have been used to discern the mechanisms by which products are formed, and next we present our current understanding of the complex reaction networks for CO2R on Cu. We then analyze two key methods that have been used in attempts to alter the activity and selectivity of Cu: nanostructuring and the formation of bimetallic electrodes. Finally, we offer some perspectives on the future outlook for electrochemical CO2R.","794":"","795":"Approximately 75% of all disease-relevant human proteins, including those involved in intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs), are undruggable with the current drug modalities (i.e., small molecules and biologics). Macrocyclic peptides provide a potential solution to these undruggable targets because their larger sizes (relative to conventional small molecules) endow them the capability of binding to flat PPI interfaces with antibody-like affinity and specificity. Powerful combinatorial library technologies have been developed to routinely identify cyclic peptides as potent, specific inhibitors against proteins including PPI targets. However, with the exception of a very small set of sequences, the vast majority of cyclic peptides are impermeable to the cell membrane, preventing their application against intracellular targets. This Review examines common structural features that render most cyclic peptides membrane impermeable, as well as the unique features that allow the minority of sequences to enter the cell interior by passive diffusion, endocytosis\/endosomal escape, or other mechanisms. We also present the current state of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of cell penetration, the various strategies for designing cell-permeable, biologically active cyclic peptides against intracellular targets, and the assay methods available to quantify their cell-permeability.","796":"Cation and anion recognition have both played central roles in the development of supramolecular chemistry. Much of the associated research has focused on the development of receptors for individual cations or anions, as well as their applications in different areas. Rarely is complexation of the counterions considered. In contrast, ion pair recognition chemistry, emerging from cation and anion coordination chemistry, is a specific research field where co-complexation of both anions and cations, so-called ion pairs, is the center of focus. Systems used for the purpose, known as ion pair receptors, are typically di- or polytopic hosts that contain recognition sites for both cations and anions and which permit the concurrent binding of multiple ions. The field of ion pair recognition has blossomed during the past decades. Several smaller reviews on the topic were published roughly 5 years ago. They provided a summary of synthetic progress and detailed the various limiting ion recognition modes displayed by both acyclic and macrocyclic ion pair receptors known at the time. The present review is designed to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the chemistry of macrocycle-based ion pair receptors. We specifically focus on the relationship between structure and ion pair recognition, as well as applications of ion pair receptors in sensor development, cation and anion extraction, ion transport, and logic gate construction.","797":"Photo-\/electrochemical catalyzed oxidative R1-H\/R2-H cross-coupling with hydrogen evolution has become an increasingly important issue for molecular synthesis. The dream of construction of C-C\/C-X bonds from readily available C-H\/X-H with release of H2 can be facilely achieved without external chemical oxidants, providing a greener model for chemical bond formation. Given the great influence of these reactions in organic chemistry, we give a summary of the state of the art in oxidative R1-H\/R2-H cross-coupling with hydrogen evolution via photo\/electrochemistry, and we hope this review will stimulate the development of a greener synthetic strategy in the near future.","798":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a megatrend that cuts across all scientific and engineering disciplines and establishes an integrating technical evolution to improve production efficiencies and daily human life. Linked machines and sensors use decision-making routines to work toward a common product or solution. Expanding this technical revolution into the value chain of complex areas such as agriculture, food production, and healthcare requires the implementation and connection of sophisticated (bio)analytical methods. Today, wearable sensors, monitors, and point-of-care diagnostic tests are part of our daily lives and improve patients' medical progression or athletes' monitoring capabilities that are already beyond imagination. Also, early contributions toward sensor networks and finally the IT revolution with wireless data collection and transmission via Bluetooth or smartphones have set the foundation to connect remote sensors and distributed analytical chemical services with centralized laboratories, cloud storage, and cloud computing. Here, we critically review those biosensor and chemosensor technologies and concepts used in an IoT setting or considered IoT-ready that were published in the period 2013-2018, while also pointing to those foundational concepts and ideas that arose over the last two decades. We focus on these sensors due to their unique ability to be remotely stationed and that easily function in networks and have made the greatest progress toward IoT integration. Finally, we highlight requirements and existing and future challenges and provide possible solutions important toward the vision of a seamless integration into a global analytical concept, which includes many more analytical techniques than sensors and includes foremost next-generation sequencing and separation principles coupled with MS detection.","799":"Until recently, computational tools were mainly used to explain chemical reactions after experimental results were obtained. With the rapid development of software and hardware technologies to make computational modeling tools more reliable, they can now provide valuable insights and even become predictive. In this review, we highlighted several studies involving computational predictions of unexpected reactivities or providing mechanistic insights for organic and organometallic reactions that led to improved experimental results. Key to these successful applications is an integration between theory and experiment that allows for incorporation of empirical knowledge with precise computed values. Computer modeling of chemical reactions is already a standard tool that is being embraced by an ever increasing group of researchers, and it is clear that its utility in predictive reaction design will increase further in the near future.","800":"","801":"Organometallic complexes: these two words jump to the mind of the chemist and are directly associated with their utility in catalysis or as a pharmaceutical. Nevertheless, to be able to use them, it is necessary to synthesize them, and it is not always a small matter. Typically, synthesis is via solution chemistry, using a round-bottom flask and a magnetic or mechanical stirrer. This review takes stock of alternative technologies currently available in laboratories that facilitate the synthesis of such complexes. We highlight five such technologies: mechanochemistry, also known as solvent-free chemistry, uses a mortar and pestle or a ball mill; microwave activation can drastically reduce reaction times; ultrasonic activation promotes chemical reactions because of cavitation phenomena; photochemistry, which uses light radiation to initiate reactions; and continuous flow chemistry, which is increasingly used to simplify scale-up. While facilitating the synthesis of organometallic compounds, these enabling technologies also allow access to compounds that cannot be obtained in any other way. This shows how the paradigm is changing and evolving toward new technologies, without necessarily abandoning the round-bottom flask. A bright future is ahead of the organometallic chemist, thanks to these novel technologies.","802":"Nanoparticle (NP) high pressure behavior has been extensively studied over the years. In this review, we summarize recent progress on the studies of pressure induced NP phase behavior, property, and applications. This review starts with a brief overview of high pressure characterization techniques, coupled with synchrotron X-ray scattering, Raman, fluorescence, and absorption. Then, we survey the pressure induced phase transition of NP atomic crystal structure including size dependent phase transition, amorphization, and threshold pressures using several typical NP material systems as examples. Next, we discuss the pressure induced phase transition of NP mesoscale structures including topics on pressure induced interparticle separation distance, NP coupling, and NP coalescence. Pressure induced new properties and applications in different NP systems are highlighted. Finally, outlooks with future directions are discussed.","803":"In silico catalyst design is a grand challenge of chemistry. Traditional computational approaches have been limited by the need to compute properties for an intractably large number of possible catalysts. Recently, inverse design methods have emerged, starting from a desired property and optimizing a corresponding chemical structure. Techniques used for exploring chemical space include gradient-based optimization, alchemical transformations, and machine learning. Though the application of these methods to catalysis is in its early stages, further development will allow for robust computational catalyst design. This review provides an overview of the evolution of inverse design approaches and their relevance to catalysis. The strengths and limitations of existing techniques are highlighted, and suggestions for future research are provided.","804":"Innovative synthetic coordination and, increasingly, organometallic chemistry are at the heart of advances in molecular magnetism. Smart ligand design is essential for implementing controlled modifications to the electronic structure and magnetic properties of transition metal and f-element compounds, and many important recent developments use nontraditional ligands based on low-coordinate main group elements to drive the field forward. This review charts progress in molecular magnetism from the perspective of ligands in which the donor atoms range from low-coordinate 2p elements-particularly carbon but also boron and nitrogen-to the heavier p-block elements such as phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and even bismuth. Emphasis is placed on the role played by novel main group ligands in addressing magnetic anisotropy of transition metal and f-element compounds, which underpins the development of single-molecule magnets (SMMs), a family of magnetic materials that can retain magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field below a blocking temperature. Nontraditional p-block donor atoms, with their relatively diffuse valence orbitals and more diverse bonding characteristics, also introduce scope for tuning the spin-orbit coupling properties and metal-ligand covalency in molecular magnets, which has implications in areas such as magnetic exchange coupling and spin crossover phenomena. The chemistry encompasses transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides and describes recently discovered molecular magnets that can be regarded, currently, as defining the state of the art. This review identifies that main group chemistry at the interface molecular magnetism is an area with huge potential to deliver new types of molecular magnets with previously unseen properties and applications.","805":"","806":"The native chemical ligation reaction (NCL) involves reacting a C-terminal peptide thioester with an N-terminal cysteinyl peptide to produce a native peptide bond between the two fragments. This reaction has considerably extended the size of polypeptides and proteins that can be produced by total synthesis and has also numerous applications in bioconjugation, polymer synthesis, material science, and micro- and nanotechnology research. The aim of the present review is to provide a thorough mechanistic overview of NCL and extended methods. The most relevant properties of peptide thioesters, Cys peptides, and common solvents, reagents, additives, and catalysts used for these ligations are presented. Mechanisms, selectivity and reactivity are, whenever possible, discussed through the insights of computational and physical chemistry studies. The inherent limitations of NCL are discussed with insights from the mechanistic standpoint. This review also presents a palette of O, S-, N, S-, or N, Se-acyl shift systems as thioester or selenoester surrogates and discusses the special molecular features that govern reactivity in each case. Finally, the various thiol-based auxiliaries and thiol or selenol amino acid surrogates that have been developed so far are discussed with a special focus on the mechanism of long-range N, S-acyl migrations and selective dechalcogenation reactions.","807":"Cyclization is an important post-translational modification of peptides and proteins that confers key advantages such as protection from proteolytic degradation, altered solubility, membrane permeability, bioavailability, and especially restricted conformational freedom in water that allows the peptide backbone to adopt the major secondary structure elements found in proteins. Non-ribosomal synthesis in bacteria, fungi, and plants or synthetic chemistry can introduce unnatural amino acids and non-peptidic constraints that modify peptide backbones and side chains to fine-tune cyclic peptide structure. Structures can be potentially altered further upon binding to a protein in biological environments. Here we analyze three-dimensional crystal structures for 211 bioactive cyclic peptides bound to 65 different proteins. The protein-bound cyclic peptides were examined for similarities and differences in bonding modes, for main-chain and side-chain structure, and for the importance of polarity, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, and water molecules in interactions with proteins. Many protein-bound cyclic peptides show backbone structures like those (strands, sheets, turns, helices, loops, or distorted variations) found at protein-protein binding interfaces. However, the notion of macrocycles simply as privileged scaffolds that primarily project side-chain substituents for complementary interactions with proteins is dispelled here. Unlike small-molecule drugs, the cyclic peptides do not rely mainly upon hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions for protein binding; they also use their main chain and side chains to form polar contacts and hydrogen bonds with proteins. Compared to small-molecule ligands, cyclic peptides can bind across larger, polar, and water-exposed protein surface areas, making many more contacts that can increase affinity, selectivity, biological activity, and ligand-receptor residence time. Cyclic peptides have a greater capacity than small-molecule drugs to modulate protein-protein interfaces that involve large, shallow, dynamic, polar, and water-exposed protein surfaces.","808":null,"809":"Brillouin spectroscopy and imaging are emerging techniques in analytical science, biophotonics, and biomedicine. They are based on Brillouin light scattering from acoustic waves or phonons in the GHz range, providing a nondestructive contactless probe of the mechanics on a microscale. Novel approaches and applications of these techniques to the field of biomedical sciences are discussed, highlighting the theoretical foundations and experimental methods that have been developed to date. Acknowledging that this is a fast moving field, a comprehensive account of the relevant literature is critically assessed here.","810":"We begin with the history of aquaporin zero (AQP0), the most prevalent membrane protein in the eye lens, from the early days when AQP0 was a protein of unknown function known as Major Intrinsic Protein 26. We progress through its joining the aquaporin family as a water channel in its own right and discuss how regulation of its water permeability by pH and calcium came to be discovered experimentally and linked to lens homeostasis and development. We review the development of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid bilayers and membrane proteins, including aquaporins, with an emphasis on simulation studies that have elucidated the mechanisms of water conduction, selectivity, and proton exclusion by aquaporins in general. We also review experimental and theoretical progress toward understanding why mammalian AQP0 has a lower water permeability than other aquaporins and the evolution of our present understanding of how its water permeability is regulated by pH and calcium. Finally, we discuss how MD simulations have elucidated the nature of lipid interactions with AQP0.","811":"Next-generation displays and lighting technologies require efficient optical sources that combine brightness, color purity, stability, substrate flexibility. Metal halide perovskites have potential use in a wide range of applications, for they possess excellent charge transport, bandgap tunability and, in the most promising recent optical source materials, intense and efficient luminescence. This review links metal halide perovskites' performance as efficient light emitters with their underlying materials electronic and photophysical attributes.","812":"Palladium\/norbornene cooperative catalysis has emerged as a distinct approach to construct polyfunctionalized arenes from readily available starting materials. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of this field, including the early stoichiometric investigations, catalytic reaction developments, as well as the applications in the syntheses of bioactive compounds and polymers. The section of catalytic reactions is divided into two parts according to the reaction initiation mode: Pd(0)-initiated reactions and Pd(II)-initiated reactions.","813":"Membranes surrounding the biological cell and its internal compartments host proteins that catalyze chemical reactions essential for the functioning of the cell. Rather than being a passive structural matrix that holds membrane-embedded proteins in place, the membrane can largely shape the conformational energy landscape of membrane proteins and impact the energetics of their chemical reaction. Here, we highlight the challenges in understanding how lipids impact the conformational energy landscape of macromolecular membrane complexes whose functioning involves chemical reactions including proton transfer. We review here advances in our understanding of how chemical reactions occur at membrane interfaces gleaned with both theoretical and experimental advances using simple protein systems as guides. Our perspective is that of bridging experiments with theory to understand general physicochemical principles of membrane reactions, with a long term goal of furthering our understanding of the role of the lipids on the functioning of complex macromolecular assemblies at the membrane interface.","814":"Allosteric signaling in biological molecules, which may be viewed as specific action at a distance due to localized perturbation upon binding of ligands or changes in environmental cues, is pervasive in biology. Insightful phenomenological Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC) and Koshland, Nemethy, and Filmer (KNF) models galvanized research in describing allosteric transitions for over five decades, and these models continue to be the basis for describing the mechanisms of allostery in a bewildering array of systems. However, understanding allosteric signaling and the associated dynamics between distinct allosteric states at the molecular level is challenging and requires novel experiments complemented by computational studies. In this review, we first describe symmetry and rigidity as essential requirements for allosteric proteins or multisubunit structures. The general features, with MWC and KNF as two extreme scenarios, emerge when allosteric signaling is viewed from an energy landscape perspective. To go beyond the general theories, we describe computational tools that are either based solely on multiple sequences or their structures to predict the allostery wiring diagram. These methods could be used to predict the network of residues that carry allosteric signals. Methods to obtain molecular insights into the dynamics of allosteric transitions are briefly mentioned. The utility of the methods is illustrated by applications to systems ranging from monomeric proteins in which there is little conformational change in the transition between two allosteric states to membrane bound G-protein coupled receptors and multisubunit proteins. Finally, the role allostery plays in the functions of ATP-consuming molecular machines, bacterial chaperonin GroEL and molecular motors, is described. Although universal molecular principles governing allosteric signaling do not exist, we can draw the following general conclusions from a survey of different systems. (1) Multiple pathways connecting allosteric states are highly heterogeneous. (2) Allosteric signaling is exquisitely sensitive to the specific architecture of the system, which implies that the capacity for allostery is encoded in the structure itself. (3) The mechanical modes that connect distinct allosteric states are robust to sequence variations. (4) Extensive investigations of allostery in Hemoglobin and, more recently GroEL, show that to a large extent a network of salt bridge rearrangements serves as allosteric switches. In both these examples the dynamical changes in the allosteric switches are related to function.","815":"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are a next-generation photovoltaic technology, whose natural transparency and good photovoltaic output under ambient light conditions afford them niche applications in solar-powered windows and interior design for energy-sustainable buildings. Their ability to be fabricated on flexible substrates, or as fibers, also makes them attractive as passive energy harvesters in wearable devices and textiles. Cosensitization has emerged as a method that affords efficiency gains in DSCs, being most celebrated via its role in nudging power conversion efficiencies of DSCs to reach world-record values; yet, cosensitization has a much wider potential for applications, as this review will show. Cosensitization is a chemical fabrication method that produces DSC working electrodes that contain two or more different dyes with complementary optical absorption characteristics. Dye combinations that collectively afford a panchromatic absorption spectrum emulating that of the solar emission spectrum are ideal, given that such combinations use all available sunlight. This review classifies existing cosensitization efforts into seven distinct ways that dyes have been combined in order to generate panchromatic DSCs. Seven cognate molecular-engineering strategies for cosensitization are thereby developed, which tailor optical absorption toward optimal DSC-device function.","816":"Nanowires are filamentary crystals with a tailored diameter that can be obtained using a plethora of different synthesis techniques. In this review, we focus on the vapor phase, highlighting the most influential achievements along with a historical perspective. Starting with the discovery of VLS, we feature the variety of structures and materials that can be synthesized in the nanowire form. We then move on to establish distinct features such as the three-dimensional heterostructure\/doping design and polytypism. We summarize the status quo of the growth mechanisms, recently confirmed by in situ electron microscopy experiments and defining common ground between the different synthesis techniques. We then propose a selection of remaining defects, starting from what we know and going toward what is still to be learned. We believe this review will serve as a reference for neophytes but also as an insight for experts in an effort to bring open questions under a new light.","817":"Biological systems have evolved biochemical, electrical, mechanical, and genetic networks to perform essential functions across various length and time scales. High-aspect-ratio biological nanowires, such as bacterial pili and neurites, mediate many of the interactions and homeostasis in and between these networks. Synthetic materials designed to mimic the structure of biological nanowires could also incorporate similar functional properties, and exploiting this structure-function relationship has already proved fruitful in designing biointerfaces. Semiconductor nanowires are a particularly promising class of synthetic nanowires for biointerfaces, given (1) their unique optical and electronic properties and (2) their high degree of synthetic control and versatility. These characteristics enable fabrication of a variety of electronic and photonic nanowire devices, allowing for the formation of well-defined, functional bioelectric interfaces at the biomolecular level to the whole-organ level. In this Focus Review, we first discuss the history of bioelectric interfaces with semiconductor nanowires. We next highlight several important, endogenous biological nanowires and use these as a framework to categorize semiconductor nanowire-based biointerfaces. Within this framework we then review the fundamentals of bioelectric interfaces with semiconductor nanowires and comment on both material choice and device design to form biointerfaces spanning multiple length scales. We conclude with a discussion of areas with the potential for greatest impact using semiconductor nanowire-enabled biointerfaces in the future.","818":"","819":null,"820":"In the past decade, multicomponent reactions have experienced a renaissance as powerful peptide macrocyclization tools enabling the rapid creation of skeletal complexity and diversity with low synthetic cost. This review provides both a historical and modern overview of the development of the peptide multicomponent macrocyclization as a strategy capable to compete with the classic peptide cyclization methods in terms of chemical efficiency and synthetic scope. We prove that the utilization of multicomponent reactions for cyclizing peptides by either their termini or side chains provides a key advantage over those more established methods; that is, the possibility to explore the cyclic peptide chemotype space not only at the amino acid sequence but also at the ring-forming moiety. Owing to its multicomponent nature, this type of peptide cyclization process is well-suited to generate diversity at both the endo- and exo-cyclic fragments formed during the ring-closing step, which stands as a distinctive and useful characteristic for the creation and screening of cyclic peptide libraries. Examples of the novel multicomponent peptide stapling approach and heterocycle ring-forming macrocyclizations are included, along with multicomponent methods incorporating macrocyclization handles and the one-pot syntheses of macromulticyclic peptide cages. Interesting applications of this strategy in the field of drug discovery and chemical biology are provided.","821":null,"822":"The cellular membrane constitutes one of the most fundamental compartments of a living cell, where key processes such as selective transport of material and exchange of information between the cell and its environment are mediated by proteins that are closely associated with the membrane. The heterogeneity of lipid composition of biological membranes and the effect of lipid molecules on the structure, dynamics, and function of membrane proteins are now widely recognized. Characterization of these functionally important lipid-protein interactions with experimental techniques is however still prohibitively challenging. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a powerful complementary approach with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions to gain atomic-level structural information and energetics on lipid-protein interactions. In this review, we aim to provide a broad survey of MD simulations focusing on exploring lipid-protein interactions and characterizing lipid-modulated protein structure and dynamics that have been successful in providing novel insight into the mechanism of membrane protein function.","823":"Amyloids, fibrillar assembly of (poly)peptide chains, are associated with neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for which there are no cures. The molecular mechanisms of the formation of toxic species are still elusive. Some peptides and proteins can form functional amyloid-like aggregates mainly in bacteria and fungi but also in humans. Little is known on the differences in self-assembly mechanisms of functional and pathogenic (poly)peptides. We review atomistic and coarse-grained simulation studies of amyloid peptides in their monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar states. Particular emphasis is given to the challenges one faces to characterize at atomic level of detail the conformational space of disordered (poly)peptides and their aggregation. We discuss the difficulties in comparing simulation results and experimental data, and we propose new simulation studies to shed light on the aggregation processes associated with amyloid diseases.","824":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an essential role in regulating various physiological functions of living organisms. The intrinsic biochemical properties of ROS, which underlie the mechanisms necessary for the growth, fitness, or aging of living organisms, have been driving researchers to take full advantage of these active chemical species for contributing to medical advances. Thanks to the remarkable advances in nanotechnology, great varieties of nanomaterials with unique ROS-regulating properties have been explored to guide the temporospatial dynamic behaviors of ROS in biological milieu, which contributes to the emergence of a new-generation therapeutic methodology, i.e., nanomaterial-guided in vivo ROS evolution for therapy. The interdependent relationship between ROS and their corresponding chemistry, biology, and nanotherapy leads us to propose the concept of \"ROS science\", which is believed to be an emerging scientific discipline that studies the chemical mechanisms, biological effects, and nanotherapeutic applications of ROS. In this review, state-of-art studies concerning recent progresses on ROS-based nanotherapies have been summarized in detail, with an emphasis on underlying material chemistry of nanomaterials by which ROS are generated or scavenged for improved therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, key scientific issues in the evolution of ROS-based cross-disciplinary fields have also been discussed, aiming to unlock the innate powers of ROS for optimized therapeutic efficacies. We expect that our demonstration on this evolving field will be beneficial to the further development of ROS-based fundamental researches and clinical applications.","825":"Organocobalt(III) complexes (R-CoIII), defined as cobalt complexes featuring a carbon-cobalt bond, are largely used to produce carbon-centered radicals by homolytic cleavage of their C-Co bond under mild conditions. They are key compounds in cutting-edge developments in the fields of organic chemistry, biochemistry, medical research, radical reactions, and organometallic chemistry. This is the first Review of the use of R-CoIII in both organic and polymer chemistries. Although pioneering works in organic synthesis have largely contributed to the implementation of R-CoIII in polymer design, the two fields have evolved independently, with many breakthroughs on both sides. The main motivation of this Review is to confront both fields to stimulate cross-fertilization. It notably describes the most important synthetic pathways for R-CoIII, the influence of the ligand structure and the environment of the complex on the C-Co bond strength, the modes of formation of the radicals, and the most relevant R-CoIII-promoted radical reactions, with a focus on the main reaction mechanisms.","826":"Tetrahydroquinoline is one of the most important simple nitrogen heterocycles, being widespread in nature and present in a broad variety of pharmacologically active compounds. This Review summarizes the progress achieved in the chemistry of tetrahydroquinolines, with emphasis on their synthesis, during the period from mid-2010 to early 2018.","827":"Spontaneous solute and solvent permeation through membranes is of vital importance to human life, be it gas exchange in red blood cells, metabolite excretion, drug\/toxin uptake, or water homeostasis. Knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is the sine qua non of every functional assignment to membrane transporters. The basis of our current solubility diffusion model was laid by Meyer and Overton. It correlates the solubility of a substance in an organic phase with its membrane permeability. Since then, a wide range of studies challenging this rule have appeared. Commonly, the discrepancies have their origin in ill-used measurement approaches, as we demonstrate on the example of membrane CO2 transport. On the basis of the insight that scanning electrochemical microscopy offered into solute concentration distributions in immediate membrane vicinity of planar membranes, we analyzed the interplay between chemical reactions and diffusion for solvent transport, weak acid permeation, and enzymatic reactions adjacent to membranes. We conclude that buffer reactions must also be considered in spectroscopic investigations of weak acid transport in vesicular suspensions. The evaluation of energetic contributions to membrane translocation of charged species demonstrates the compatibility of the resulting membrane current with the solubility diffusion model. A local partition coefficient that depends on membrane penetration depth governs spontaneous membrane translocation of both charged and uncharged molecules. It is determined not only by the solubility in an organic phase but also by other factors like cholesterol concentration and intrinsic electric membrane potentials.","828":null,"829":"Macrocyclic natural products have been recognized and utilized as new platforms for designing drugs in pharmaceutical research because the constrained three-dimensional shapes and the large surface areas of these complex structures enable selective binding to conventionally undruggable targets. Since natural products are not necessarily ideal for medicinal use, structural optimization is required to obtain superior drug candidates. However, the modifications to macrocyclic natural products that will afford the best pharmacological characteristics cannot be known a priori. Therefore, this optimization procedure requires the exploration of a vast array of natural product analogues to identify new compounds with more desirable properties. To fully explore the chemical space around complex macrocyclic natural products, the construction of a large number of analogues is required. In this review, we provide an overview of the efficient synthetic construction of the analogues of macrocyclic natural products and the evaluation of their biological activities. The examples of the comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies depicted herein led to the discoveries of biologically useful analogues. These studies illustrate the importance of designing building blocks and coupling strategies to synthesize a variety of natural product based analogues.","830":"This Review discusses the structure-property relationships in chiral molecules, macromolecules (polymers), and supramolecules (crystals, liquid crystals, or thin films) containing main-group elements. Chirality is a major property in our world, having a prominent influence on processes in biology, chemistry, and physics. Its impact in optics due to its interaction with electromagnetic waves gave rise to a multitude of effects, such as the Cotton effect and circularly polarized luminescence, making possible applications such as 3D displays and polarized sunglasses. Herein, a particular emphasis will be given to the influence of chirality on the conducting and optical properties of molecules or materials containing frontier heteroelements, particularly boron, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur. These synergic materials are expected to become game-changers in the field of materials science by bringing new properties into the realm of reality, such as chirality-induced spin-selectivity, circularly polarized luminescence, and electrical magnetochiral anisotropy. This Review should be of interest for chemists and also physicists working in the fields of molecular and supramolecular chemistry, and molecular materials in the broadest sense.","831":"N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become one of the most widely studied class of ligands in molecular chemistry and have found applications in fields as varied as catalysis, the stabilization of reactive molecular fragments, and biochemistry. More recently, NHCs have found applications in materials chemistry and have allowed for the functionalization of surfaces, polymers, nanoparticles, and discrete, well-defined clusters. In this review, we provide an in-depth look at recent advances in the use of NHCs for the development of functional materials.","832":"","833":"The design of nanoparticles is critical for their efficient use in many applications ranging from biomedicine to sensing and energy. While shape and size are responsible for the properties of the inorganic nanoparticle core, the choice of ligands is of utmost importance for the colloidal stability and function of the nanoparticles. Moreover, the selection of ligands employed in nanoparticle synthesis can determine their final size and shape. Ligands added after nanoparticle synthesis infer both new properties as well as provide enhanced colloidal stability. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on the role of the ligands with respect to the nanoparticle morphology, stability, and function. We analyze the interaction of nanoparticle surface and ligands with different chemical groups, the types of bonding, the final dispersibility of ligand-coated nanoparticles in complex media, their reactivity, and their performance in biomedicine, photodetectors, photovoltaic devices, light-emitting devices, sensors, memory devices, thermoelectric applications, and catalysis.","834":"Electrospinning is a versatile and viable technique for generating ultrathin fibers. Remarkable progress has been made with regard to the development of electrospinning methods and engineering of electrospun nanofibers to suit or enable various applications. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of electrospinning, including the principle, methods, materials, and applications. We begin with a brief introduction to the early history of electrospinning, followed by discussion of its principle and typical apparatus. We then discuss its renaissance over the past two decades as a powerful technology for the production of nanofibers with diversified compositions, structures, and properties. Afterward, we discuss the applications of electrospun nanofibers, including their use as \"smart\" mats, filtration membranes, catalytic supports, energy harvesting\/conversion\/storage components, and photonic and electronic devices, as well as biomedical scaffolds. We highlight the most relevant and recent advances related to the applications of electrospun nanofibers by focusing on the most representative examples. We also offer perspectives on the challenges, opportunities, and new directions for future development. At the end, we discuss approaches to the scale-up production of electrospun nanofibers and briefly discuss various types of commercial products based on electrospun nanofibers that have found widespread use in our everyday life.","835":"","836":"pH-sensing materials and configurations are rapidly evolving toward exciting new applications, especially those in biomedical applications. In this review, we highlight rapid progress in electrochemical pH sensors over the past decade (2008-2018) with an emphasis on key considerations, such as materials selection, system configurations, and testing protocols. In addition to recent progress in optical pH sensors, our main focus in this review is on electromechanical pH sensors due to their significant advances, especially in biomedical applications. We summarize developments of electrochemical pH sensors that by virtue of their optimized material chemistries (from metal oxides to polymers) and geometrical features (from thin films to quantum dots) enable their adoption in biomedical applications. We further present an overview of necessary sensing standards and protocols. Standards ensure the establishment of consistent protocols, facilitating collective understanding of results and building on the current state. Furthermore, they enable objective benchmarking of various pH-sensing reports, materials, and systems, which is critical for the overall progression and development of the field. Additionally, we list critical issues in recent literary reporting and suggest various methods for objective benchmarking. pH regulation in the human body and state-of-the-art pH sensors (from ex vivo to in vivo) are compared for suitability in biomedical applications. We conclude our review by (i) identifying challenges that need to be overcome in electrochemical pH sensing and (ii) providing an outlook on future research along with insights, in which the integration of various pH sensors with advanced electronics can provide a new platform for the development of novel technologies for disease diagnostics and prevention.","837":"Improving the knowledge of the relationship between structure and properties is fundamental in catalysis. Recently, researchers have developed a variety of well-controlled methods to synthesize atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs). NCs have shown high catalytic activity and unique selectivity in many catalytic reactions, which are related to their ultrasmall size, abundant unsaturated active sites, and unique electronic structure different from that of traditional nanoparticles (NPs). More importantly, because of their definite structure and monodispersity, they are used as model catalysts to reveal the correlation between catalyst performance and structure at the atomic scale. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the recent progress on NCs in catalysis and provide potential theoretical guidance for the rational design of high-performance catalysts. First a brief summary of the synthetic strategies and characterization methods of NCs is provided. Then the primary focus of this review-the model catalyst role of NCs in catalysis-is illustrated from theoretical and experimental perspectives, particularly in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, photoelectric conversion, and catalysis of organic reactions. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities are examined for a deep understanding of the key catalytic steps with the goal of expanding the catalytic application range of NCs.","838":"The generation and handling of the light-sensitive and metastable yellow arsenic (As4) is extremely challenging. In view of recent breakthroughs in synthesizing As4 storage materials and transfer reagents, the more intensive use of yellow arsenic as a source for further reactions can be expected. Given these aspects, the current stage of knowledge of the direct use of As4 is comprehensively summarized in the present review, which lists the activation of As4 by main group elements as well as transition metal compounds (including the f-block elements). Moreover, it also partly compares the reaction outcomes in relation to the corresponding reactions of P4. The possibility of using alternative sources for generating arsenic moieties and compounds is also discussed. The release of As4 molecules from precursor compounds and the use of transfer reagents for polyarsenic entities open up new synthetic pathways to avoid the direct generation of yellow arsenic solutions and to ensure its smooth usage for subsequent reactions.","839":"The development of synthetic chemistry since the early 1900s owes much to the service of organolithium reagents. Brilliant bases (e.g., deprotonating C-H bonds), nucleophiles (e.g., adding to unsaturated molecules), and transfer agents (e.g., delivering ligands to other metals), these versatile virtuosi and to a lesser extent the organic derivatives of the other common alkali metals sodium and potassium have proved indispensable in both academia and technology. Today these monometallic compounds are still utilized widely in synthetic campaigns, but in recent years they have been joined by an assortment of bimetallic formulations that also contain an alkali metal but in company with another metal. These bimetallic formulations often exhibit unique chemistry that can be interpreted in terms of synergistic effects, for which the alkali metal is essential, though it is often the second metal that performs the synthetic transformation. Here, this \"alkali-metal-mediated\" chemistry is surveyed focusing mainly on bimetallic formulations containing two alkali metals or an alkali metal paired with magnesium, calcium, zinc, aluminum, or gallium. In this International Year of the Periodic Table (IYPT), we ponder whether a Pairiodic Table of Element Pairs will emerge in the future.","840":"The field of thermoelectric research has undergone a renaissance and boom in the past two and a half decades, largely fueled by the prospect of engineering electronic and phononic properties in nanostructures, among which semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have served both as an important platform to investigate fundamental thermoelectric transport phenomena and as a promising route for high thermoelectric performance for diverse applications. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive look at various aspects of thermoelectrics of NWs. We start with a brief introduction of basic thermoelectric phenomena, followed by synthetic methods for thermoelectric NWs and a summary of their thermoelectric figures of merit (ZT). We then focus our discussion on charge and heat transport, which dictate thermoelectric power factor and thermal conductivity, respectively. For charge transport, we cover the basic principles governing the power factor and then review several strategies using NWs to enhance it, including earlier theoretical and experimental work on quantum confinement effects and semimetal-to-semiconductor transition, surface engineering and complex heterostructures to enhance the carrier mobility and power factor, and the recent emergence of topological insulator NWs. For phonon transport, we broadly categorize the work on thermal conductivity of NWs into five different effects: classic size effect, acoustic softening, surface roughness, complex NW morphology, and dimensional crossover. Finally, we discuss the integration of NWs for device applications for thermoelectric power generation and cooling. We conclude our review with some outlooks for future research.","841":"Nitrones are important compounds and are highly useful in many aspects. The first part describes the methods for synthesis of nitrones, which are useful and environmentally friendly. Catalytic oxidations, condensations, and other useful reactions are described. The nitrones thus obtained are key intermediates for the synthesis of biologically important nitrogen compounds. The second part describes the fundamental transformations of nitrones, which will provide the strategies and means for the construction of nitrogen compounds. The reactions with nucleophiles or radicals, C-H functionalization, and various addition reactions are described. The last reactions are particularly important for highly selective carbon-carbon bond formations. 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition reactions are excluded because the size of the review is limited and excellent reviews have been published in Chemical Reviews.","842":"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for solar-driven hydrogen production with zero emissions, and it has been intensively studied over the past decades. However, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies of the current PEC systems are still far from the 10% target needed for practical application. The development of efficient photoelectrodes in PEC systems holds the key to achieving high STH efficiencies. In recent years, crystal facet engineering has emerged as an important strategy in designing efficient photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting, which has yet to be comprehensively reviewed and is the main focus of this article. After the Introduction, the second section of this review concisely introduces the mechanisms of crystal facet engineering. The subsequent section provides a snapshot of the unique facet-dependent properties of some semiconductor crystals including surface electronic structures, redox reaction sites, surface built-in electric fields, molecular adsorption, photoreaction activity, photocorrosion resistance, and electrical conductivity. Then, the methods for fabricating photoelectrodes with faceted semiconductor crystals are reviewed, with a focus on the preparation processes. In addition, the notable advantages of the crystal facet engineering of photoelectrodes in terms of light harvesting, charge separation and transfer, and surface reactions are critically discussed. This is followed by a systematic overview of the modification strategies of faceted photoelectrodes to further enhance the PEC performance. The last section summarizes the major challenges and some invigorating perspectives for future research on crystal facet engineered photoelectrodes, which are believed to play a vital role in promoting the development of this important research field.","843":"On-surface synthesis is appearing as an extremely promising research field aimed at creating new organic materials. A large number of chemical reactions have been successfully demonstrated to take place directly on surfaces through unusual reaction mechanisms. In some cases the reaction conditions can be properly tuned to steer the formation of the reaction products. It is thus possible to control the initiation step of the reaction and its degree of advancement (the kinetics, the reaction yield); the nature of the reaction products (selectivity control, particularly in the case of competing processes); as well as the structure, position, and orientation of the covalent compounds, or the quality of the as-formed networks in terms of order and extension. The aim of our review is thus to provide an extensive description of all tools and strategies reported to date and to put them into perspective. We specifically define the different approaches available and group them into a few general categories. In the last part, we demonstrate the effective maturation of the on-surface synthesis field by reporting systems that are getting closer to application-relevant levels thanks to the use of advanced control strategies.","844":"Among renewable energies, wind and solar are inherently intermittent and therefore both require efficient energy storage systems to facilitate a round-the-clock electricity production at a global scale. In this context, concentrated solar power (CSP) stands out among other sustainable technologies because it offers the interesting possibility of storing energy collected from the sun as heat by sensible, latent, or thermochemical means. Accordingly, continuous electricity generation in the power block is possible even during off-sun periods, providing CSP plants with a remarkable dispatchability. Sensible heat storage has been already incorporated to commercial CSP plants. However, because of its potentially higher energy storage density, thermochemical heat storage (TCS) systems emerge as an attractive alternative for the design of next-generation power plants, which are expected to operate at higher temperatures. Through these systems, thermal energy is used to drive endothermic chemical reactions, which can subsequently release the stored energy when needed through a reversible exothermic step. This review analyzes the status of this prominent energy storage technology, its major challenges, and future perspectives, covering in detail the numerous strategies proposed for the improvement of materials and thermochemical reactors. Thermodynamic calculations allow selecting high energy density systems, but experimental findings indicate that sufficiently rapid kinetics and long-term stability trough continuous cycles of chemical transformation are also necessary for practical implementation. In addition, selecting easy-to-handle materials with reduced cost and limited toxicity is crucial for large-scale deployment of this technology. In this work, the possible utilization of materials as diverse as metal hydrides, hydroxides, or carbonates for thermochemical storage is discussed. Furthermore, special attention is paid to the development of redox metal oxides, such as Co3O4\/CoO, Mn2O3\/Mn3O4, and perovskites of different compositions, as an auspicious new class of TCS materials due to the advantage of working with atmospheric air as reactant, avoiding the need of gas storage tanks. Current knowledge about the structural, morphological, and chemical modifications of these solids, either caused during redox transformations or induced wittingly as a way to improve their properties, is revised in detail. In addition, the design of new reactor concepts proposed for the most efficient use of TCS in concentrated solar facilities is also critically considered. Finally, strategies for the harmonic integration of these units in functioning solar power plants as well as the economic aspects are also briefly assessed.","845":"Biological and biochemical systems are manifestations of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The ability to design and engineer such networks may allow the construction of artificial systems that are as complex as those seen in biology, opening the way to translational possibilities including adaptive materials. One venue for progress is the design of autonomous systems capable of pattern generation; however many synthetic CRNs, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, cannot be rewired to encode more complex interactions and thus lack the capacity for more detailed engineering algorithms. In contrast, DNA is an information-rich molecule with predictable and reliable base-pairing interactions and well-studied kinetics, and the use of DNA has greatly enabled the rational design of much more complex synthetic CRNs. Recent advances in the DNA computing field include circuits for pattern transformation, an example of self-organization. An arsenal of tools for designing DNA circuits to implement various CRNs has been developed by DNA nanotechnologists, including software to reliably program strand-displacement nucleic acid circuits. In addition, DNA walkers can be used to create CRNs with controlled diffusivity, while DNA gels similarly represent a new medium for implementing CRNs that may ultimately lead to the development of smart materials. As we will argue, future endeavors in nucleic acid-based pattern generation will be most greatly advanced by harnessing well-known enzymatic processes to serve as generators and amplifiers. Once nucleic acid computing tools are further developed to expedite the design process of pattern generation, we anticipate a transition from proof-of-concept curiosities to application-driven inquiries.","846":"","847":null,"848":"Biological membranes are tricky to investigate. They are complex in terms of molecular composition and structure, functional over a wide range of time scales, and characterized by nonequilibrium conditions. Because of all of these features, simulations are a great technique to study biomembrane behavior. A significant part of the functional processes in biological membranes takes place at the molecular level; thus computer simulations are the method of choice to explore how their properties emerge from specific molecular features and how the interplay among the numerous molecules gives rise to function over spatial and time scales larger than the molecular ones. In this review, we focus on this broad theme. We discuss the current state-of-the-art of biomembrane simulations that, until now, have largely focused on a rather narrow picture of the complexity of the membranes. Given this, we also discuss the challenges that we should unravel in the foreseeable future. Numerous features such as the actin-cytoskeleton network, the glycocalyx network, and nonequilibrium transport under ATP-driven conditions have so far received very little attention; however, the potential of simulations to solve them would be exceptionally high. A major milestone for this research would be that one day we could say that computer simulations genuinely research biological membranes, not just lipid bilayers.","849":"This review addresses concepts, approaches, tools, and outcomes of multiscale modeling used to design and optimize the current and next generation rechargeable battery cells. Different kinds of multiscale models are discussed and demystified with a particular emphasis on methodological aspects.

Finally, the main challenges remaining and future developments are discussed.","850":"This Review offers a comprehensive review of the colloidal synthesis, mechanistic understanding, physicochemical properties, and applications of one-dimensional (1D) metal nanostructures. After a brief introduction to the different types of 1D nanostructures, we discuss major concepts and methods typically involved in a colloidal synthesis of 1D metal nanostructures, as well as the current mechanistic understanding of how the nanostructures are formed. We then highlight how experimental studies and computational simulations have expanded our knowledge of how and why 1D metal nanostructures grow. Following specific examples of syntheses for monometallic, multimetallic, and heterostructured systems, we showcase how the unique structure-property relationships of 1D metal nanostructures have enabled a broad spectrum of applications, including sensing, imaging, plasmonics, photonics, display, thermal management, and catalysis. Throughout our discussion, we also offer perspectives with regard to the future directions of development for this class of nanomaterials.","851":"Halide photoredox chemistry is of both practical and fundamental interest. Practical applications have largely focused on solar energy conversion with hydrogen gas, through HX splitting, and electrical power generation, in regenerative photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic cells. On a more fundamental level, halide photoredox chemistry provides a unique means to generate and characterize one electron transfer chemistry that is intimately coupled with X-X bond-breaking and -forming reactivity. This review aims to deliver a background on the solution chemistry of I, Br, and Cl that enables readers to understand and utilize the most recent advances in halide photoredox chemistry research. These include reactions initiated through outer-sphere, halide-to-metal, and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer excited states. Kosower's salt, 1-methylpyridinium iodide, provides an early outer-sphere charge-transfer excited state that reports on solvent polarity. A plethora of new inner-sphere complexes based on transition and main group metal halide complexes that show promise for HX splitting are described. Long-lived charge-transfer excited states that undergo redox reactions with one or more halogen species are detailed. The review concludes with some key goals for future research that promise to direct the field of halide photoredox chemistry to even greater heights.","852":"The emergence of N-heterocyclic carbenes as ligands across the Periodic Table had an impact on various aspects of the coordination, organometallic, and catalytic chemistry of the 3d metals, including Cu, Ni, and Co, both from the fundamental viewpoint but also in applications, including catalysis, photophysics, bioorganometallic chemistry, materials, etc. In this review, the emergence, development, and state of the art in these three areas are described in detail.","853":"Protein-catalyzed capture agents (PCCs) are synthetic and modular peptide-based affinity agents that are developed through the use of single-generation in situ click chemistry screens against large peptide libraries. In such screens, the target protein, or a synthetic epitope fragment of that protein, provides a template for selectively promoting the noncopper catalyzed azide-alkyne dipolar cycloaddition click reaction between either a library peptide and a known ligand or a library peptide and the synthetic epitope. The development of epitope-targeted PCCs was motivated by the desire to fully generalize pioneering work from the Sharpless and Finn groups in which in situ click screens were used to develop potent, divalent enzymatic inhibitors. In fact, a large degree of generality has now been achieved. Various PCCs have demonstrated utility for selective protein detection, as allosteric or direct inhibitors, as modulators of protein folding, and as tools for in vivo tumor imaging. We provide a historical context for PCCs and place them within the broader scope of biological and synthetic aptamers. The development of PCCs is presented as (i) Generation I PCCs, which are branched ligands engineered through an iterative, nonepitope-targeted process, and (ii) Generation II PCCs, which are typically developed from macrocyclic peptide libraries and are precisely epitope-targeted. We provide statistical comparisons of Generation II PCCs relative to monoclonal antibodies in which the protein target is the same. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future opportunities of PCCs.","854":"In the last few decades, pharmaceuticals, credited with saving millions of lives, have emerged as a new class of environmental contaminant. These compounds can have both chronic and acute harmful effects on natural flora and fauna. The presence of pharmaceutical contaminants in ground waters, surface waters (lakes, rivers, and streams), sea water, wastewater treatment plants (influents and effluents), soils, and sludges has been well doccumented. A range of methods including oxidation, photolysis, UV-degradation, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and adsorption has been used for their remediation from aqueous systems. Many methods have been commercially limited by toxic sludge generation, incomplete removal, high capital and operating costs, and the need for skilled operating and maintenance personnel. Adsorption technologies are a low-cost alternative, easily used in developing countries where there is a dearth of advanced technologies, skilled personnel, and available capital, and adsorption appears to be the most broadly feasible pharmaceutical removal method. Adsorption remediation methods are easily integrated with wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Herein, we have reviewed the literature (1990-2018) illustrating the rising environmental pharmaceutical contamination concerns as well as remediation efforts emphasizing adsorption.","855":"","856":"Design and modification of interfaces, always a critical issue for semiconductor devices, has become a primary tool to harness the full potential of halide perovskite (HaP)-based optoelectronics, including photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. In particular, the outstanding improvements in HaP solar cell performance and stability can be primarily ascribed to a careful choice of the interfacial layout in the layer stack. In this review, we describe the unique challenges and opportunities of these approaches (section 1). For this purpose, we first elucidate the basic physical and chemical properties of the exposed HaP thin film and crystal surfaces, including topics such as surface termination, surface reactivity, and electronic structure (section 2). This is followed by discussing experimental results on the energetic alignment processes at the interfaces between the HaP and transport and buffer layers. This section includes understandings reached as well as commonly proposed and applied models, especially the often-questionable validity of vacuum level alignment, the importance of interface dipoles, and band bending as the result of interface formation (section 3). We follow this by elaborating on the impact of the interface formation on device performance, considering effects such as chemical reactions and surface passivation on interface energetics and stability. On the basis of these concepts, we propose a roadmap for the next steps in interfacial design for HaP semiconductors (section 4), emphasizing the importance of achieving control over the interface energetics and chemistry (i.e., reactivity) to allow predictive power for tailored interface optimization.","857":"The photovoltaics of organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have shown rapid improvements in solar cell performance, surpassing the top efficiency of semiconductor compounds such as CdTe and CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) used in solar cells in just about a decade. Perovskite preparation via simple and inexpensive solution processes demonstrates the immense potential of this thin-film solar cell technology to become a low-cost alternative to the presently commercially available photovoltaic technologies. Significant developments in almost all aspects of perovskite solar cells and discoveries of some fascinating properties of such hybrid perovskites have been made recently. This Review describes the fundamentals, recent research progress, present status, and our views on future prospects of perovskite-based photovoltaics, with discussions focused on strategies to improve both intrinsic and extrinsic (environmental) stabilities of high-efficiency devices. Strategies and challenges regarding compositional engineering of the hybrid perovskite structure are discussed, including potentials for developing all-inorganic and lead-free perovskite materials. Looking at the latest cutting-edge research, the prospects for perovskite-based photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, including non-photovoltaic applications such as X-ray detectors and image sensing devices in industrialization, are described. In addition to the aforementioned major topics, we also review, as a background, our encounter with perovskite materials for the first solar cell application, which should inspire young researchers in chemistry and physics to identify and work on challenging interdisciplinary research problems through exchanges between academia and industry.","858":"Molecular water oxidation catalysis is a field that has experienced an impressive development over the past decade mainly fueled by the promise of generation of a sustainable carbon neutral fuel society, based on water splitting. Most of these advancements have been possible thanks to the detailed understanding of the reactions and intermediates involved in the catalytic cycles. Today's best molecular water oxidation catalysts reach turnover frequencies that are orders of magnitude higher than that of the natural oxygen evolving center in photosystem II. These catalysts are based on Ru complexes where at some stage, the first coordination sphere of the metal center becomes seven coordinated. The key for this achievement is largely based on the use of adaptative ligands that adjust their coordination mode depending on the structural and electronic demands of the metal center at different oxidation states accessed within the catalytic cycle. This Review covers the latest and most significant developments on Ru complexes that behave as powerful water oxidation catalysts and where at some stage the Ru metal attains coordination number 7. Further it provides a comprehensive and rational understanding of the different structural and electronic factors that govern the behavior of these catalysts.","859":"It is well known that urbanization and industrialization have resulted in the rapidly increasing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are a major contributor to the formation of secondary pollutants (e.g., tropospheric ozone, PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate), and secondary organic aerosols) and photochemical smog. The emission of these pollutants has led to a large decline in air quality in numerous regions around the world, which has ultimately led to concerns regarding their impact on human health and general well-being. Catalytic oxidation is regarded as one of the most promising strategies for VOC removal from industrial waste streams. This Review systematically documents the progresses and developments made in the understanding and design of heterogeneous catalysts for VOC oxidation over the past two decades. It addresses in detail how catalytic performance is often drastically affected by the pollutant sources and reaction conditions. It also highlights the primary routes for catalyst deactivation and discusses protocols for their subsequent reactivation. Kinetic models and proposed oxidation mechanisms for representative VOCs are also provided. Typical catalytic reactors and oxidizers for industrial VOC destruction are further discussed. We believe that this Review will provide a great foundation and reference point for future design and development in this field.","860":"","861":"Ligands, especially phosphines and carbenes, can play a key role in modifying and controlling homogeneous organometallic catalysts, and they often provide a convenient approach to fine-tuning the performance of known catalysts. The measurable outcomes of such catalyst modifications (yields, rates, selectivity) can be set into context by establishing their relationship to steric and electronic descriptors of ligand properties, and such models can guide the discovery, optimization, and design of catalysts. In this review we present a survey of calculated ligand descriptors, with a particular focus on homogeneous organometallic catalysis. A range of different approaches to calculating steric and electronic parameters are set out and compared, and we have collected descriptors for a range of representative ligand sets, including 30 monodentate phosphorus(III) donor ligands, 23 bidentate P,P-donor ligands, and 30 carbenes, with a view to providing a useful resource for analysis to practitioners. In addition, several case studies of applications of such descriptors, covering both maps and models, have been reviewed, illustrating how descriptor-led studies of catalysis can inform experiments and highlighting good practice for model comparison and evaluation.","862":"Because of the high catalytic activities and substrate specificity, natural enzymes have been widely used in industrial, medical, and biological fields, etc. Although promising, they often suffer from intrinsic shortcomings such as high cost, low operational stability, and difficulties of recycling. To overcome these shortcomings, researchers have been devoted to the exploration of artificial enzyme mimics for a long time. Since the discovery of ferromagnetic nanoparticles with intrinsic horseradish peroxidase-like activity in 2007, a large amount of studies on nanozymes have been constantly emerging in the next decade. Nanozymes are one kind of nanomaterials with enzymatic catalytic properties. Compared with natural enzymes, nanozymes have the advantages such as low cost, high stability and durability, which have been widely used in industrial, medical, and biological fields. A thorough understanding of the possible catalytic mechanisms will contribute to the development of novel and high-efficient nanozymes, and the rational regulations of the activities of nanozymes are of great significance. In this review, we systematically introduce the classification, catalytic mechanism, activity regulation as well as recent research progress of nanozymes in the field of biosensing, environmental protection, and disease treatments, etc. in the past years. We also propose the current challenges of nanozymes as well as their future research focus. We anticipate this review may be of significance for the field to understand the properties of nanozymes and the development of novel nanomaterials with enzyme mimicking activities.","863":"Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM) are formed in the atmosphere via autoxidation involving peroxy radicals arising from volatile organic compounds (VOC). HOM condense on pre-existing particles and can be involved in new particle formation. HOM thus contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a significant and ubiquitous component of atmospheric aerosol known to affect the Earth's radiation balance. HOM were discovered only very recently, but the interest in these compounds has grown rapidly. In this Review, we define HOM and describe the currently available techniques for their identification\/quantification, followed by a summary of the current knowledge on their formation mechanisms and physicochemical properties. A main aim is to provide a common frame for the currently quite fragmented literature on HOM studies. Finally, we highlight the existing gaps in our understanding and suggest directions for future HOM research.","864":"","865":"","866":"","867":"The amphipathic nature of the lipid molecule (hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails) enables it to act as a barrier between fluids with various properties and to sustain an environment where the processes critical to life may proceed. While computer simulations of biomolecules primarily investigate protein conformation and binding to drug-like molecules, these interactions often occur in the context of a lipid membrane. Chemical specificity of lipid models is essential to accurately represent the complex environment of the lipid membrane. This review discusses the development and performance of currently used chemically specific lipid force fields (FF) such as the CHARMM, AMBER, GROMOS, OPLS, and MARTINI families. Considerations in lipid FF development including lipid diversity, temperature dependence, phase behavior, and effects of atomic polarizability are considered, as well as methods and goals of parametrization. Applications of these FFs to complex and diverse models for cellular membranes are summarized. Lastly, areas for future development, such as efficient inclusion of long-range Lennard-Jones interactions (significant in transitions from polar to apolar media), accurate transmembrane dipole potential, and diffusion under periodic boundary conditions are considered.","868":"With their mechanistic novelty and various modalities of reactivity, transition metal unsaturated carbene (alkenylidene) complexes have emerged as versatile intermediates for new reaction discovery. In particular, the past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in the chemistry of metal vinylidenes and allenylidenes, leading to the evolution of a diverse array of new catalytic transformations that are mechanistically distinct from those developed in the previous two decades. This review aims to provide a survey of the recent achievements in the development of organic reactions that make use of transition metal alkenylidenes as catalytic intermediates and their applications to organic synthesis.","869":"The synthesis of renewable fuels from abundant water or the greenhouse gas CO2 is a major step toward creating sustainable and scalable energy storage technologies. In the last few decades, much attention has focused on the development of nonprecious metal-based catalysts and, in more recent years, their integration in solid-state support materials and devices that operate in water. This review surveys the literature on 3d metal-based molecular catalysts and focuses on their immobilization on heterogeneous solid-state supports for electro-, photo-, and photoelectrocatalytic synthesis of fuels in aqueous media. The first sections highlight benchmark homogeneous systems using proton and CO2 reducing 3d transition metal catalysts as well as commonly employed methods for catalyst immobilization, including a discussion of supporting materials and anchoring groups. The subsequent sections elaborate on productive associations between molecular catalysts and a wide range of substrates based on carbon, quantum dots, metal oxide surfaces, and semiconductors. The molecule-material hybrid systems are organized as \"dark\" cathodes, colloidal photocatalysts, and photocathodes, and their figures of merit are discussed alongside system stability and catalyst integrity. The final section extends the scope of this review to prospects and challenges in targeting catalysis beyond \"classical\" H2 evolution and CO2 reduction to C1 products, by summarizing cases for higher-value products from N2 reduction, C x&gt;1 products from CO2 utilization, and other reductive organic transformations.","870":"Photoreduction of CO2 into sustainable and green solar fuels is generally believed to be an appealing solution to simultaneously overcome both environmental problems and energy crisis. The low selectivity of challenging multi-electron CO2 photoreduction reactions makes it one of the holy grails in heterogeneous photocatalysis. This Review highlights the important roles of cocatalysts in selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction into solar fuels using semiconductor catalysts. A special emphasis in this review is placed on the key role, design considerations and modification strategies of cocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction. Various cocatalysts, such as the biomimetic, metal-based, metal-free, and multifunctional ones, and their selectivity for CO2 photoreduction are summarized and discussed, along with the recent advances in this area. This Review provides useful information for the design of highly selective cocatalysts for photo(electro)reduction and electroreduction of CO2 and complements the existing reviews on various semiconductor photocatalysts.","871":"Metal halide perovskites represent a flourishing area of research, which is driven by both their potential application in photovoltaics and optoelectronics and by the fundamental science behind their unique optoelectronic properties. The emergence of new colloidal methods for the synthesis of halide perovskite nanocrystals, as well as the interesting characteristics of this new type of material, has attracted the attention of many researchers. This review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of this fast-moving field and will mainly focus on the different colloidal synthesis approaches that have been developed. We will examine the chemistry and the capability of different colloidal synthetic routes with regard to controlling the shape, size, and optical properties of the resulting nanocrystals. We will also provide an up-to-date overview of their postsynthesis transformations, and summarize the various solution processes that are aimed at fabricating halide perovskite-based nanocomposites. Furthermore, we will review the fundamental optical properties of halide perovskite nanocrystals by focusing on their linear optical properties, on the effects of quantum confinement, and on the current knowledge of their exciton binding energies. We will also discuss the emergence of nonlinear phenomena such as multiphoton absorption, biexcitons, and carrier multiplication. Finally, we will discuss open questions and possible future directions.","872":"Membrane lipids interact with proteins in a variety of ways, ranging from providing a stable membrane environment for proteins to being embedded in to detailed roles in complicated and well-regulated protein functions. Experimental and computational advances are converging in a rapidly expanding research area of lipid-protein interactions. Experimentally, the database of high-resolution membrane protein structures is growing, as are capabilities to identify the complex lipid composition of different membranes, to probe the challenging time and length scales of lipid-protein interactions, and to link lipid-protein interactions to protein function in a variety of proteins. Computationally, more accurate membrane models and more powerful computers now enable a detailed look at lipid-protein interactions and increasing overlap with experimental observations for validation and joint interpretation of simulation and experiment. Here we review papers that use computational approaches to study detailed lipid-protein interactions, together with brief experimental and physiological contexts, aiming at comprehensive coverage of simulation papers in the last five years. Overall, a complex picture of lipid-protein interactions emerges, through a range of mechanisms including modulation of the physical properties of the lipid environment, detailed chemical interactions between lipids and proteins, and key functional roles of very specific lipids binding to well-defined binding sites on proteins. Computationally, despite important limitations, molecular dynamics simulations with current computer power and theoretical models are now in an excellent position to answer detailed questions about lipid-protein interactions.","873":"","874":"To execute their many vital functions, cell membranes are highly organized. Here, we review how membrane structure shapes signal transduction across membranes. Recent experimental and computational advances have shed significant light on mechanisms linking the function of membrane signaling proteins to the composition and physical properties of the membrane lateral structures in which they are embedded. We provide an overview of the structural characteristics of membranes containing heterogeneous mixtures of lipids and other molecules and summarize work on \"raft\" domains in model and cell membranes, as determined by microscopy, spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and computer simulations. We discuss the principles of partitioning of proteins into membranes and how the structure, dynamics, and function of membrane-embedded and peripheral proteins can be modulated by specific membrane components and physical properties of membranes and raft domains. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions toward a molecular-level understanding of how membrane organization gives rise to various context-dependent cellular signaling.","875":"Diarylprolinol silyl ethers are among the most utilized stereoselective organocatalysts for the construction of complex molecules. With their debut in 2005, these catalysts have been applied in numerous method developments primarily leveraging enamine and iminium-ion catalysis. These strategies have extended into the preparation of complex molecules in both academic and industrial settings. This Review intends to give an overview of the application of the diarylprolinol silyl ether catalysts in total synthesis. Furthermore, integration of these catalysts in patent literature is also disclosed highlighting the versatility of the catalytic system.","876":"This Review illustrates the evaluation of permeability of lipid membranes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation primarily using water and oxygen as examples. Membrane entrance, translocation, and exit of these simple permeants (one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic) can be simulated by conventional MD, and permeabilities can be evaluated directly by Fick's First Law, transition rates, and a global Bayesian analysis of the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model. The assorted results, many of which are applicable to simulations of nonbiological membranes, highlight the limitations of the homogeneous solubility diffusion model; support the utility of inhomogeneous solubility diffusion and compartmental models; underscore the need for comparison with experiment for both simple solvent systems (such as water\/hexadecane) and well-characterized membranes; and demonstrate the need for microsecond simulations for even simple permeants like water and oxygen. Undulations, subdiffusion, fractional viscosity dependence, periodic boundary conditions, and recent developments in the field are also discussed. Last, while enhanced sampling methods and increasingly sophisticated treatments of diffusion add substantially to the repertoire of simulation-based approaches, they do not address directly the critical need for force fields with polarizability and multipoles, and constant pH methods.","877":null,"878":"Natural products (NPs) are important sources of clinical drugs due to their structural diversity and biological prevalidation. However, the structural complexity of NPs leads to synthetic difficulties, unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and poor drug-likeness. Structural simplification by truncating unnecessary substructures is a powerful strategy for overcoming these limitations and improving the efficiency and success rate of NP-based drug development. Herein, we will provide a comprehensive review of the structural simplification of NPs with a focus on design strategies, case studies, and new technologies. In particular, a number of successful examples leading to marketed drugs or drug candidates will be discussed in detail to illustrate how structural simplification is applied in lead optimization of NPs.","879":null,"880":"Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a biologically relevant reactive oxygen species capable of efficiently reacting with cellular constituents. The resulting oxidatively generated damage to nucleic acids, membrane unsaturated lipids, and protein components has been shown to be implicated in several diseases, including arthritis, cataracts, and skin cancer. Singlet oxygen may be endogenously produced, among various possibilities, by myeloperoxidase, an enzyme implicated in inflammation processes, and also efficiently in skin by the UVA component of solar radiation through photosensitization reactions. Emphasis is placed in this Review on the description of the main oxidation reactions initiated by 1O2 and the resulting modifications within key cellular targets, including guanine for nucleic acids, unsaturated lipids, and targeted amino acids. Most of these reactions give rise to peroxides and dioxetanes, whose formation has been rationalized in terms of [4+2] cycloaddition and 1,2-cycloaddition with dienes + olefins, respectively. The use of [18O]-labeled thermolabile endoperoxides as a source of [18O]-labeled 1O2 has been applied to study mechanistic aspects and preferential targets of 1O2 in biological systems. A relevant major topic deals with the search for the molecular signature of the 1O2 formation in targeted biomolecules within cells. It may be anticipated that [18O]-labeled 1O2 and labeled peroxides in association with sensitive mass spectrometric methods should constitute powerful tools for this purpose.","881":"The predictable nature of DNA interactions enables the programmable assembly of highly advanced 2D and 3D DNA structures of nanoscale dimensions. The access to ever larger and more complex structures has been achieved through decades of work on developing structural design principles. Concurrently, an increased focus has emerged on the applications of DNA nanostructures. In its nature, DNA is chemically inert and nanostructures based on unmodified DNA mostly lack function. However, functionality can be obtained through chemical modification of DNA nanostructures and the opportunities are endless. In this review, we discuss methodology for chemical functionalization of DNA nanostructures and provide examples of how this is being used to create functional nanodevices and make DNA nanostructures more applicable. We aim to encourage researchers to adopt chemical modifications as part of their work in DNA nanotechnology and inspire chemists to address current challenges and opportunities within the field.","882":"Dynamic DNA nanotechnology, a subfield of DNA nanotechnology, is concerned with the study and application of nucleic acid strand-displacement reactions. Strand-displacement reactions generally proceed by three-way or four-way branch migration and initially were investigated for their relevance to genetic recombination. Through the use of toeholds, which are single-stranded segments of DNA to which an invader strand can bind to initiate branch migration, the rate with which strand displacement reactions proceed can be varied by more than 6 orders of magnitude. In addition, the use of toeholds enables the construction of enzyme-free DNA reaction networks exhibiting complex dynamical behavior. A demonstration of this was provided in the year 2000, in which strand displacement reactions were employed to drive a DNA-based nanomachine (Yurke, B.; et al. Nature 2000, 406, 605-608). Since then, toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions have been used with ever increasing sophistication and the field of dynamic DNA nanotechnology has grown exponentially. Besides molecular machines, the field has produced enzyme-free catalytic systems, all DNA chemical oscillators and the most complex molecular computers yet devised. Enzyme-free catalytic systems can function as chemical amplifiers and as such have received considerable attention for sensing and detection applications in chemistry and medical diagnostics. Strand-displacement reactions have been combined with other enzymatically driven processes and have also been employed within living cells (Groves, B.; et al. Nat. Nanotechnol. 2015, 11, 287-294). Strand-displacement principles have also been applied in synthetic biology to enable artificial gene regulation and computation in bacteria. Given the enormous progress of dynamic DNA nanotechnology over the past years, the field now seems poised for practical application.","883":"Tetrazole derivatives are a prime class of heterocycles, very important to medicinal chemistry and drug design due to not only their bioisosterism to carboxylic acid and amide moieties but also to their metabolic stability and other beneficial physicochemical properties. Although more than 20 FDA-approved drugs contain 1 H- or 2 H-tetrazole substituents, their exact binding mode, structural biology, 3D conformations, and in general their chemical behavior is not fully understood. Importantly, multicomponent reaction (MCR) chemistry offers convergent access to multiple tetrazole scaffolds providing the three important elements of novelty, diversity, and complexity, yet MCR pathways to tetrazoles are far from completely explored. Here, we review the use of multicomponent reactions for the preparation of substituted tetrazole derivatives. We highlight specific applications and general trends holding therein and discuss synthetic approaches and their value by analyzing scope and limitations, and also enlighten their receptor binding mode. Finally, we estimated the prospects of further research in this field.","884":null,"885":"Copper is one of the most abundant and less toxic transition metals. Nature takes advantage of the bioavailability and rich redox chemistry of Cu to carry out oxygenase and oxidase organic transformations using O2 (or H2O2) as oxidant. Inspired by the reactivity of these Cu-dependent metalloenzymes, chemists have developed synthetic protocols to functionalize organic molecules under enviormentally benign conditions. Copper also promotes other transformations usually catalyzed by 4d and 5d transition metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, etc.) such as nitrene insertions or C-C and C-heteroatom coupling reactions. In this review, we summarized the most relevant research in which copper promotes or catalyzes the functionalization of organic molecules, including biological catalysis, bioinspired model systems, and organometallic reactivity. The reaction mechanisms by which these processes take place are discussed in detail.","886":"The term B-factor, sometimes called the Debye-Waller factor, temperature factor, or atomic displacement parameter, is used in protein crystallography to describe the attenuation of X-ray or neutron scattering caused by thermal motion. This review begins with analyses of early protein studies which suggested that B-factors, available from the Protein Data Bank, can be used to identify the flexibility of atoms, side chains, or even whole regions. This requires a technique for obtaining normalized B-factors. Since then the exploitation of B-factors has been extensively elaborated and applied in a variety of studies with quite different goals, all having in common the identification and interpretation of rigidity, flexibility, and\/or internal motion which are crucial in enzymes and in proteins in general. Importantly, this review includes a discussion of limitations and possible pitfalls when using B-factors. A second research area, which likewise exploits B-factors, is also reviewed, namely, the development of the so-called B-FIT-directed evolution method for increasing the thermostability of enzymes as catalysts in organic chemistry and biotechnology. In both research areas, a maximum of structural and mechanistic insights is gained when B-factor analyses are combined with other experimental and computational techniques.","887":"This Review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical review of general interest to the chemistry community (both academia and industry) as it contains an extensive overview of all published data on the homopolymerization of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), detailing the TFE homopolymerization process and the resulting chemical and physical properties. Several reviews and encyclopedia chapters on the properties and applications of fluoropolymers in general have been published, including various reviews that extensively report copolymers of TFE (listed below). Despite this, a thorough review of the specific methods of synthesis of the homopolymer, and the relationships between synthesis conditions and the physicochemical properties of the material prepared, has not been available. This Review intends to fill that gap. As known, PTFE and its marginally modified derivatives comprise some 60-65% of the total international fluoropolymer market with a global increase of ca. 7% per annum of its production. Numerous companies, such as Asahi Glass, Solvay Specialty Polymers, Daikin, DuPont\/Chemours, Juhua, 3F, 3M\/Dyneon, etc., produce TFE homopolymers. Such polymers, both high-molecular-mass materials and waxes, are chemically inert and hydrophobic and exhibit an excellent thermal stability as well as an exceptionally low coefficient of friction. These polymers find use in applications ranging from coatings and lubrication to pyrotechnics, and an extensive industry (electronic, aerospace, wires and cables, and textiles) has been built around them. South Africa, being the third largest producer of fluorspar (CaF2), the precursor to hydrogen fluoride and fluorine, has embarked on an industrial initiative to locally beneficiate its fluorspar reserves, with the local production of fluoropolymers being one projected outcome. As our manuscript focuses specifically on the homopolymerization of TFE (the starting point for all fluoropolymer industries), it will be of considerable use to start-up companies and other commercial entities looking to enter the fluoropolymer market, as well as to end-user companies. The manuscript commences with a short discussion on the synthesis and production of TFE (both at industrial and laboratory scales), including the safety aspects surrounding handling (because that monomer is regarded as explosive if brought into contact with oxygen due to the formation of peroxides), transport, and storage, and then expands into detailed discussions dealing with aspects such as the various additives used (buffers, chain transfer agents, surfactants, etc.), the solvent environment, and the reaction conditions. A further section reports the properties of PTFE with respect to the polymerization conditions as well as an overview on the specialized techniques used to characterize PTFE. Finally, the applications of PTFE in various fields, ranging from electrical insulation to tribological to medical applications, as well as chemically resistant coatings and pyrotechnics, are discussed.","888":"Layered halide perovskites offer a versatile platform for manipulating light through synthetic design. Although most layered perovskites absorb strongly in the ultraviolet (UV) or near-UV region, their emission can range from the UV to the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This emission can be very narrow, displaying high color purity, or it can be extremely broad, spanning the entire visible spectrum and providing high color rendition (or accurately reproducing illuminated colors). The origin of the photoluminescence can vary enormously. Strongly correlated electron-hole pairs, permanent lattice defects, transient light-induced defects, and ligand-field transitions in the inorganic layers and molecular chromophores in the organic layers can be involved in the emission mechanism. In this review, we highlight the different types of photoluminescence that may be attained from layered halide perovskites, with an emphasis on how the emission may be systematically tuned through changes to the bulk crystalline lattice: changes in composition, structure, and dimensionality.","889":"Bio-integrated wearable systems can measure a broad range of biophysical, biochemical, and environmental signals to provide critical insights into overall health status and to quantify human performance. Recent advances in material science, chemical analysis techniques, device designs, and assembly methods form the foundations for a uniquely differentiated type of wearable technology, characterized by noninvasive, intimate integration with the soft, curved, time-dynamic surfaces of the body. This review summarizes the latest advances in this emerging field of \"bio-integrated\" technologies in a comprehensive manner that connects fundamental developments in chemistry, material science, and engineering with sensing technologies that have the potential for widespread deployment and societal benefit in human health care. An introduction to the chemistries and materials for the active components of these systems contextualizes essential design considerations for sensors and associated platforms that appear in following sections. The subsequent content highlights the most advanced biosensors, classified according to their ability to capture biophysical, biochemical, and environmental information. Additional sections feature schemes for electrically powering these sensors and strategies for achieving fully integrated, wireless systems. The review concludes with an overview of key remaining challenges and a summary of opportunities where advances in materials chemistry will be critically important for continued progress.","890":"","891":"The study of main-group molecules that behave and react similarly to transition-metal (TM) complexes has attracted significant interest in recent decades. Most notably, the attractive idea of replacing the all-too-often rare and costly metals from catalysis has motivated efforts to develop main-group-element-mediated reactions. Main-group elements, however, lack the electronic flexibility of TM complexes that arises from combinations of empty and filled d orbitals and that seem ideally suited to bind and activate many substrates. In this review, we look at boron, an element that despite its nonmetal nature, low atomic weight, and relative redox staticity has achieved great milestones in terms of TM-like reactivity. We show how in interelement cooperative systems, diboron molecules, and hypovalent complexes the fifth element can acquire a truly metallomimetic character. As we discuss, this character is powerfully demonstrated by the reactivity of boron-based molecules with H2, CO, alkynes, alkenes and even with N2.","892":"While medicinal inorganic chemistry has been practised for over 5000 years, it was not until the late 1800s when Alfred Werner published his ground-breaking research on coordination chemistry that we began to truly understand the nature of the coordination bond and the structures and stereochemistries of metal complexes. We can now readily manipulate and fine-tune their properties. This had led to a multitude of complexes with wide-ranging biomedical applications. This review will focus on the use and potential of metal complexes as important therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. With major advances in technologies and a deeper understanding of the human genome, we are now in a strong position to more fully understand carcinogenesis at a molecular level. We can now also rationally design and develop drug molecules that can either selectively enhance or disrupt key biological processes and, in doing so, optimize their therapeutic potential. This has heralded a new era in drug design in which we are moving from a single- toward a multitargeted approach. This approach lies at the very heart of medicinal inorganic chemistry. In this review, we have endeavored to showcase how a \"multitargeted\" approach to drug design has led to new families of metallodrugs which may not only reduce systemic toxicities associated with modern day chemotherapeutics but also address resistance issues that are plaguing many chemotherapeutic regimens. We have focused our attention on metallodrugs incorporating platinum and ruthenium ions given that complexes containing these metal ions are already in clinical use or have advanced to clinical trials as anticancer agents. The \"multitargeted\" complexes described herein not only target DNA but also contain either vectors to enable them to target cancer cells selectively and\/or moieties that target enzymes, peptides, and intracellular proteins. Multitargeted complexes which have been designed to target the mitochondria or complexes inspired by natural product activity are also described. A summary of advances in this field over the past decade or so will be provided.","893":"Hybrid halide perovskites are now superstar materials leading the field of low-cost thin film photovoltaics technologies. Following the surge for more efficient and stable 3D bulk alloys, multilayered halide perovskites and colloidal perovskite nanostructures appeared in 2016 as viable alternative solutions to this challenge, largely exceeding the original proof of concept made in 2009 and 2014, respectively. This triggered renewed interest in lower-dimensional hybrid halide perovskites and at the same time increasingly more numerous and differentiated applications. The present paper is a review of the past and present literature on both colloidal nanostructures and multilayered compounds, emphasizing that availability of accurate structural information is of dramatic importance to reach a fair understanding of quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Layered halide perovskites occupy a special place in the history of halide perovskites, with a large number of seminal papers in the 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, the rationalization of structure-properties relationship has greatly benefited from new theoretical approaches dedicated to their electronic structures and optoelectronic properties, as well as a growing number of contributions based on modern experimental techniques. This is a necessary step to provide in-depth tools to decipher their extensive chemical engineering possibilities which surpass the ones of their 3D bulk counterparts. Comparisons to classical semiconductor nanostructures and 2D van der Waals heterostructures are also stressed. Since 2015, colloidal nanostructures have undergone a quick development for applications based on light emission. Although intensively studied in the last two years by various spectroscopy techniques, the description of quantum and dielectric confinement effects on their optoelectronic properties is still in its infancy.","894":"Membrane permeabilizing peptides (MPPs) are as ubiquitous as the lipid bilayer membranes they act upon. Produced by all forms of life, most membrane permeabilizing peptides are used offensively or defensively against the membranes of other organisms. Just as nature has found many uses for them, translational scientists have worked for decades to design or optimize membrane permeabilizing peptides for applications in the laboratory and in the clinic ranging from antibacterial and antiviral therapy and prophylaxis to anticancer therapeutics and drug delivery. Here, we review the field of membrane permeabilizing peptides. We discuss the diversity of their sources and structures, the systems and methods used to measure their activities, and the behaviors that are observed. We discuss the fact that \"mechanism\" is not a discrete or a static entity for an MPP but rather the result of a heterogeneous and dynamic ensemble of structural states that vary in response to many different experimental conditions. This has led to an almost complete lack of discrete three-dimensional active structures among the thousands of known MPPs and a lack of useful or predictive sequence-structure-function relationship rules. Ultimately, we discuss how it may be more useful to think of membrane permeabilizing peptides mechanisms as broad regions of a mechanistic landscape rather than discrete molecular processes.","895":"Cell membranes contain a large variety of lipid types and are crowded with proteins, endowing them with the plasticity needed to fulfill their key roles in cell functioning. The compositional complexity of cellular membranes gives rise to a heterogeneous lateral organization, which is still poorly understood. Computational models, in particular molecular dynamics simulations and related techniques, have provided important insight into the organizational principles of cell membranes over the past decades. Now, we are witnessing a transition from simulations of simpler membrane models to multicomponent systems, culminating in realistic models of an increasing variety of cell types and organelles. Here, we review the state of the art in the field of realistic membrane simulations and discuss the current limitations and challenges ahead.","896":"Platinum-containing drugs (e.g., cisplatin) are among the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agents. Their tremendous success has spurred research and development of other metal-based drugs, with notable achievements. Generally, the vast majority of metal-based drug candidates in clinical and developmental stages are stoichiometric agents, i.e., each metal complex reacts only once with their biological target. Additionally, many of these metal complexes are involved in side reactions, which not only reduce the effective amount of the drug but may also cause toxicity. On a separate note, transition metal complexes and nanoparticles have a well-established history of being potent catalysts for selective molecular transformations, with examples such as the Mo- and Ru-based catalysts for metathesis reactions (Nobel Prize in 2005) or palladium catalysts for C-C bond forming reactions such as Heck, Negishi, or Suzuki reactions (Nobel Prize in 2010). Also, notably, no direct biological equivalent of these transformations exists in a biological environment such as bacteria or mammalian cells. It is, therefore, only logical that recent interest has focused on developing transition-metal based catalytic systems that are capable of performing transformations inside cells, with the aim of inducing medicinally relevant cellular changes. Because unlike in stoichiometric reactions, a catalytically active compound may turn over many substrate molecules, only very small amounts of such a catalytic metallodrug are required to achieve a desired pharmacologic effect, and therefore, toxicity and side reactions are reduced. Furthermore, performing catalytic reactions in biological systems also opens the door for new methodologies to study the behavior of biomolecules in their natural state, e.g., via in situ labeling or by increasing\/depleting their concentration at will. There is, of course, an art to the choice of catalysts and reactions which have to be compatible with biological conditions, namely an aqueous, oxygen-containing environment. In this review, we aim to describe new developments that bring together the far-distant worlds of transition-metal based catalysis and metal-based drugs, in what is termed \"catalytic metallodrugs\". Here we will focus on transformations that have been performed on small biomolecules (such as shifting equilibria like in the NAD+\/NADH or GSH\/GSSG couples), on non-natural molecules such as dyes for imaging purposes, or on biomacromolecules such as proteins. Neither reactions involving release (e.g., CO) or transformation of small molecules (e.g., 1O2 production), degradation of biomolecules such as proteins, RNA or DNA nor light-induced medicinal chemistry (e.g., photodynamic therapy) are covered, even if metal complexes are centrally involved in those. In each section, we describe the (inorganic) chemistry involved, as well as selected examples of biological applications in the hope that this snapshot of a new but quickly developing field will indeed inspire novel research and unprecedented interactions across disciplinary boundaries.","897":"Advances over the past 25 years have revealed much about how the structural properties of membranes and associated proteins are linked to the thermodynamics and kinetics of membrane protein (MP) folding. At the same time biochemical progress has outlined how cellular proteostasis networks mediate MP folding and manage misfolding in the cell. When combined with results from genomic sequencing, these studies have established paradigms for how MP folding and misfolding are linked to the molecular etiologies of a variety of diseases. This emerging framework has paved the way for the development of a new class of small molecule \"pharmacological chaperones\" that bind to and stabilize misfolded MP variants, some of which are now in clinical use. In this review, we comprehensively outline current perspectives on the folding and misfolding of integral MPs as well as the mechanisms of cellular MP quality control. Based on these perspectives, we highlight new opportunities for innovations that bridge our molecular understanding of the energetics of MP folding with the nuanced complexity of biological systems. Given the many linkages between MP misfolding and human disease, we also examine some of the exciting opportunities to leverage these advances to address emerging challenges in the development of therapeutics and precision medicine.","898":"DNA has played an early and powerful role in the development of bottom-up nanotechnologies, not least because of DNA's precise, predictable, and controllable properties of assembly on the nanometer scale. Watson-Crick complementarity has been used to build complex 2D and 3D architectures and design a number of nanometer-scale systems for molecular computing, transport, motors, and biosensing applications. Most of such devices are built with classical B-DNA helices and involve classical A-T\/U and G-C base pairs. However, in addition to the above components underlying the iconic double helix, a number of alternative pairing schemes of nucleobases are known. This review focuses on two of these noncanonical classes of DNA helices: G-quadruplexes and the i-motif. The unique properties of these two classes of DNA helix have been utilized toward some remarkable constructions and applications: G-wires; nanostructures such as DNA origami; reconfigurable structures and nanodevices; the formation and utilization of hemin-utilizing DNAzymes, capable of generating varied outputs from biosensing nanostructures; composite nanostructures made up of DNA as well as inorganic materials; and the construction of nanocarriers that show promise for the therapeutics of diseases.","899":"Electrically-transduced sensors, with their simplicity and compatibility with standard electronic technologies, produce signals that can be efficiently acquired, processed, stored, and analyzed. Two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, including graphene, phosphorene (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and others, have proven to be attractive for the fabrication of high-performance electrically-transduced chemical sensors due to their remarkable electronic and physical properties originating from their 2D structure. This review highlights the advances in electrically-transduced chemical sensing that rely on 2D materials. The structural components of such sensors are described, and the underlying operating principles for different types of architectures are discussed. The structural features, electronic properties, and surface chemistry of 2D nanostructures that dictate their sensing performance are reviewed. Key advances in the application of 2D materials, from both a historical and analytical perspective, are summarized for four different groups of analytes: gases, volatile compounds, ions, and biomolecules. The sensing performance is discussed in the context of the molecular design, structure-property relationships, and device fabrication technology. The outlook of challenges and opportunities for 2D nanomaterials for the future development of electrically-transduced sensors is also presented.","900":"Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is the most popular chromatographic mode, accounting for more than 90% of all separations. HPLC itself owes its immense popularity to it being relatively simple and inexpensive, with the equipment being reliable and easy to operate. Due to extensive automation, it can be run virtually unattended with multiple samples at various separation conditions, even by relatively low-skilled personnel. Currently, there are &gt;600 RP-HPLC columns available to end users for purchase, some of which exhibit very large differences in selectivity and production quality. Often, two similar RP-HPLC columns are not equally suitable for the requisite separation, and to date, there is no universal RP-HPLC column covering a variety of analytes. This forces analytical laboratories to keep a multitude of diverse columns. Therefore, column selection is a crucial segment of RP-HPLC method development, especially since sample complexity is constantly increasing. Rationally choosing an appropriate column is complicated. In addition to the differences in the primary intermolecular interactions with analytes of the dispersive (London) type, individual columns can also exhibit a unique character owing to specific polar, hydrogen bond, and electron pair donor-acceptor interactions. They can also vary depending on the type of packing, amount and type of residual silanols, \"end-capping\", bonding density of ligands, and pore size, among others. Consequently, the chromatographic performance of RP-HPLC systems is often considerably altered depending on the selected column. Although a wide spectrum of knowledge is available on this important subject, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review for an objective comparison and\/or selection of chromatographic columns. We aim for this review to be a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and easily readable monograph of the most relevant publications regarding column selection and characterization in RP-HPLC covering the past four decades. Future perspectives, which involve the integration of state-of-the-art molecular simulations (molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo) with minimal experiments, aimed at nearly \"experiment-free\" column selection methodology, are proposed.","901":"The use of 3d metals in de\/hydrogenation catalysis has emerged as a competitive field with respect to \"traditional\" precious metal catalyzed transformations. The introduction of functional pincer ligands that can store protons and\/or electrons as expressed by metal-ligand cooperativity and ligand redox-activity strongly stimulated this development as a conceptual starting point for rational catalyst design. This review aims at providing a comprehensive picture of the utilization of functional pincer ligands in first-row transition metal hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis and related synthetic concepts relying on these such as the hydrogen borrowing methodology. Particular emphasis is put on the implementation and relevance of cooperating and redox-active pincer ligands within the mechanistic scenarios.","902":"Organic\/inorganic nanohybrids have attracted widespread interests due to their favorable properties and promising applications in biomedical areas. Great efforts have been made to design and fabricate versatile nanohybrids. Among different organic components, diverse polymers offer unique avenues for multifunctional systems with collective properties. This review focuses on the design, properties, and biomedical applications of organic\/inorganic nanohybrids fabricated from inorganic nanoparticles and polymers. We begin with a brief introduction to a variety of strategies for the fabrication of functional organic\/inorganic nanohybrids. Then the properties and functions of nanohybrids are discussed, including properties from organic and inorganic parts, synergistic properties, morphology-dependent properties, and self-assembly of nanohybrids. After that, current situations of nanohybrids applied for imaging, therapy, and imaging-guided therapy are demonstrated. Finally, we discuss the prospect of organic\/inorganic nanohybrids and highlight the challenges and opportunities for the future investigations.","903":"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play important roles in cell growth, motility, differentiation, and survival. These single-pass membrane proteins are grouped into subfamilies based on the similarity of their extracellular domains. They are generally thought to be activated by ligand binding, which promotes homodimerization and then autophosphorylation in trans. However, RTK interactions are more complicated, as RTKs can interact in the absence of ligand and heterodimerize within and across subfamilies. Here, we review the known cross-subfamily RTK heterointeractions and their possible biological implications, as well as the methodologies which have been used to study them. Moreover, we demonstrate how thermodynamic models can be used to study RTKs and to explain many of the complicated biological effects which have been described in the literature. Finally, we discuss the concept of the RTK interactome: a putative, extensive network of interactions between the RTKs. This RTK interactome can produce unique signaling outputs; can amplify, inhibit, and modify signaling; and can allow for signaling backups. The existence of the RTK interactome could provide an explanation for the irreproducibility of experimental data from different studies and for the failure of some RTK inhibitors to produce the desired therapeutic effects. We argue that a deeper knowledge of RTK interactome thermodynamics can lead to a better understanding of fundamental RTK signaling processes in health and disease. We further argue that there is a need for quantitative, thermodynamic studies that probe the strengths of the interactions between RTKs and their ligands and between different RTKs.","904":"In this review, we summarize the origin and advancements of iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions during the past two decades. Since the first report in 1997, Ir-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions have attracted intense attention due to their exceptionally high regio- and enantioselectivities. Ir-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions have been significantly developed in recent years in many respects, including ligand development, mechanistic understanding, substrate scope, and application in the synthesis of complex functional molecules. In this review, an explicit outline of ligands, mechanism, scope of nucleophiles, and applications is presented.","905":"Two-dimensional materials and single-atom catalysts are two frontier research fields in catalysis. A new category of catalysts with the integration of both aspects has been rapidly developed in recent years, and significant advantages were established to make it an independent research field. In this Review, we will focus on the concept of two-dimensional materials confining single atoms for catalysis. The new electronic states via the integration lead to their mutual benefits in activity, that is, two-dimensional materials with unique geometric and electronic structures can modulate the catalytic performance of the confined single atoms, and in other cases the confined single atoms can in turn affect the intrinsic activity of two-dimensional materials. Three typical two-dimensional materials are mainly involved here, i.e., graphene, g-C3N4, and MoS2, and the confined single atoms include both metal and nonmetal atoms. First, we systematically introduce and discuss the classic synthesis methods, advanced characterization techniques, and various catalytic applications toward two-dimensional materials confining single-atom catalysts. Finally, the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are featured on the basis of its current development.","906":"Cobalt has become increasingly attractive in homogeneous catalysis because of its unique characteristics and outstanding catalytic performance in addition to being cheap and earth-abundant. Hydride transfer processes are involved in a broad range of organic transformations that allow the facile preparation of various useful chemicals and synthetic building blocks. These reactions have continuously received great attention both from academia and industry. In this perspective, we review homogeneous cobalt-catalyzed hydride transfer reactions according to the classified reaction types and provide a comprehensive overview of the design, synthesis, and reactivity of cobalt catalysts, their catalytic applications, and reaction mechanisms.","907":"Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction technologies offer the promise of zero-carbon-emission renewable fuels needed for heavy-duty transportation. However, the inert nature of the CO2 molecule poses a fundamental challenge that must be overcome before efficient (photo)electrochemical CO2 reduction at scale will be achieved. Optimal catalysts exhibit enduring stability, fast kinetics, high selectivity, and low manufacturing cost. Identifying catalytic mechanisms of CO2 reduction in (photo)electrochemical systems could accelerate design of efficient catalysts. In recent decades, numerous theoretical studies have contributed to our understanding of CO2 reduction pathways and identifying rate-limiting steps. Although a significant body of work exists regarding homogeneous electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction, this review focuses specifically on the theory of heterogeneous (photo)electrochemical reduction. We first give an overview of the relevant thermodynamics and semiconductor physics. We then introduce important, widely used theoretical techniques and modeling approaches to catalysis. Recent progress in elucidating mechanisms of heterogeneous (photo)electrochemical CO2 reduction is discussed through the lens of two experimental systems: pyridine (Py)-catalyzed CO2 (photo)electrochemical reduction at p-GaP photoelectrodes and electrochemical CO2 reduction at Cu electrodes. We close by proposing strategies and principles for the future design of (photo)electrochemical catalysts to improve the selectivity and reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction.","908":"Pathogenic bacteria have always posed one of the most serious threats to public health, and continue to be especially dangerous with the rise in antibiotic resistance. The prevalence of these infectious agents necessitates rapid, point-of-care sensors for their detection, identification, and monitoring. Electrochemical sensors are promising for the low-cost monitoring of bacterial growth and the detection of specific microbial species due to the consistency and ease-of-use of impedance measurements. Though the commercialization of these sensors is currently limited, they offer significant promise for detecting pathogens from real-world environments.","909":"Cellular signaling networks are the foundation which determines the fate and function of cells as they respond to various cues and stimuli. The discovery of fluorescent proteins over 25 years ago enabled the development of a diverse array of genetically encodable fluorescent biosensors that are capable of measuring the spatiotemporal dynamics of signal transduction pathways in live cells. In an effort to encapsulate the breadth over which fluorescent biosensors have expanded, we endeavored to assemble a comprehensive list of published engineered biosensors, and we discuss many of the molecular designs utilized in their development. Then, we review how the high temporal and spatial resolution afforded by fluorescent biosensors has aided our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling networks at the cellular and subcellular level. Finally, we highlight some emerging areas of research in both biosensor design and applications that are on the forefront of biosensor development.","910":"The last two decades have seen an impressive improvement of the use of iron as a fascinating and valuable alternative transition metal in homogeneous catalysis in terms of sustainability and economy. It was efficiently used in catalytic organic synthetic transformations, which in particular include the reduction of unsaturated bonds. This review summarizes the fast development and the recent advances in selective reductions of olefins, alkynes, carbonyl and carboxylic derivatives, imines, and nitro compounds promoted by iron catalysts. The topical hydrogen-borrowing reactions and hydroboration of unsaturated compounds are also reported. It is hoped that this account not only provides an overview of the state of the art in iron catalysis but also stimulates the development of superior greener catalytic systems in the near future.","911":"This survey of metal-metal (MM) bond distances in binuclear complexes of the first row 3d-block elements reviews experimental and computational research on a wide range of such systems. The metals surveyed are titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc, representing the only comprehensive presentation of such results to date. Factors impacting MM bond lengths that are discussed here include (a) the formal MM bond order, (b) size of the metal ion present in the bimetallic core (M2) n+, (c) the metal oxidation state, (d) effects of ligand basicity, coordination mode and number, and (e) steric effects of bulky ligands. Correlations between experimental and computational findings are examined wherever possible, often yielding good agreement for MM bond lengths. The formal bond order provides a key basis for assessing experimental and computationally derived MM bond lengths. The effects of change in the metal upon MM bond length ranges in binuclear complexes suggest trends for single, double, triple, and quadruple MM bonds which are related to the available information on metal atomic radii. It emerges that while specific factors for a limited range of complexes are found to have their expected impact in many cases, the assessment of the net effect of these factors is challenging. The combination of experimental and computational results leads us to propose for the first time the ranges and \"best\" estimates for MM bond distances of all types (Ti-Ti through Zn-Zn, single through quintuple).","912":"","913":"There is great need for stand-alone luminescence-based chemosensors that exemplify selectivity, sensitivity, and applicability and that overcome the challenges that arise from complex, real-world media. Discussed herein are recent developments toward these goals in the field of supramolecular luminescent chemosensors, including macrocycles, polymers, and nanomaterials. Specific focus is placed on the development of new macrocycle hosts since 2010, coupled with considerations of the underlying principles of supramolecular chemistry as well as analytes of interest and common luminophores. State-of-the-art developments in the fields of polymer and nanomaterial sensors are also examined, and some remaining unsolved challenges in the area of chemosensors are discussed.","914":"Methods for site-selective transformations of hydroxyl groups in carbohydrate derivatives are reviewed. The construction of oligosaccharides of defined connectivity hinges on such transformations, which are also needed for the preparation of modified or non-natural sugar derivatives, the installation of naturally occurring postglycosylation modifications, the selective labeling or conjugation of carbohydrate derivatives, and the preparation of therapeutic agents or research tools for glycobiology. The review begins with a discussion of intrinsic factors and processes that can influence selectivity in reactions of unprotected or partially protected carbohydrate derivatives, followed by a description of transformations that engage two OH groups in cyclic adducts (acetals, ketals, boronic esters, and related species). An overview of the various classes of site-selective transformations of OH groups in sugars is then provided: the reactions discussed include esterification, thiocarbonylation, alkylation, glycosylation, arylation, silylation, phosphorylation, sulfonylation, sulfation, and oxidation. Emphasis is placed on recently developed methods that employ reagent or catalyst control to achieve otherwise challenging transformations or site-selectivities.","915":"Many first-line treatments for neglected tropical diseases identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) are limited by one or more of the following: the development of drug resistance, toxicity, and side effects, lack of selectivity, narrow therapeutic indices, route of administration, and bioavailability. As such, there is an urgent need to develop viable alternatives to overcome these limitations. The following review provides an overview of all existing metal complexes studied and evaluates the status of these complexes on the respective disease of choice.","916":null,"917":"The reduction of nitro compounds to the corresponding amines is one of the most utilized catalytic processes in the fine and bulk chemical industry. The latest development of catalysts with cheap metals like Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu has led to their tremendous achievements over the last years prompting their greater application as \"standard\" catalysts. In this review, we will comprehensively discuss the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts based on non-noble 3d-metals for the reduction of nitro compounds using various reductants. The different systems will be revised considering both the catalytic performances and synthetic aspects highlighting also their advantages and disadvantages.","918":"Infectious diseases claim millions of lives each year. Robust and accurate diagnostics are essential tools for identifying those who are at risk and in need of treatment in low-resource settings. Inorganic complexes and metal-based nanomaterials continue to drive the development of diagnostic platforms and strategies that enable infectious disease detection in low-resource settings. In this review, we highlight works from the past 20 years in which inorganic chemistry and nanotechnology were implemented in each of the core components that make up a diagnostic test. First, we present how inorganic biomarkers and their properties are leveraged for infectious disease detection. In the following section, we detail metal-based technologies that have been employed for sample preparation and biomarker isolation from sample matrices. We then describe how inorganic- and nanomaterial-based probes have been utilized in point-of-care diagnostics for signal generation. The following section discusses instrumentation for signal readout in resource-limited settings. Next, we highlight the detection of nucleic acids at the point of care as an emerging application of inorganic chemistry. Lastly, we consider the challenges that remain for translation of the aforementioned diagnostic platforms to low-resource settings.","919":"This Review covers a sequence of key discoveries and technical achievements that eventually led to the birth of the lithium-ion battery. In doing so, it not only sheds light on the history with the advantage of contemporary hindsight but also provides insight and inspiration to aid in the ongoing quest for better batteries of the future. A detailed retrospective on ingenious designs, accidental discoveries, intentional breakthroughs, and deceiving misconceptions is given: from the discovery of the element lithium to its electrochemical synthesis; from intercalation host material development to the concept of dual-intercalation electrodes; and from the misunderstanding of intercalation behavior into graphite to the comprehension of interphases. The onerous demands of bringing all critical components (anode, cathode, electrolyte, solid-electrolyte interphases), each of which possess unique chemistries, into a sophisticated electrochemical device reveal that the challenge of interfacing these originally incongruent components often outweighs the individual merits and limits in their own properties. These important lessons are likely to remain true for the more aggressive battery chemistries of future generations, ranging from a revisited Li-metal anode, to conversion-reaction type chemistries such as Li\/sulfur, Li\/oxygen, and metal fluorides, and to bivalent cation intercalations.","920":"This review aims to present the most recent contributions in the chemistry of nitrosoalkenes and azoalkenes, highlighting the chemical behavior that makes them important and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. These are heterodienes used in the assembly of a variety of heterocyclic systems, spanning from five- to seven-membered heterocycles, as well as for the functionalization of heterocycles.","921":"The immune system deploys a multitude of innate and adaptive mechanisms not only to ward off pathogens but also to prevent malignant transformation (\"immune surveillance\"). Hence, a clinically apparent tumor already reflects selection for those malignant cell clones capable of evading immune recognition (\"immune evasion\"). Metal drugs, besides their well-investigated cytotoxic anticancer effects, massively interact with the cancer-immune interface and can reverse important aspects of immune evasion. This topic has recently gained intense attention based on combination approaches with anticancer immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors), a strategy recently delivering first exciting results in clinical settings. This review summarizes the promising but still extremely fragmentary knowledge on the interplay of metal drugs with the fidelity of anticancer immune responses but also their role in adverse effects. It highlights that, at least in some cases, metal drugs can induce long-lasting anticancer immune responses. Important steps in this process comprise altered visibility and susceptibility of cancer cells toward innate and adaptive immunity, as well as direct impacts on immune cell populations and the tumor microenvironment. On the basis of the gathered information, we suggest initiating joint multidisciplinary programs to implement comprehensive immune analyses into strategies to develop novel and smart anticancer metal compounds.","922":"C-H activation has surfaced as an increasingly powerful tool for molecular sciences, with notable applications to material sciences, crop protection, drug discovery, and pharmaceutical industries, among others. Despite major advances, the vast majority of these C-H functionalizations required precious 4d or 5d transition metal catalysts. Given the cost-effective and sustainable nature of earth-abundant first row transition metals, the development of less toxic, inexpensive 3d metal catalysts for C-H activation has gained considerable recent momentum as a significantly more environmentally-benign and economically-attractive alternative. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview on first row transition metal catalysts for C-H activation until summer 2018.","923":"The highly contagious disease tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which has been evolving drug resistance at an alarming rate. Like all human pathogens, Mtb requires iron for growth and virulence. Consequently, Mtb iron transport is an emerging drug target. However, the development of anti-TB drugs aimed at these metabolic pathways has been restricted by the dearth of information on Mtb iron acquisition. In this Review, we describe the multiple strategies utilized by Mtb to acquire ferric iron and heme iron. Mtb iron uptake is a complex process, requiring biosynthesis and subsequent export of Mtb siderophores, followed by ferric iron scavenging and ferric-siderophore import into Mtb. Additionally, Mtb possesses two possible heme uptake pathways and an Mtb-specific mechanism of heme degradation that yields iron and novel heme-degradation products. We conclude with perspectives for potential therapeutics that could directly target Mtb heme and iron uptake machineries. We also highlight how hijacking Mtb heme and iron acquisition pathways for drug import may facilitate drug transport through the notoriously impregnable Mtb cell wall.","924":"The conservation of our element resources is a fundamental challenge of mankind. The development of alcohol refunctionalization reactions is a possible fossil carbon conservation strategy since alcohols can be obtained from indigestible and abundantly available biomass. The conservation of our rare noble metals, frequently used in key technologies such as catalysis, might be feasible by replacing them with highly abundant metals. The alkylation of amines by alcohols and related C-C coupling reactions are early examples of alcohol refunctionalization reactions. These reactions follow mostly the borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer catalysis concept, and many 3d-metal catalysts have been disclosed in recent years. In this review, we summarize the progress made in developing Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, and Mn catalysts for C-N and C-C bond formation reactions with alcohols and amines using the borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer concept. We expect that the findings in this field will inspire others to develop new efficient and selective earth-abundant metal catalysts for borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer applications or to develop novel alcohol refunctionalization reactions that can be mediated by such metals.","925":"This review article examines the current state of understanding in how metal halide perovskite solar cells can degrade when exposed to moisture, oxygen, heat, light, mechanical stress, and reverse bias. It also highlights strategies for improving stability, such as tuning the composition of the perovskite, introducing hydrophobic coatings, replacing metal electrodes with carbon or transparent conducting oxides, and packaging. The article concludes with recommendations on how accelerated testing should be performed to rapidly develop solar cells that are both extraordinarily efficient and stable.","926":"","927":"The strong and controllable chemical sensitivity of organic semiconductors (OSCs) and the amplification capability of transistors in circuits make use of OSC-based field-effect transistors compelling for chemical sensors. Analytes detected and assayed range from few-atom gas-phase molecules that may have adverse health and security implications to biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids) that may be markers for physiological processes and medical conditions. This review highlights recent progress in organic field-effect transistor (OFET) chemical sensors, emphasizing advances from the past 5 years and including aspects of OSC morphology and the role of adjacent dielectrics. Design elements of the OSCs and various formats for the devices are illustrated and evaluated. Challenges associated with the present state of the art and future opportunities are also discussed.","928":"With increasing environmental and ecological concerns due to the use of petroleum-based chemicals and products, the synthesis of fine chemicals and functional materials from natural resources is of great public value. Nanocellulose may prove to be one of the most promising green materials of modern times due to its intrinsic properties, renewability, and abundance. In this review, we present nanocellulose-based materials from sourcing, synthesis, and surface modification of nanocellulose, to materials formation and applications. Nanocellulose can be sourced from biomass, plants, or bacteria, relying on fairly simple, scalable, and efficient isolation techniques. Mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments, or a combination of these, can be used to extract nanocellulose from natural sources. The properties of nanocellulose are dependent on the source, the isolation technique, and potential subsequent surface transformations. Nanocellulose surface modification techniques are typically used to introduce either charged or hydrophobic moieties, and include amidation, esterification, etherification, silylation, polymerization, urethanization, sulfonation, and phosphorylation. Nanocellulose has excellent strength, high Young's modulus, biocompatibility, and tunable self-assembly, thixotropic, and photonic properties, which are essential for the applications of this material. Nanocellulose participates in the fabrication of a large range of nanomaterials and nanocomposites, including those based on polymers, metals, metal oxides, and carbon. In particular, nanocellulose complements organic-based materials, where it imparts its mechanical properties to the composite. Nanocellulose is a promising material whenever material strength, flexibility, and\/or specific nanostructuration are required. Applications include functional paper, optoelectronics, and antibacterial coatings, packaging, mechanically reinforced polymer composites, tissue scaffolds, drug delivery, biosensors, energy storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, and electrochemically controlled separation. Phosphorylated nanocellulose is a particularly interesting material, spanning a surprising set of applications in various dimensions including bone scaffolds, adsorbents, and flame retardants and as a support for the heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts.","929":"The past two decades have witnessed the emergence of macrocycles, including macrocyclic peptides, as a promising yet underexploited class of de novo drug candidates. Both rational\/computational design and in vitro display systems have contributed tremendously to the development of cyclic peptide binders of either traditional targets such as cell-surface receptors and enzymes or challenging targets such as protein-protein interaction surfaces. mRNA display, a key platform technology for the discovery of cyclic peptide ligands, has become one of the leading strategies that can generate natural-product-like macrocyclic peptide binders with antibody-like affinities. On the basis of the original cell-free transcription\/translation system, mRNA display is highly evolvable to realize its full potential by applying genetic reprogramming and chemical\/enzymatic modifications. In addition, mRNA display also allows the follow-up hit-to-lead development using high-throughput focused affinity maturation. Finally, mRNA-displayed peptides can be readily engineered to create chemical conjugates based on known small molecules or biologics. This review covers the birth and growth of mRNA display and discusses the above features of mRNA display with success stories and future perspectives and is up to date as of August 2018.","930":"Halide perovskites are an intriguing class of materials that have recently attracted considerable attention for use as the active layer in thin film optoelectronic devices, including thin-film transistors, light-emitting devices, and solar cells. The \"soft\" nature of these materials, as characterized by their low formation energy and Young's modulus, and high thermal expansion coefficients, not only enables thin films to be fabricated via low-temperature deposition methods but also presents rich opportunities for manipulating film formation. This comprehensive review explores how the unique chemistry of these materials can be exploited to tailor film growth processes and highlights the connections between processing methods and the resulting film characteristics. The discussion focuses principally on methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3), which serves as a useful and well-studied model system for examining the unique attributes of halide perovskites, but various other important members of this family are also considered. The resulting film properties are discussed in the context of the characteristics necessary for achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices and accurate measurement of physical properties.","931":"Radiometals possess an exceptional breadth of decay properties and have been applied to medicine with great success for several decades. The majority of current clinical use involves diagnostic procedures, which use either positron-emission tomography (PET) or single-photon imaging to detect anatomic abnormalities that are difficult to visualize using conventional imaging techniques (e.g., MRI and X-ray). The potential of therapeutic radiometals has more recently been realized and relies on ionizing radiation to induce irreversible DNA damage, resulting in cell death. In both cases, radiopharmaceutical development has been largely geared toward the field of oncology; thus, selective tumor targeting is often essential for efficacious drug use. To this end, the rational design of four-component radiopharmaceuticals has become popularized. This Review introduces fundamental concepts of drug design and applications, with particular emphasis on bifunctional chelators (BFCs), which ensure secure consolidation of the radiometal and targeting vector and are integral for optimal drug performance. Also presented are detailed accounts of production, chelation chemistry, and biological use of selected main group and rare earth radiometals.","932":"Preservation of the coding potential of the genome and highly regulated gene expression over the life span of a human are two fundamental requirements of life. These processes require the action of repair enzymes or transcription factors that efficiently recognize specific sites of DNA damage or transcriptional regulation within a restricted time frame of the cell cycle or metabolism. A failure of these systems to act results in accumulated mutations, metabolic dysfunction, and disease. Despite the multifactorial complexity of cellular DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, both processes share a fundamental physical requirement that the proteins must rapidly diffuse to their specific DNA-binding sites that are embedded within the context of a vastly greater number of nonspecific DNA-binding sites. Superimposed on the needle-in-the-haystack problem is the complex nature of the cellular environment, which contains such high concentrations of macromolecules that the time frame for diffusion is expected to be severely extended as compared to dilute solution. Here we critically review the mechanisms for how these proteins solve the needle-in-the-haystack problem and how the effects of cellular macromolecular crowding can enhance facilitated diffusion processes. We restrict the review to human proteins that use stochastic, thermally driven site-recognition mechanisms, and we specifically exclude systems involving energy cofactors or circular DNA clamps. Our scope includes ensemble and single-molecule studies of the past decade or so, with an emphasis on connecting experimental observations to biological function.","933":"Computational chemistry provides a versatile toolbox for studying mechanistic details of catalytic reactions and holds promise to deliver practical strategies to enable the rational in silico catalyst design. The versatile reactivity and nontrivial electronic structure effects, common for systems based on 3d transition metals, introduce additional complexity that may represent a particular challenge to the standard computational strategies. In this review, we discuss the challenges and capabilities of modern electronic structure methods for studying the reaction mechanisms promoted by 3d transition metal molecular catalysts. Particular focus will be placed on the ways of addressing the multiconfigurational problem in electronic structure calculations and the role of expert bias in the practical utilization of the available methods. The development of density functionals designed to address transition metals is also discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the methods that account for solvation effects and the multicomponent nature of practical catalytic systems. This is followed by an overview of recent computational studies addressing the mechanistic complexity of catalytic processes by molecular catalysts based on 3d metals. Cases that involve noninnocent ligands, multicomponent reaction systems, metal-ligand and metal-metal cooperativity, as well as modeling complex catalytic systems such as metal-organic frameworks are presented. Conventionally, computational studies on catalytic mechanisms are heavily dependent on the chemical intuition and expert input of the researcher. Recent developments in advanced automated methods for reaction path analysis hold promise for eliminating such human-bias from computational catalysis studies. A brief overview of these approaches is presented in the final section of the review. The paper is closed with general concluding remarks.","934":"Heme-copper oxidases (HCOs) are terminal enzymes on the mitochondrial or bacterial respiratory electron transport chain, which utilize a unique heterobinuclear active site to catalyze the 4H+\/4e- reduction of dioxygen to water. This process involves a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from a tyrosine (phenolic) residue and additional redox events coupled to transmembrane proton pumping and ATP synthesis. Given that HCOs are large, complex, membrane-bound enzymes, bioinspired synthetic model chemistry is a promising approach to better understand heme-Cu-mediated dioxygen reduction, including the details of proton and electron movements. This review encompasses important aspects of heme-O2 and copper-O2 (bio)chemistries as they relate to the design and interpretation of small molecule model systems and provides perspectives from fundamental coordination chemistry, which can be applied to the understanding of HCO activity. We focus on recent advancements from studies of heme-Cu models, evaluating experimental and computational results, which highlight important fundamental structure-function relationships. Finally, we provide an outlook for future potential contributions from synthetic inorganic chemistry and discuss their implications with relevance to biological O2-reduction.","935":"One of the recently emerging topics in biotechnology is natural receptors including G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, enzyme-linked receptors, and intracellular receptors, due to their molecular specificity. These receptors, other than intracellular receptors, which are membrane proteins expressed on the cell membrane, can detect extracellular stimuli. Many researchers have utilized cells with natural receptors embedded in the cellular membrane for human sense-mimicking platforms based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalances, surface plasmon resonance, and surface acoustic waves. In addition, integration of conducting nanomaterials and natural receptors allows highly sensitive and selective responses toward target molecules, enabling, for example, nanobioelectronic noses for odorants, nanobioelectronic tongues for tastants, and G-protein-coupled receptor sensors for hormones, dopamine, cadaverine, geosmin, trimethylamine, etc. Moreover, as a part of nanobioelectronic sensors, natural receptors can be produced in various forms, such as peptides, proteins, nanovesicles, and nanodiscs, and each sensor can provide an ultralow limit of detection. In this Review, we discuss biosensors with natural receptors and then especially focus on natural receptor-conjugated conducting nanomaterial sensors. To provide a fundamental understanding, the sections encompass (1) the fabrication of conducting nanomaterials, (2) the production of natural receptors, (3) the characteristics of natural receptors, (4) the technology for immobilizing both components, and (5) their sensing applications. Finally, perspective is given on a new development in the use of natural receptors in a wide range of industries, such as food, cosmetics, and healthcare. In addition, artificial olfactory codes will be characterized by signal processing in the near future, leading to human olfactory standardization.","936":"Metallo-oxide (MO)-based bioinorganic nanocomposites promise unique structures, physicochemical properties, and novel biochemical functionalities, and within the past decade, investment in research on materials such as ZnO, TiO2, SiO2, and GeO2 has significantly increased. Besides traditional approaches, the synthesis, shaping, structural patterning, and postprocessing chemical functionalization of the materials surface is inspired by strategies which mimic processes in nature. Would such materials deliver new technologies? Answering this question requires the merging of historical knowledge and current research from different fields of science. Practically, we need an effective defragmentation of the research area. From our perspective, the superficial accounting of material properties, chemistry of the surfaces, and the behavior of biomolecules next to such surfaces is a problem. This is particularly of concern when we wish to bridge between technologies in vitro and biotechnologies in vivo. Further, besides the potential practical technological efficiency and advantages such materials might exhibit, we have to consider the wider long-term implications of material stability and toxicity. In this contribution, we present a critical review of recent advances in the chemistry and engineering of MO-based biocomposites, highlighting the role of interactions at the interface and the techniques by which these can be studied. At the end of the article, we outline the challenges which hamper progress in research and extrapolate to developing and promising directions including additive manufacturing and synthetic biology that could benefit from molecular level understanding of interactions occurring between inanimate (abiotic) and living (biotic) materials.","937":"Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural stand out as bridges connecting biomass raw materials to the biorefinery industry. Their reductive transformations by hydroconversion are key routes toward a wide variety of chemicals and biofuels, and heterogeneous catalysis plays a central role in these reactions. The catalyst efficiency highly depends on the nature of metals, supports, and additives, on the catalyst preparation procedure, and obviously on reaction conditions to which catalyst and reactants are exposed: solvent, pressure, and temperature. The present review focuses on the roles played by the catalyst at the molecular level in the hydroconversion of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in the gas or liquid phases, including catalytic hydrogen transfer routes and electro\/photoreduction, into oxygenates or hydrocarbons (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan, cyclopentanone, 1,5-pentanediol, 2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, furan, furfuryl ethers, etc.). The mechanism of adsorption of the reactant and the mechanism of the reaction of hydroconversion are correlated to the specificities of each active metal, both noble (Pt, Pd, Ru, Au, Rh, and Ir) and non-noble (Ni, Cu, Co, Mo, and Fe), with an emphasis on the role of the support and of additives on catalytic performances (conversion, yield, and stability). The reusability of catalytic systems (deactivation mechanism, protection, and regeneration methods) is also discussed.","938":"Lipid membranes can spontaneously organize their components into domains of different sizes and properties. The organization of membrane lipids into nanodomains might potentially play a role in vital functions of cells and organisms. Model membranes represent attractive systems to study lipid nanodomains, which cannot be directly addressed in living cells with the currently available methods. This review summarizes the knowledge on lipid nanodomains in model membranes and exposes how their specific character contrasts with large-scale phase separation. The overview on lipid nanodomains in membranes composed of diverse lipids (e.g., zwitterionic and anionic glycerophospholipids, ceramides, glycosphingolipids) and cholesterol aims to evidence the impact of chemical, electrostatic, and geometric properties of lipids on nanodomain formation. Furthermore, the effects of curvature, asymmetry, and ions on membrane nanodomains are shown to be highly relevant aspects that may also modulate lipid nanodomains in cellular membranes. Potential mechanisms responsible for the formation and dynamics of nanodomains are discussed with support from available theories and computational studies. A brief description of current fluorescence techniques and analytical tools that enabled progress in lipid nanodomain studies is also included. Further directions are proposed to successfully extend this research to cells.","939":"Significant computational efforts have been focused toward exposing the molecular mechanisms of anesthesia in recent years. In the past decade, this has been aided considerably by a momentous increase in the number of high-resolution structures of ion channels, which are putative targets for the anesthetic agents, as well as advancements in high-performance computing technologies. In this review, typical simulation methods to investigate the behavior of model membranes and membrane-protein systems are briefly reviewed, and related computational studies are surveyed. Both lipid- and protein-mediated mechanisms of anesthetic action are scrutinized, focusing on the behavior of ion channels in the latter case.","940":"Tens of millions of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams are performed annually around the world. The contrast agents, which improve diagnostic accuracy, are almost exclusively small, hydrophilic gadolinium(III) based chelates. In recent years concerns have arisen surrounding the long-term safety of these compounds, and this has spurred research into alternatives. There has also been a push to develop new molecularly targeted contrast agents or agents that can sense pathological changes in the local environment. This comprehensive review describes the state of the art of clinically approved contrast agents, their mechanism of action, and factors influencing their safety. From there we describe different mechanisms of generating MR image contrast such as relaxation, chemical exchange saturation transfer, and direct detection and the types of molecules that are effective for these purposes. Next we describe efforts to make safer contrast agents either by increasing relaxivity, increasing resistance to metal ion release, or by moving to gadolinium(III)-free alternatives. Finally we survey approaches to make contrast agents more specific for pathology either by direct biochemical targeting or by the design of responsive or activatable contrast agents.","941":"Shikimic acid is a natural product of industrial importance utilized as a precursor of the antiviral Tamiflu. It is nowadays produced in multihundred ton amounts from the extraction of star anise ( Illicium verum) or by fermentation processes. Apart from the production of Tamiflu, shikimic acid has gathered particular notoriety as its useful carbon backbone and inherent chirality provide extensive use as a versatile chiral precursor in organic synthesis. This review provides an overview of the main synthetic and microbial methods for production of shikimic acid and highlights selected methods for isolation from available plant sources. Furthermore, we have attempted to demonstrate the synthetic utility of shikimic acid by covering the most important synthetic modifications and related applications, namely, synthesis of Tamiflu and derivatives, synthetic manipulations of the main functional groups, and its use as biorenewable material and in total synthesis. Given its rich chemistry and availability, shikimic acid is undoubtedly a promising platform molecule for further exploration. Therefore, in the end, we outline some challenges and promising future directions.","942":"The development of new or more sustainable, active, efficient, controlled, and selective polymerization reactions or processes continues to be crucial for the synthesis of important polymers or materials with specific structures or functions. In this context, the newly emerged polymerization technique enabled by main-group Lewis pairs (LPs), termed as Lewis pair polymerization (LPP), exploits the synergy and cooperativity between the Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites of LPs, which can be employed as frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), interacting LPs (ILPs), or classical Lewis adducts (CLAs), to effect cooperative monomer activation as well as chain initiation, propagation, termination, and transfer events. Through balancing the Lewis acidity, Lewis basicity, and steric effects of LPs, LPP has shown several unique advantages or intriguing opportunities compared to other polymerization techniques and demonstrated its broad polar monomer scope, high activity, control or livingness, and complete chemo- or regioselectivity, as well as its unique application in materials chemistry. These advances made in LPP are comprehensively reviewed, with the scope of monomers focusing on heteroatom-containing polar monomers, while the polymerizations mediated by main-group LAs and LBs separately that are most relevant to the LPP are also highlighted or updated. Examples of applying the principles of the LPP and LP chemistry as a new platform for advancing materials chemistry are highlighted, and currently unmet challenges in the field of the LPP, and thus the suggested corresponding future research directions, are also presented.","943":"Noble metal nanoparticles have been extensively studied to understand and apply their plasmonic responses, upon coupling with electromagnetic radiation, to research areas such as sensing, photocatalysis, electronics, and biomedicine. The plasmonic properties of metal nanoparticles can change significantly with changes in particle size, shape, composition, and arrangement. Thus, stabilization of the fabricated nanoparticles is crucial for preservation of the desired plasmonic behavior. Because plasmonic nanoparticles find application in diverse fields, a variety of different stabilization strategies have been developed. Often, stabilizers also function to enhance or improve the plasmonic properties of the nanoparticles. This review provides a representative overview of how gold and silver nanoparticles, the most frequently used materials in current plasmonic applications, are stabilized in different application platforms and how the stabilizing agents improve their plasmonic properties at the same time. Specifically, this review focuses on the roles and effects of stabilizing agents such as surfactants, silica, biomolecules, polymers, and metal shells in colloidal nanoparticle suspensions. Stability strategies for other types of plasmonic nanomaterials, lithographic plasmonic nanoparticle arrays, are discussed as well.","944":"Transition state theory teaches that chemically stable mimics of enzymatic transition states will bind tightly to their cognate enzymes. Kinetic isotope effects combined with computational quantum chemistry provides enzymatic transition state information with sufficient fidelity to design transition state analogues.

Particular attention is paid to both foundational studies and recent advances over the past decade involving semistabilized and nonstabilized 2-azaallyl anions as key intermediates in various carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming processes. Both transition-metal-catalyzed and transition-metal-free transformations are covered. Azomethine ylides, which have received significant attention elsewhere, are discussed briefly with the primary focus on critical comparisons with 2-azaallyl anions in regard to generation and use.","946":"","947":null,"948":"The success of platinum-based anticancer agents has motivated the exploration of novel metal-based drugs for several decades, whereas problems such as drug-resistance and systemic toxicity hampered their clinical applications and efficacy. Stimuli-responsiveness of some metal complexes offers a good opportunity for designing site-specific prodrugs to maximize the therapeutic efficacy and minimize the side effect of metallodrugs. This review presents a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on the therapeutic stimuli-responsive metallodrugs that have appeared in the past two decades, where stimuli such as redox, pH, enzyme, light, temperature, and so forth were involved. The compounds are classified into three major categories based on the nature of stimuli, that is, endo-stimuli-responsive metallodrugs, exo-stimuli-responsive metallodrugs, and dual-stimuli-responsive metallodrugs. Representative examples of each type are discussed in terms of structure, response mechanism, and potential medical applications. In the end, future opportunities and challenges in this field are tentatively proposed. With diverse metal complexes being introduced, the foci of this review are pointed to platinum and ruthenium complexes.","949":"The chemistry of vanadium has seen remarkable activity in the past 50 years. In the present review, reactions catalyzed by homogeneous and supported vanadium complexes from 2008 to 2018 are summarized and discussed. Particular attention is given to mechanistic and kinetics studies of vanadium-catalyzed reactions including oxidations of alkanes, alkenes, arenes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and sulfur species, as well as oxidative C-C and C-O bond cleavage, carbon-carbon bond formation, deoxydehydration, haloperoxidase, cyanation, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, ring-opening metathesis polymerization, and oxo\/imido heterometathesis. Additionally, insights into heterogeneous vanadium catalysis are provided when parallels can be drawn from the homogeneous literature.","950":"Transition metal complexes are of increasing interest as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and, more recently, for photochemotherapy (PCT). In recent years, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have emerged as promising systems for both PDT and PCT. Their rich photochemical and photophysical properties derive from a variety of excited-state electronic configurations accessible with visible and near-infrared light, and these properties can be exploited for both energy- and electron-transfer processes that can yield highly potent oxygen-dependent and\/or oxygen-independent photobiological activity. Selected examples highlight the use of rational design in coordination chemistry to control the lowest-energy triplet excited-state configurations for eliciting a particular type of photoreactivity for PDT and\/or PCT effects. These principles are also discussed in the context of the development of TLD1433, the first Ru(II)-based photosensitizer for PDT to enter a human clinical trial. The design of TLD1433 arose from a tumor-centered approach, as part of a complete PDT package that includes the light component and the protocol for treating non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Briefly, this review summarizes the challenges to bringing PDT into mainstream cancer therapy. It considers the chemical and photophysical solutions that transition metal complexes offer, and it puts into context the multidisciplinary effort needed to bring a new drug to clinical trial.","951":"Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) methods have been routinely used for the characterization of both the structure and the dynamics of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), a collection of porous media investigated for potential applications in carbon capture technologies, selective separation of small molecules, and catalysis. (1) The use and development of SSNMR techniques that enable the nondestructive characterization of the adsorbed behavior have become essential steps in bettering our understanding of MOFs and are often complementary to traditional methods of structural characterization. This Review aims to give a brief introduction to the relevant concepts of SSNMR and the methods employed when investigating the phenomenon of adsorbed carbon dioxide gas in MOFs. We summarize the published SSNMR literature on CO2 in MOFs, as well as highlight the best experimental practices when working with these complex systems.","952":"Biomolecular assembly is a key driving force in nearly all life processes, providing structure, information storage, and communication within cells and at the whole organism level. These assembly processes rely on precise interactions between functional groups on nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and small molecules, and can be fine-tuned to span a range of time, length, and complexity scales. Recognizing the power of these motifs, researchers have sought to emulate and engineer biomolecular assemblies in the laboratory, with goals ranging from modulating cellular function to the creation of new polymeric materials. In most cases, engineering efforts are inspired or informed by understanding the structure and properties of naturally occurring assemblies, which has in turn fueled the development of predictive models that enable computational design of novel assemblies. This Review will focus on selected examples of protein assemblies, highlighting the story arc from initial discovery of an assembly, through initial engineering attempts, toward the ultimate goal of predictive design. The aim of this Review is to highlight areas where significant progress has been made, as well as to outline remaining challenges, as solving these challenges will be the key that unlocks the full power of biomolecules for advances in technology and medicine.","953":"Knowledge and foundational understanding of phenomena associated with the behavior of materials at the nanoscale is one of the key scientific challenges toward a sustainable energy future. Size reduction from bulk to the nanoscale leads to a variety of exciting and anomalous phenomena due to enhanced surface-to-volume ratio, reduced transport length, and tunable nanointerfaces. Nanostructured metal hydrides are an important class of materials with significant potential for energy storage applications. Hydrogen storage in nanoscale metal hydrides has been recognized as a potentially transformative technology, and the field is now growing steadily due to the ability to tune the material properties more independently and drastically compared to those of their bulk counterparts. The numerous advantages of nanostructured metal hydrides compared to bulk include improved reversibility, altered heats of hydrogen absorption\/desorption, nanointerfacial reaction pathways with faster rates, and new surface states capable of activating chemical bonds. This review aims to summarize the progress to date in the area of nanostructured metal hydrides and intends to understand and explain the underpinnings of the innovative concepts and strategies developed over the past decade to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen storage reactions. These recent achievements have the potential to propel further the prospects of tuning the hydride properties at nanoscale, with several promising directions and strategies that could lead to the next generation of solid-state materials for hydrogen storage applications.","954":"We review the standard model for de novo computational design of enzymes, which primarily focuses on the development of an active-site geometry, composed of protein functional groups in orientations optimized to stabilize the transition state, for a novel chemical reaction not found in nature. Its emphasis is placed on the structure and energetics of the active site embedded in an accommodating protein that serves as a physical support that shields the reaction chemistry from solvent, which is typically improved upon by laboratory-directed evolution. We also provide a review of design strategies that move beyond the standard model, by placing more emphasis on the designed enzyme as a whole catalytic construct. Starting with complete de novo enzyme design examples, we consider additional design factors such as entropy of individual residues, correlated motion between side chains (mutual information), dynamical correlations of the enzyme motions that could aid the reaction, reorganization energy, and electric fields as ways to exploit the entire protein scaffold to improve upon the catalytic rate, thereby providing directed evolution with better starting sequences for increasing biocatalytic performance.","955":null,"956":null,"957":"Electrochemical biosensors and associated lab-on-a-chip devices are the analytical system of choice when rapid and on-site results are needed in medical diagnostics and food safety, for environmental protection, process control, wastewater treatment, and life sciences discovery research among many others. A premier example is the glucose sensor used by diabetic patients. Current research focuses on developing sensors for specific analytes in these application fields and addresses challenges that need to be solved before viable commercial products can be designed. These challenges typically include the lowering of the limit of detection, the integration of sample preparation into the device and hence analysis directly within a sample matrix, finding strategies for long-term in vivo use, etc. Today, functional nanomaterials are synthesized, investigated, and applied in electrochemical biosensors and lab-on-a-chip devices to assist in this endeavor. This review answers many questions around the nanomaterials used, their inherent properties and the chemistries they offer that are of interest to the analytical systems, and their roles in analytical applications in the past 5 years (2013-2018), and it gives a quantitative assessment of their positive effects on the analyses. Furthermore, to facilitate an insightful understanding on how functional nanomaterials can be beneficial and effectively implemented into electrochemical biosensor-based lab-on-a-chip devices, seminal studies discussing important fundamental knowledge regarding device fabrication and nanomaterials are comprehensively included here. The review ultimately gives answers to the ultimate question: \"Are they really needed or can bulk materials accomplish the same?\" Finally, challenges and future directions are also discussed.","958":"Plasmonic biosensing has been used for fast, real-time, and label-free probing of biologically relevant analytes, where the main challenges are to detect small molecules at ultralow concentrations and produce compact devices for point-of-care (PoC) analysis. This review discusses the most recent, or even emerging, trends in plasmonic biosensing, with novel platforms which exploit unique physicochemical properties and versatility of new materials. In addition to the well-established use of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), three major areas have been identified in these new trends: chiral plasmonics, magnetoplasmonics, and quantum plasmonics. In describing the recent advances, emphasis is placed on the design and manufacture of portable devices working with low loss in different frequency ranges, from the infrared to the visible.","959":"Molecularly imprinted polymers are synthetic receptors for a targeted molecule. As such, they are analogues of the natural antibody-antigen systems. In this review, after a recounting of the early history of the general field, we specifically focus on the application of these polymers as sensors. In these applications, the polymers are paired with a reporting system, which may be electrical, electrochemical, optical, or gravimetric. The presence of the targeted molecule effects a change in the reporting agent, and a calibrated quantity of the target is recorded. In this review, we describe the imprinted polymer production processes, the techniques used for reporting, and the applications of the reported sensors. A brief survey of recent applications to gas-phase sensing is included, but the focus is primarily on the development of sensors for targets in solution. Included among the applications are those designed to detect toxic chemicals, toxins in foods, drugs, explosives, and pathogens. The application of computational chemistry to the development of new imprinted polymers is included as is a brief assessment of future developments.","960":"Accurate and precise drug delivery is the key to successful therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, which can transport therapeutic payload to cells expressing specific markers, have paved the way for targeted drug delivery and currently show tremendous clinical success. However, in those abundant cases, when a disease cannot be characterized by a single specific marker, more sophisticated drug delivery systems are required. To enhance targeting accuracy, diverse smart materials have been proposed that can also react to stimuli like variations of pH, temperature, magnetic field, etc. Furthermore, over the past few years a new category of smart materials has emerged, which can not only respond to virtually any biochemical or physical stimulus but also simultaneously analyze several cues and, moreover, can be programmed to use Boolean logic for such analysis. These advanced biocomputing agents have the potential to become a basis for future nanorobotic devices that could overcome some of the grand challenges of modern biomedicine. Here, with a brief introduction to the multidisciplinary field of biomolecular computing, we will review the concepts of nanomaterials with built-in biocomputing capabilities, which can be potentially used for drug delivery and other theranostic applications.","961":"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) promise to advance a number of real-world technologies. Of these applications, they are particularly attractive for uses in chemical sensors for environmental and health monitoring. However, chemical sensors based on CNTs are often lacking in selectivity, and the elucidation of their sensing mechanisms remains challenging. This review is a comprehensive description of the parameters that give rise to the sensing capabilities of CNT-based sensors and the application of CNT-based devices in chemical sensing. This review begins with the discussion of the sensing mechanisms in CNT-based devices, the chemical methods of CNT functionalization, architectures of sensors, performance parameters, and theoretical models used to describe CNT sensors. It then discusses the expansive applications of CNT-based sensors to multiple areas including environmental monitoring, food and agriculture applications, biological sensors, and national security. The discussion of each analyte focuses on the strategies used to impart selectivity and the molecular interactions between the selector and the analyte. Finally, the review concludes with a brief outlook over future developments in the field of chemical sensors and their prospects for commercialization.","962":"The past decade has witnessed an explosion in the use of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods in biology and other fields. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is one of the most widespread of these methods and owes its success in large part to the ability to control the on-off state of fluorophores through various chemical, photochemical, or binding-unbinding mechanisms. We provide here a comprehensive overview of switchable fluorophores in SMLM including a detailed review of all major classes of SMLM fluorophores, and we also address strategies for labeling specimens, considerations for multichannel and live-cell imaging, potential pitfalls, and areas for future development.","963":"A comprehensive review on the development and state of the art of colorimetric and fluorometric sensor arrays is presented. Chemical sensing aims to detect subtle changes in the chemical environment by transforming relevant chemical or physical properties of molecular or ionic species (i.e., analytes) into an analytically useful output. Optical arrays based on chemoresponsive colorants (dyes and nanoporous pigments) probe the chemical reactivity of analytes, rather than their physical properties (e.g., mass). The chemical specificity of the olfactory system does not come from specific receptors for specific analytes (e.g., the traditional lock-and-key model of substrate-enzyme interactions), but rather olfaction makes use of pattern recognition of the combined response of several hundred olfactory receptors. In a similar fashion, arrays of chemoresponsive colorants provide high-dimensional data from the color or fluorescence changes of the dyes in these arrays as they are exposed to analytes. This provides chemical sensing with high sensitivity (often down to parts per billion levels), impressive discrimination among very similar analytes, and exquisite fingerprinting of extremely similar mixtures over a wide range of analyte types, in both the gas and liquid phases. Design of both sensor arrays and instrumentation for their analysis are discussed. In addition, the various chemometric and statistical analyses of high-dimensional data (including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVMs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs)) are presented and critiqued in reference to their use in chemical sensing. A variety of applications are also discussed, including personal dosimetry of toxic industrial chemical, detection of explosives or accelerants, quality control of foods and beverages, biosensing intracellularly, identification of bacteria and fungi, and detection of cancer and disease biomarkers.","964":"Graphene, in its ideal form, is a two-dimensional (2D) material consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The richness in morphological, physical, mechanical, and optical properties of ideal graphene has stimulated enormous scientific and industrial interest, since its first exfoliation in 2004. In turn, the production of graphene in a reliable, controllable, and scalable manner has become significantly important to bring us closer to practical applications of graphene. To this end, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers tantalizing opportunities for the synthesis of large-area, uniform, and high-quality graphene films. However, quite different from the ideal 2D structure of graphene, in reality, the currently available CVD-grown graphene films are still suffering from intrinsic defective grain boundaries, surface contaminations, and wrinkles, together with low growth rate and the requirement of inevitable transfer. Clearly, a gap still exits between the reality of CVD-derived graphene, especially in industrial production, and ideal graphene with outstanding properties. This Review will emphasize the recent advances and strategies in CVD production of graphene for settling these issues to bridge the giant gap. We begin with brief background information about the synthesis of nanoscale carbon allotropes, followed by the discussion of fundamental growth mechanism and kinetics of CVD growth of graphene. We then discuss the strategies for perfecting the quality of CVD-derived graphene with regard to domain size, cleanness, flatness, growth rate, scalability, and direct growth of graphene on functional substrate. Finally, a perspective on future development in the research relevant to scalable growth of high-quality graphene is presented.","965":"","966":"The extracellular matrix (ECM) constitutes a highly dynamic three-dimensional structural network comprised of macromolecules, such as proteoglycans\/glycosaminoglycans (PGs\/GAGs), collagens, laminins, fibronectin, elastin, other glycoproteins and proteinases. In recent years, the field of PGs has expanded rapidly. Due to their high structural complexity and heterogeneity, PGs mediate several homeostatic and pathological processes. PGs consist of a protein core and one or more covalently attached GAG chains, which provide the protein cores with the ability to interact with several proteins. The GAG building blocks of PGs significantly influence the chemical and functional properties of PGs. The primary goal of this comprehensive review is to summarize major achievements and paradigm-shifting discoveries made on the PG\/GAG chemistry-biology axis, focusing on structural variability, structure-function relationships, metabolic, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying their synthesis. Recent insights related to exosome biogenesis, degradation, and cell signaling, their status as diagnostic tools and potential pharmacological targets in diseases as well as current applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology are addressed. Moreover, issues related to docking studies, molecular modeling, GAG\/PG interaction networks, and their integration are discussed.","967":"Ongoing technological advances in diverse fields including portable electronics, transportation, and green energy are often hindered by the insufficient capability of energy-storage devices. By taking advantage of two different electrode materials, asymmetric supercapacitors can extend their operating voltage window beyond the thermodynamic decomposition voltage of electrolytes while enabling a solution to the energy storage limitations of symmetric supercapacitors. This review provides comprehensive knowledge to this field. We first look at the essential energy-storage mechanisms and performance evaluation criteria for asymmetric supercapacitors to understand the wide-ranging research conducted in this area. Then we move to the recent progress made for the design and fabrication of electrode materials and the overall structure of asymmetric supercapacitors in different categories. We also highlight several key scientific challenges and present our perspectives on enhancing the electrochemical performance of future asymmetric supercapacitors.","968":"Asymmetric phosphine catalysis showcasing remarkable progress over the past two decades has emerged as a key synthetic platform for the creation of molecular frameworks encountered in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Different types of novel chiral phosphine catalysts have been developed and employed in cornucopias of organic transformations, such as annulation, addition, Morita-Baylis-Hillman, and Rauhut-Currier reactions, among others.

The role of metalloenzymes in these processes also makes them central for the progression of many diseases and, as such, makes metalloenzymes attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Increasing awareness of the role metalloenzymes play in disease and their importance as a class of targets has amplified interest in the development of new strategies to develop inhibitors and ultimately useful drugs. In this Review, we provide a broad overview of several drug discovery efforts focused on metalloenzymes and attempt to map out the current landscape of high-value metalloenzyme targets.","970":"The indolocarbazoles are an important class of nitrogen heterocycles which has evolved significantly in recent years, with numerous studies focusing on their diverse biological effects, or targeting new materials with potential applications in organic electronics.

The literature of the past decade forms the basis of the text, which is further supplemented with older key references.","971":"In addition to the appealing synthetic transformations that cyclopropanes present, they are also part of larger molecular structures that possess a wide range of biological properties. Therefore, the preparation of enantiomerically enriched cyclopropanes has consistently been a very interesting research topic in organic synthesis. In this Focus Review, we are presenting new methods for the synthesis of these target compounds through catalytic and asymmetric direct functionalization of simple achiral three-membered carbocycle precursors. These convergent and very flexible approaches allow the preparation of a large variety of polysubstituted alkyl-, vinyl-, alkynyl-, and arylcyclopropanes but also cyclopropanols and cyclopropylamines in very high diastereo- and enantiomeric ratios from a single precursor, underlining the power of this synthetic route.","972":"The plasma membrane is of central importance for defining the closed volume of cells in contradistinction to the extracellular environment. The plasma membrane not only serves as a boundary, but it also mediates the exchange of physical and chemical information between the cell and its environment in order to maintain intra- and intercellular functions. Artificial lipid- and cell-derived membrane vesicles have been used as closed-volume containers, representing the simplest cell model systems to study transmembrane processes and intracellular biochemistry. Classical examples are studies of membrane translocation processes in plasma membrane vesicles and proteoliposomes mediated by transport proteins and ion channels. Liposomes and native membrane vesicles are widely used as model membranes for investigating the binding and bilayer insertion of proteins, the structure and function of membrane proteins, the intramembrane composition and distribution of lipids and proteins, and the intermembrane interactions during exo- and endocytosis. In addition, natural cell-released microvesicles have gained importance for early detection of diseases and for their use as nanoreactors and minimal protocells. Yet, in most studies, ensembles of vesicles have been employed. More recently, new micro- and nanotechnological tools as well as novel developments in both optical and electron microscopy have allowed the isolation and investigation of individual (sub)micrometer-sized vesicles. Such single-vesicle experiments have revealed large heterogeneities in the structure and function of membrane components of single vesicles, which were hidden in ensemble studies. These results have opened enormous possibilities for bioanalysis and biotechnological applications involving unprecedented miniaturization at the nanometer and attoliter range. This review will cover important developments toward single-vesicle analysis and the central discoveries made in this exciting field of research.","973":"Proteins are involved in many biological processes. Misfolded, truncated, or mutated proteins as well as over- or underexpressed proteins have been implicated in many diseases. Therefore, detection and quantification of proteins is extremely important. Conventional techniques such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western Blot, and mass spectrometry have enabled discovery and study of proteins in biological samples. However, many important proteins are present at low concentrations, rendering them undetectable using conventional techniques. Furthermore, limited ability to simultaneously measure multiple proteins in a sample has constrained our ability to fully study the proteome. In this review, we comprehensively discuss approaches for protein detection. We first discuss the fundamentals of proteins and protein assays, including affinity reagents, surface functionalization, assay formats, signal detection, and multiplexing. We then discuss the challenges with these methods and review existing methods for highly sensitive and multiplexed protein detection. Finally, we review recent advances in protein detection from the literature and discuss challenges and future directions.","974":"There has been uninterrupted interest in supercooled water ever since the pioneering experiments of Speedy and Angell revealed sharp increases in this substance's response functions upon supercooling. One intriguing hypothesis that was formulated to explain this behavior involves the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid transition (LLT) at deeply supercooled conditions. The preponderance of experimental evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, although no definitive proof exists to date. Computational studies have played an important role in this area, because ice nucleation can in principle be controlled in silico. It has been claimed, controversially, that the LLT is a misinterpreted liquid-solid transition in all models of water. Recent studies disprove this viewpoint by providing unambiguous counter-examples of distinct liquid-liquid and liquid-crystal transitions in tetrahedral models. In one, state-of-the-art sampling methods were used to compute the free energy surface of a molecular model of water and revealed the existence of two liquid phases in metastable equilibrium with each other and a stable crystal phase, at the same, deeply supercooled thermodynamic conditions. Further studies showed that, by tuning the potential parameters of a model tetrahedral system, it is possible to make the LLT evolve continuously from metastability to being thermodynamically stable with respect to crystallization. Most recently, it has been shown that the simulation code used to challenge the hypothesis of an LLT contains conceptual errors that invalidate the results on which the challenge was based, definitively resolving the controversy. The debate has vastly expanded the range of fundamental questions being pursued about phase transitions in metastable systems and ushered the use of increasingly sophisticated computational methods to explore the possible existence of LLTs in model systems.","975":"The concept of cell signaling in the context of nonenzyme-assisted protein modifications by reactive electrophilic and oxidative species, broadly known as redox signaling, is a uniquely complex topic that has been approached from numerous different and multidisciplinary angles. Our Review reflects on five aspects critical for understanding how nature harnesses these noncanonical post-translational modifications to coordinate distinct cellular activities: (1) specific players and their generation, (2) physicochemical properties, (3) mechanisms of action, (4) methods of interrogation, and (5) functional roles in health and disease. Emphasis is primarily placed on the latest progress in the field, but several aspects of classical work likely forgotten\/lost are also recollected. For researchers with interests in getting into the field, our Review is anticipated to function as a primer. For the expert, we aim to stimulate thought and discussion about fundamentals of redox signaling mechanisms and nuances of specificity\/selectivity and timing in this sophisticated yet fascinating arena at the crossroads of chemistry and biology.","976":null,"977":"Monomers possessing two functionalities suitable for polymerization are often designed and utilized in syntheses directed to the formation of cross-linked macromolecules. In this review, we give an account of recent developments related to the use of such monomers in cyclopolymerization processes, in order to form linear, soluble macromolecules. These processes can be activated by means of radical, ionic, or transition-metal mediated chain-growth polymerization mechanisms, to achieve cyclic moieties of variable ring size which are embedded within the polymer backbone, driving and tuning peculiar physical properties of the resulting macromolecules. The two functionalities are covalently linked by a \"tether\", which can be appropriately designed in order to \"imprint\" elements of chemical information into the polymer backbone during the synthesis and, in some cases, be removed by postpolymerization reactions. The two functionalities can possess identical or even very different reactivities toward the polymerization mechanism involved; in the latter case, consequences and outcomes related to the sequence-controlled, precision synthesis of macromolecules have been demonstrated. Recent advances in new initiating systems and polymerization catalysts enabled the precision syntheses of polymers with regulated cyclic structures by highly regio- and\/or stereoselective cyclopolymerization. Cyclopolymerizations involving double cyclization, ring-opening, or isomerization have been also developed, generating unique repeating structures, which can hardly be obtained by conventional polymerization methods.","978":"Glycosylation is one of the most prevalent posttranslational modifications that profoundly affects the structure and functions of proteins in a wide variety of biological recognition events. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of glycoproteins, usually resulting from the variations of glycan components and\/or the sites of glycosylation, often complicates detailed structure-function relationship studies and hampers the therapeutic applications of glycoproteins. To address these challenges, various chemical and biological strategies have been developed for producing glycan-defined homogeneous glycoproteins. This review highlights recent advances in the development of chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing homogeneous glycoproteins, including the generation of various glycosynthases for synthetic purposes, endoglycosidase-catalyzed glycoprotein synthesis and glycan remodeling, and direct enzymatic glycosylation of polypeptides and proteins. The scope, limitation, and future directions of each method are discussed.","979":"Biogas is an increasingly attractive renewable resource, envisioned to secure future energy demands and help curb global climate change. To capitalize on this resource, membrane processes and state-of-the-art membranes must efficiently recover methane (CH4) from biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2). Composite (a.k.a. mixed-matrix) membranes, prepared from common polymers and rationally selected\/engineered fillers, are highly promising for this application. This review comprehensively examines filler materials that are capable of enhancing the CO2\/CH4 separation performance of polymeric membranes. Specifically, we highlight novel synthetic strategies for engineering filler materials to develop high-performance composite membranes. Besides, as the matrix components (polymers) of composite membranes largely dictate the overall gas separation performances, we introduce a new empirical metric, the \"Filler Enhancement Index\" ( Findex), to aid researchers in assessing the effectiveness of the fillers from a big data perspective. The Findex systematically decouples the effect of polymer matrices and critically evaluates both conventional and emerging fillers to map out a future direction for next-generation (bio)gas separation membranes. Beyond biogas separation, this review is of relevance to a broader community with interests in composite membranes for other gas separation processes, as well as water treatment applications.","980":"Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of electrode materials, electrolytes, and separators of energy-storage devices to address the fundamental needs of emerging technologies such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. However, binders, as an important component of energy-storage devices, are yet to receive similar attention. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been the dominant binder in the battery industry for decades despite several well-recognized drawbacks, i.e., limited binding strength due to the lack of chemical bonds with electroactive materials, insufficient mechanical properties, and low electronic and lithium-ion conductivities. The limited binding function cannot meet inherent demands of emerging electrode materials with high capacities such as silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes. To address these concerns, in this review we divide the binding between active materials and binders into two major mechanisms: mechanical interlocking and interfacial binding forces. We review existing and emerging binders, binding technology used in energy-storage devices (including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors), and state-of-the-art mechanical characterization and computational methods for binder research. Finally, we propose prospective next-generation binders for energy-storage devices from the molecular level to the macro level. Functional binders will play crucial roles in future high-performance energy-storage devices.","981":"Enzymes catalyze a vast range of reactions. Their catalytic performances, mechanisms, global folds, and active-site architectures are also highly diverse, suggesting that enzymes are shaped by an entire range of physiological demands and evolutionary constraints, as well as by chemical and physicochemical constraints. We have attempted to identify signatures of these shaping demands and constraints. To this end, we describe a bird's-eye view of the enzyme space from two angles: evolution and chemistry. We examine various chemical reaction parameters that may have shaped the catalytic performances and active-site architectures of enzymes. We test and weigh these considerations against physiological and evolutionary factors. Although the catalytic properties of the \"average\" enzyme correlate with cellular metabolic demands and enzyme expression levels, at the level of individual enzymes, a multitude of physiological demands and constraints, combined with the coincidental nature of evolutionary processes, result in a complex picture. Indeed, neither reaction type (a chemical constraint) nor evolutionary origin alone can explain enzyme rates. Nevertheless, chemical constraints are apparent in the convergence of active-site architectures in independently evolved enzymes, although significant variations within an architecture are common.","982":"Metal-organic complexes assembled from coordinative interactions are known to be able to display a wide range of photoluminescent behaviors benefiting from an extensive number of metal ions, organic linkers, and inclusion guests, depending on the multifaceted nature of their chemical structures and photophysical properties. In the past two decades, the white-light-emitting (WLE) and photoluminescent color-tuning (PLCT) materials based on the single-phase metal-organic coordination assemblies have merited particular attention and gained substantial advances. In this review, we give an overview of recent progress in this field, placing emphasis on the WLE and PLCT properties realized in the single-phase materials, which covers the origin, generation, and manipulation of different types of photoluminescence (PL) derived from ligand-centered (LC), metal\/cluster-centered (MC or CC), excimer\/exciplex-based (EX), metal-to-ligand or ligand-to-metal charge-transfer-based (MLCT or LMCT), or guest-included emissions. The coordination assemblies in this topic can be generally classified into three categories [(1) mono\/homometallic coordination assemblies based on main group (s,p-block), transition (d-block), or lanthanide (f-block) metal centers, (2) s\/p-f-, d-f-, or f-f-type heterometallic coordination assemblies, and (3) guest-included coordination assemblies] for which WLE and PLCT properties can be achieved by virtue of either a wide-band\/overlapped emission covering the whole visible spectrum from a single emitting center or a combination of complementary color emissions from multiple emitting centers\/origins. Some state-of-the-art assembly methods and successful design models relevant to the above three categories are elaborated to demonstrate how to achieve efficient and controllable white-light emission in a single-phase material through a tunable PL approach. Potential applications in the fields of lighting and displaying, sensing and detecting, and barcoding and patterning are surveyed, and at the end, possible prospects and challenges for future development along this line are proposed.","983":null,"984":"As an important but underappreciated field, carbohydrate chemistry is a critical topic for undergraduate students to learn. With applications to nutrition, food science, and diabetes, carbohydrates provide real-world relevance to students. This review summarizes the literature of undergraduate laboratory experiments which use carbohydrates since the year 2000. Experiments explore important chemical concepts such as synthesis, kinetics, analysis, and computational chemistry. Experiments designed for general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and analytical chemistry at a variety of skill levels are presented.","985":"Conjugated poly-ynes and poly(metalla-ynes) constitute an important class of new materials with potential application in various domains of science. The key factors responsible for the diverse usage of these materials is their intriguing and tunable chemical and photophysical properties. This review highlights fascinating advances made in the field of conjugated organic poly-ynes and poly(metalla-ynes) incorporating group 4-11 metals. This includes several important aspects of conjugated poly-ynes viz. synthetic protocols, bonding, electronic structure, nature of luminescence, structure-property relationships, diverse applications, and concluding remarks. Furthermore, we delineated the future directions and challenges in this particular area of research.","986":"Since the discovery of buckminsterfullerene over 30 years ago, sp2-hybridised carbon nanomaterials (including fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene) have stimulated new science and technology across a huge range of fields. Despite the impressive intrinsic properties, challenges in processing and chemical modification continue to hinder applications. Charged carbon nanomaterials (CCNs), formed via the reduction or oxidation of these carbon nanomaterials, facilitate dissolution, purification, separation, chemical modification, and assembly. This approach provides a compelling alternative to traditional damaging and restrictive liquid phase exfoliation routes. The broad chemistry of CCNs not only provides a versatile and potent means to modify the properties of the parent nanomaterial but also raises interesting scientific issues. This review focuses on the fundamental structural forms: buckminsterfullerene, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and single-layer graphene, describing the generation of their respective charged nanocarbon species, their interactions with solvents, chemical reactivity, specific (opto)electronic properties, and emerging applications.","987":"Neurodegenerative diseases pose a substantial socioeconomic burden on society. Unfortunately, the aging world population and lack of effective cures foreshadow a negative outlook. Although a large amount of research has been dedicated to elucidating the pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, their principal causes remain elusive. Metal ion dyshomeostasis, proteopathy, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter deficiencies are pathological features shared across multiple neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, these factors are proposed to be interrelated upon disease progression. Thus, the development of multifunctional compounds capable of simultaneously interacting with several pathological components has been suggested as a solution to undertake the complex pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we outline and discuss possible therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and molecules, previously designed or discovered as potential drug candidates for these disorders with emphasis on multifunctionality. In addition, underrepresented areas of research are discussed to indicate new directions.","988":"Complex carbohydrates are ubiquitous in nature, and together with proteins and nucleic acids they comprise the building blocks of life. But unlike proteins and nucleic acids, carbohydrates form nonlinear polymers, and they are not characterized by robust secondary or tertiary structures but rather by distributions of well-defined conformational states. Their molecular flexibility means that oligosaccharides are often refractory to crystallization, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy augmented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the leading method for their characterization in solution. The biological importance of carbohydrate-protein interactions, in organismal development as well as in disease, places urgency on the creation of innovative experimental and theoretical methods that can predict the specificity of such interactions and quantify their strengths. Additionally, the emerging realization that protein glycosylation impacts protein function and immunogenicity places the ability to define the mechanisms by which glycosylation impacts these features at the forefront of carbohydrate modeling. This review will discuss the relevant theoretical approaches to studying the three-dimensional structures of this fascinating class of molecules and interactions, with reference to the relevant experimental data and techniques that are key for validation of the theoretical predictions.","989":"","990":"Reliable and precise methods capable of unambiguously identifying target analytes in real-world samples are indispensable in various fields, ranging from biological studies and diagnosis to quality control. Among various analytic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is uniquely powerful as it provides multidimensional data useful for structural analysis at the atomic level. The rich information obtained from various NMR experiments allows one to access not only molecular structures and interactions but also the dynamics and diffusional properties. However, the interpretation of NMR data in the analysis of real-world mixtures can be challenging and is often complicated by the overlap of the NMR resonances of each component. Moreover, the inherently low sensitivity of the NMR technique hampers its implementation in many detections, where the analytes of interest are present at low concentrations. By a combination of heteronuclear NMR, dedicatedly designed sensors, ingenious transduction mechanisms, and powerful NMR pulse sequences, significant advancements were made to conquer these limitations. The present review summarizes the sensing systems that effectively facilitate NMR-based detection with an emphasis on the chemical perspective of sensor design and transduction mechanism. Advances in hyperpolarized sensors to boost the sensitivity of detection will also be included where appropriate.","991":"Over the years, scientists have identified various synthetic \"handles\" while developing wet chemical protocols for achieving a high level of shape and compositional complexity in colloidal nanomaterials. Halide ions have emerged as one such handle which serve as important surface active species that regulate nanocrystal (NC) growth and concomitant physicochemical properties. Halide ions affect the NC growth kinetics through several means, including selective binding on crystal facets, complexation with the precursors, and oxidative etching. On the other hand, their presence on the surfaces of semiconducting NCs stimulates interesting changes in the intrinsic electronic structure and interparticle communication in the NC solids eventually assembled from them. Then again, halide ions also induce optoelectronic tunability in NCs where they form part of the core, through sheer composition variation. In this review, we describe these roles of halide ions in the growth of nanostructures and the physical changes introduced by them and thereafter demonstrate the commonality of these effects across different classes of nanomaterials.","992":"Intracellular delivery is a key step in biological research and has enabled decades of biomedical discoveries. It is also becoming increasingly important in industrial and medical applications ranging from biomanufacture to cell-based therapies. Here, we review techniques for membrane disruption-based intracellular delivery from 1911 until the present. These methods achieve rapid, direct, and universal delivery of almost any cargo molecule or material that can be dispersed in solution. We start by covering the motivations for intracellular delivery and the challenges associated with the different cargo types-small molecules, proteins\/peptides, nucleic acids, synthetic nanomaterials, and large cargo. The review then presents a broad comparison of delivery strategies followed by an analysis of membrane disruption mechanisms and the biology of the cell response. We cover mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, and chemical strategies of membrane disruption with a particular emphasis on their applications and challenges to implementation. Throughout, we highlight specific mechanisms of membrane disruption and suggest areas in need of further experimentation. We hope the concepts discussed in our review inspire scientists and engineers with further ideas to improve intracellular delivery.","993":null,"994":"The metal-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition (ACA) reaction has emerged as a general and powerful approach for the construction of optically active compounds and is among the most significant and useful reactions in synthetic organic chemistry. In recent years, great progress has been made in this area with the use of various chiral metal complexes based on different chiral ligands. This review provides comprehensive and critical information on the enantioselective 1,4-conjugate addition of nonorganometallic (soft) nucleophiles and their importance in synthetic applications. The literature is covered from the last 10 years, and a number of examples from before 2007 are included as background information. The review is divided into multiple parts according to the type of nucleophile involved in the reaction (such as C-, B-, O-, N-, S-, P-, and Si-centered nucleophiles) and metal catalyst systems used.","995":"We review state-of-the-art electronic structure methods based both on wave function theory (WFT) and density functional theory (DFT). Strengths and limitations of both the wave function and density functional based approaches are discussed, and modern attempts to combine these two methods are presented. The challenges in modeling excited-state chemistry using both single-reference and multireference methods are described. Topics covered include background, combining density functional theory with single-configuration wave function theory, generalized Kohn-Sham (KS) theory, global hybrids, range-separated hybrids, local hybrids, using KS orbitals in many-body theory (including calculations of the self-energy and the GW approximation), Bethe-Salpeter equation, algorithms to accelerate GW calculations, combining DFT with multiconfigurational WFT, orbital-dependent correlation functionals based on multiconfigurational WFT, building multiconfigurational wave functions from KS configurations, adding correlation functionals to multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) energies, combining DFT with configuration-interaction singles by means of time-dependent DFT, using range separation to combine DFT with MCSCF, embedding multiconfigurational WFT in DFT, and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory.","996":"Understanding the properties of electronically excited states is a challenging task that becomes increasingly important for numerous applications in chemistry, molecular physics, molecular biology, and materials science. A substantial impact is exerted by the fascinating progress in time-resolved spectroscopy, which leads to a strongly growing demand for theoretical methods to describe the characteristic features of excited states accurately. Whereas for electronic ground state problems of stable molecules the quantum chemical methodology is now so well developed that informed nonexperts can use it efficiently, the situation is entirely different concerning the investigation of excited states. This review is devoted to a specific class of approaches, usually denoted as multireference (MR) methods, the generality of which is needed for solving many spectroscopic or photodynamical problems. However, the understanding and proper application of these MR methods is often found to be difficult due to their complexity and their computational cost. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the most important facts about the different theoretical approaches available and to present by means of a collection of characteristic examples useful information, which can guide the reader in performing their own applications.","997":"The conjugation of biomolecules can impart materials with the bioactivity necessary to modulate specific cell behaviors. While the biological roles of particular polypeptide, oligonucleotide, and glycan structures have been extensively reviewed, along with the influence of attachment on material structure and function, the key role played by the conjugation strategy in determining activity is often overlooked. In this review, we focus on the chemistry of biomolecule conjugation and provide a comprehensive overview of the key strategies for achieving controlled biomaterial functionalization. No universal method exists to provide optimal attachment, and here we will discuss both the relative advantages and disadvantages of each technique. In doing so, we highlight the importance of carefully considering the impact and suitability of a particular technique during biomaterial design.","998":"Hydroxypyridinones (HOPOs) form outstanding building blocks for the development of a variety of agents in the field of metal chelation. The pyridinone ring is easily synthesized and readily converted into tetradentate, hexadentate, and octadentate chelators. There is considerable potential for the control of the stereochemistry of the resulting metal complex and hence the properties of these multidentate molecules. Their ability to rapidly bind hard metals in aqueous media has facilitated the development of efficient applications in both biological and medical contexts. In this Review, an in-depth analysis of the synthetic methodologies for HOPO-based ligands is presented, as well as the many aspects to achieve optimal biological activity. Recent advances and current challenges for the future application of HOPO structures are outlined. The present flourishing development of drug candidates and diagnostic agents based on this chemical scaffold opens access to many new applications in analytical, environmental, and clinical science.","999":"Mesoionic carbenes are a subclass of the family of N-heterocyclic carbenes that generally feature less heteroatom stabilization of the carbenic carbon and hence impart specific donor properties and reactivity schemes when coordinated to a transition metal. Therefore, mesoionic carbenes and their complexes have attracted considerable attention both from a fundamental point of view as well as for application in catalysis and beyond. As a follow-up of an earlier Chemical Reviews overview from 2009, the organometallic chemistry of N-heterocyclic carbenes with reduced heteroatom stabilization is compiled for the 2008-2017 period, including specifically the chemistry of complexes containing 1,2,3-triazolylidenes, 4-imidazolylidenes, and related 5-membered N-heterocyclic carbenes with reduced heteratom stabilization such as (is)oxazolylidenes, pyrrazolylidenes, and thiazolylidenes, as well as pyridylidenes as 6-membered N-heterocyclic carbenes with reduced heteroatom stabilization. For each ligand subclass, metalation strategies, electronic and steric properties, and applications, in particular, in metal-mediated catalysis, are compiled. Mesoionic carbenes demonstrate particularly high activity in (water) oxidation, hydrogen transfer reactions, and cyclization reactions. Unique features of these ligands are identified such as their dipolar structure, their specific donor properties, as well as stability aspects of the ligand and the complexes, which provides opportunities for further research.","1000":"Oligosaccharides together with oligonucleotides and oligopeptides comprise the three major classes of natural biopolymers. Automated systems for oligonucleotide and oligopeptide synthesis have significantly advanced developments in biological science by allowing nonspecialists to rapidly and easily access these biopolymers. Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop a comparable general automated system to synthesize oligosaccharides. Such a system would have a revolutionary impact on the understanding of the roles of glycans in biological systems. The main challenge to achieving automated synthesis is the lack of general synthetic methods for routine synthesis of glycans. Currently, the two main methods to access homogeneous glycans and glycoconjugates are chemical synthesis and enzymatic synthesis. Enzymatic glycosylation can proceed stereo- and regiospecifically without protecting group manipulations. Moreover, the reaction conditions of enzyme-catalyzed glycosylations are extremely mild when compared to chemical glycosylations. Over the past few years methodology toward the automated chemical synthesis of oligosaccharides has been developed. Conversely, while automated enzymatic synthesis is conceptually possible, it is not as well developed. The goal of this survey is to provide a foundation on which continued technological advancements can be made to promote the automated enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides.","1001":"Transition metal-catalyzed C-H bond functionalizations have been the focus of intensive research over the last decades for the formation of C-C bonds from unfunctionalized arenes, heteroarenes, alkenes. These direct transformations provide new approaches in synthesis with high atom- and step-economy compared to the traditional catalytic cross-coupling reactions. However, such methods still suffer from several limitations including functional group tolerance and the lack of regioselectivity. In addition, they often require harsh reaction conditions and some of them need the use of strong oxidant, in a stoichiometric amount, avoiding these processes to be truly eco-friendly. The use of photoredox catalysis has contributed to a significant expansion of the scope of C(sp2)-H bond functionalizations which include the direct arylations, (perfluoro)alkylations, acylations, and even cyanations. Most of these transformations involve the photochemical induced generation of a radical followed by its regioselective addition to arenes, heteroarenes, or alkenes, leading to the building of a new C(sp2)-C bond. The use of photoredox catalysis plays crucial roles in these reactions promoting electron transfer, enabling the generation of radical species and single electron either oxidation or reduction. Such reactions operating at room temperature allow the building of C-C bonds with high chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity. This review surveys the formation of C(sp2)-C bonds initiated by photoredox catalysis which involves a C(sp2)-H bond functionalization step, describes the advantages compared to traditional C(sp2)-H bond functionalizations, and presents mechanistic insights into the role played by the photoredox catalysts.","1002":"High-oxidation-state 3d metal species have found a wide range of applications in modern synthetic chemistry and materials science. They are also implicated as key reactive species in biological reactions. These applications have thus prompted explorations of their formation, structure, and properties. While the traditional wisdom regarding these species was gained mainly from complexes supported by nitrogen- and oxygen-donor ligands, recent studies with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are widely used for the preparation of low-oxidation-state transition metal complexes in organometallic chemistry, have led to the preparation of a large variety of isolable high-oxidation-state 3d metal complexes with NHC ligation. Since the first report in this area in the 1990s, isolable complexes of this type have been reported for titanium(IV), vanadium(IV,V), chromium(IV,V), manganese(IV,V), iron(III,IV,V), cobalt(III,IV,V), nickel(IV), and copper(II). With the aim of providing an overview of this intriguing field, this Review summarizes our current understanding of the synthetic methods, structure and spectroscopic features, reactivity, and catalytic applications of high-oxidation-state 3d metal NHC complexes of titanium to copper. In addition to this progress, factors affecting the stability and reactivity of high-oxidation-state 3d metal NHC species are also presented, as well as perspectives on future efforts.","1003":"","1004":"Synthetic photoswitches have been known for many years, but their usefulness in biology, pharmacology, and medicine has only recently been systematically explored. Over the past decade photopharmacology has grown into a vibrant field. As the photophysical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of photoswitches, such as azobenzenes, have become established, they have been applied to a wide range of biological targets. These include transmembrane proteins (ion channels, transporters, G protein-coupled receptors, receptor-linked enzymes), soluble proteins (kinases, proteases, factors involved in epigenetic regulation), lipid membranes, and nucleic acids. In this review, we provide an overview of photopharmacology using synthetic switches that have been applied in vivo, i.e., in living cells and organisms. We discuss the scope and limitations of this approach to study biological function and the challenges it faces in translational medicine. The relationships between synthetic photoswitches, natural chromophores used in optogenetics, and caged ligands are addressed.","1005":"Sensory photoreceptors underpin light-dependent adaptations of organismal physiology, development, and behavior in nature. Adapted for optogenetics, sensory photoreceptors become genetically encoded actuators and reporters to enable the noninvasive, spatiotemporally accurate and reversible control by light of cellular processes. Rooted in a mechanistic understanding of natural photoreceptors, artificial photoreceptors with customized light-gated function have been engineered that greatly expand the scope of optogenetics beyond the original application of light-controlled ion flow. As we survey presently, UV\/blue-light-sensitive photoreceptors have particularly allowed optogenetics to transcend its initial neuroscience applications by unlocking numerous additional cellular processes and parameters for optogenetic intervention, including gene expression, DNA recombination, subcellular localization, cytoskeleton dynamics, intracellular protein stability, signal transduction cascades, apoptosis, and enzyme activity. The engineering of novel photoreceptors benefits from powerful and reusable design strategies, most importantly light-dependent protein association and (un)folding reactions. Additionally, modified versions of these same sensory photoreceptors serve as fluorescent proteins and generators of singlet oxygen, thereby further enriching the optogenetic toolkit. The available and upcoming UV\/blue-light-sensitive actuators and reporters enable the detailed and quantitative interrogation of cellular signal networks and processes in increasingly more precise and illuminating manners.","1006":"The plasma membrane of cells contains a diverse array of lipids that provide important structural and biological features. Glycolipids are typically a minor component of the cell membrane and consist primarily of glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs in vertebrates contain a multifarious assortment of glycan headgroups, which can be important to biological functions based on lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. The design of probes to study these complex targets requires advanced synthetic methodologies. In this Review, we will discuss recent advances in chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of GSLs in conjunction with the use of these approaches to design new probes. Examples using either chemical or enzymatic semisynthesis methods starting from isolated GSLs will also be reviewed. Focusing primarily on vertebrate glycolipids, we will highlight examples of radionuclide, fluorophore, photoresponsive, and bioorthogonal tagged GSL probes.","1007":null,"1008":"Catalytic glycosylation has been a central reaction in carbohydrate chemistry since its introduction by Fischer 125 years ago, but it is only in the past three to four decades that catalytic methods for synthesizing oligosaccharides have appeared.

This review covers all methods of catalytic glycosylation with the focus on the development and application in oligosaccharide synthesis and provide an overview of the scope and limitations of these. The review also includes relevant mechanistic studies of catalytic glycosylations. The future of catalytic glycosylation chemistry is discussed, including specific, upcoming methods and possible directions for the field of research in general.","1009":"Research pertaining to conductive polymers has gained significant traction in recent years, and their applications range from optoelectronics to material science. For all intents and purposes, conductive polymers can be described as Nobel Prize-winning materials, given that their discoverers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. In this review, we seek to describe the chemical forms and functionalities of the main types of conductive polymers, as well as their synthesis methods. We also present an in-depth analysis of composite conductive polymers that contain various nanomaterials such as graphene, fullerene, carbon nanotubes, and paramagnetic metal ions. Natural polymers such as collagen, chitosan, fibroin, and hydrogel that are structurally modified for them to be conductive are also briefly touched upon. Finally, we expound on the plethora of biomedical applications that harbor the potential to be revolutionized by conductive polymers, with a particular focus on tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biosensors.","1010":"Since the discovery of the first stable N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) in the beginning of the 1990s, these divalent carbon species have become a common and available class of compounds, which have found numerous applications in academic and industrial research. Their important role as two-electron donor ligands, especially in transition metal chemistry and catalysis, is difficult to overestimate. In the past decade, there has been tremendous research attention given to the chemistry of low-coordinate main group element compounds. Significant progress has been achieved in stabilization and isolation of such species as Lewis acid\/base adducts with highly tunable NHC ligands. This has allowed investigation of numerous novel types of compounds with unique electronic structures and opened new opportunities in the rational design of novel organic catalysts and materials. This Review gives a general overview of this research, basic synthetic approaches, key features of NHC-main group element adducts, and might be useful for the broad research community.","1011":"","1012":"Arylated products are found in various fields of chemistry and represent essential entities for many applications. Therefore, the formation of this structural feature represents a central issue of contemporary organic synthesis. By the action of electricity the necessity of leaving groups, metal catalysts, stoichiometric oxidizers, or reducing agents can be omitted in part or even completely. The replacement of conventional reagents by sustainable electricity not only will be environmentally benign but also allows significant short cuts in electrochemical synthesis. In addition, this methodology can be considered as inherently safe. The current survey is organized in cathodic and anodic conversions as well as by the number of leaving groups being involved. In some electroconversions the reagents used are regenerated at the electrode, whereas in other electrotransformations free radical sequences are exploited to afford a highly sustainable process. The electrochemical formation of the aryl-substrate bond is discussed for aromatic substrates, heterocycles, other multiple bond systems, and even at saturated carbon substrates.

These layered materials have been extensively investigated over synthesis and optical and electrical properties for several decades. It can be insulators, semiconductors, or metals revealing all types of condensed matter properties from a magnetic lattice distorted to superconducting characteristics. Some of these also feature the topological manner. Instead of covering the semiconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides, which have been extensively revisited and reviewed elsewhere, here we present the structures of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides and their synthetic approaches for not only high-quality wafer-scale samples using conventional methods (e.g., chemical vapor transport, chemical vapor deposition) but also local small areas by a modification of the materials using Li intercalation, electron beam irradiation, light illumination, pressures, and strains. Some representative band structures of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides and their strong layer-dependence are reviewed and updated, both in theoretical calculations and experiments. In addition, we discuss the physical properties of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides such as periodic lattice distortion, magnetoresistance, superconductivity, topological insulator, and Weyl semimetal. Approaches to overcome current challenges related to these materials are also proposed.","1014":"Polymeric micelles are demonstrating high potential as nanomedicines capable of controlling the distribution and function of loaded bioactive agents in the body, effectively overcoming biological barriers, and various formulations are engaged in intensive preclinical and clinical testing.

The aspects involved in the design of successful micellar carriers are described in detail on the basis of the type of polymer\/payload interaction, as well as the interplay of micelles with the biological interface, emphasizing on the chemistry and engineering of the block copolymers. By shaping these features, polymeric micelles have been propitious for delivering a wide range of therapeutics through effective sensing of targets in the body and adjustment of their properties in response to particular stimuli, modulating the activity of the loaded drugs at the targeted sites, even at the subcellular level. Finally, the future perspectives and imminent challenges for polymeric micelles as nanomedicines are discussed, anticipating to spur further innovations.","1015":null,"1016":"Deoxy-sugars often play a critical role in modulating the potency of many bioactive natural products. Accordingly, there has been sustained interest in methods for their synthesis over the past several decades.

These automated technologies also present opportunities for their application to organic synthesis, including that of the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, application of automated methods to the synthesis of carbohydrates is an underdeveloped area as compared to other classes of biomolecules. The overarching goal of this review article is to present the advances that have been made at the interface of carbohydrate chemistry and automated technology.","1018":null,"1019":"Dysregulation of cancer cell metabolism contributes to abnormal cell growth, the biological end point of cancer.

The list includes cytochrome P450 and other heme-based monooxygenases, heme-based dioxygenases, nonheme iron mono- and dioxygenases, flavoproteins, radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes, copper enzymes, and peroxidases. Reactions involve steroids, intermediary metabolism, secondary natural products, drugs, and industrial and agricultural chemicals. Many C-C bonds are formed via either (i) coupling of diradicals or (ii) generation of unstable products that rearrange. C-C cleavage reactions involve several themes: (i) rearrangement of unstable oxidized products produced by the enzymes, (ii) oxidation and collapse of radicals or cations via rearrangement, (iii) oxygenation to yield products that are readily hydrolyzed by other enzymes, and (iv) activation of O2 in systems in which the binding of a substrate facilitates O2 activation. Many of the enzymes involve metals, but of these, iron is clearly predominant.","1022":"As one unique group of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, 2D metal nanomaterials have drawn increasing attention owing to their intriguing physiochemical properties and broad range of promising applications. In this Review, we briefly introduce the general synthetic strategies applied to 2D metal nanomaterials, followed by describing in detail the various synthetic methods classified in two categories, i.e. bottom-up methods and top-down methods. After introducing the unique physical and chemical properties of 2D metal nanomaterials, the potential applications of 2D metal nanomaterials in catalysis, surface enhanced Raman scattering, sensing, bioimaging, solar cells, and photothermal therapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this promising research area are proposed.","1023":"Protein lysine methylation is a distinct posttranslational modification that causes minimal changes in the size and electrostatic status of lysine residues. Lysine methylation plays essential roles in regulating fates and functions of target proteins in an epigenetic manner. As a result, substrates and degrees (free versus mono\/di\/tri) of protein lysine methylation are orchestrated within cells by balanced activities of protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) and demethylases (KDMs). Their dysregulation is often associated with neurological disorders, developmental abnormalities, or cancer. Methyllysine-containing proteins can be recognized by downstream effector proteins, which contain methyllysine reader domains, to relay their biological functions. While numerous efforts have been made to annotate biological roles of protein lysine methylation, limited work has been done to uncover mechanisms associated with this modification at a molecular or atomic level. Given distinct biophysical and biochemical properties of methyllysine, this review will focus on chemical and biochemical aspects in addition, recognition, and removal of this posttranslational mark. Chemical and biophysical methods to profile PKMT substrates will be discussed along with classification of PKMT inhibitors for accurate perturbation of methyltransferase activities. Semisynthesis of methyllysine-containing proteins will also be covered given the critical need for these reagents to unambiguously define functional roles of protein lysine methylation.","1024":"Over the past decade, researchers have highlighted the importance of mechanical cues of the metastatic niche such as matrix stiffness, topography, mechanical stresses, and deformation on cells in influencing tumor growth and proliferation. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis and fine-tuning the mechano-response of cancer cells to this niche could lead to new and novel therapeutic interventions. In this review, we discuss the importance of mechanical cues surrounding tumor microenvironment that govern the growth and progression of cancer. We also highlight some emergent principles underlying the mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms that link cellular responses such as gene expression to phenotypic changes arising from such external cues. Recent technological advancements to visualize, quantify, model, and test these crucial steps with great precision will further advance our understanding of this phenomenon. We will conclude by showcasing potential applications of mechanobiology in controlling cancer growth as alternative cancer treatment regimes.","1025":"The precise control in size\/thickness, composition, crystal phases, doping, defects, and surface properties of two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) is important for the investigation of interwoven relationship between structures, functions, and practical applications. Of the multiple synthetic routes, solution-based top-down and bottom-up chemical methods have been uniquely important for their potential to control the size and composition at the molecular level in addition to their scalability, competitive production cost, and solution processability. Here, we introduce an overview of the recent advances in the solution-based preparation routes of 2D layered TMC nanostructures along with important scientific developments.","1026":"The discovery of graphene one decade ago has triggered enormous interest in developing two-dimensional materials (2DMs)-that is 2D allotropes of various elements or compounds (consisting of two or more covalently bonded elements) or molecular frameworks with periodic structures. At present, various synthesis strategies have been exploited to produce 2DMs, such as top-down exfoliation and bottom-up chemical vapor deposition and solution synthesis methods. In this review article, we will highlight the interfacial roles toward the controlled synthesis of inorganic and organic 2DMs with varied structural features. We will summarize the state-of-the-art progress on interfacial synthesis strategies and address their advancements in the structural, morphological, and crystalline control by the direction of the arrangement of the molecules or precursors at a confined 2D space. First, we will provide an overview of the interfaces and introduce their advantages and uniqueness for the synthesis of 2DMs, followed by a brief classification of inorganic and organic 2DMs achieved by interfacial synthesis. Next, the currently developed interfacial synthesis strategies combined with representative inorganic and organic 2DMs are summarized, including the description of method details, the corresponding structural features, and the insights into the advantages and limitations of the synthesis methods, along with some recommendable characterization methods for understanding the interfacial assembly of the precursors and crystal growth of 2DMs. After that, we will discuss several classes of emerging organic 2DMs with particular emphasis on the structural control by the interfacial synthesis strategies. Note that, inorganic 2DMs will not be categorized separately due to the fact that a number of review articles have covered the synthesis, structure, processing, and applications. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are provided regarding the future development of interface-assisted synthesis of 2DMs with diverse structural and functional control.","1027":"Over the past 35 years, DNA has been used to produce various nanometer-scale constructs, nanomechanical devices, and walkers. Construction of complex DNA nanostructures relies on the creation of rigid DNA motifs. Paranemic crossover (PX) DNA is one such motif that has played many roles in DNA nanotechnology. Specifically, PX cohesion has been used to connect topologically closed molecules, to assemble a three-dimensional object, and to create two-dimensional DNA crystals. Additionally, a sequence-dependent nanodevice based on conformational change between PX and its topoisomer, JX2, has been used in robust nanoscale assembly lines, as a key component in a DNA transducer, and to dictate polymer assembly. Furthermore, the PX motif has recently found a new role directly in basic biology, by possibly serving as the molecular structure for double-stranded DNA homology recognition, a prominent feature of molecular biology and essential for many crucial biological processes. This review discusses the many attributes and usages of PX-DNA-its design, characteristics, applications, and potential biological relevance-and aims to accelerate the understanding of PX-DNA motif in its many roles and manifestations.","1028":"Metal-catalyzed reductive coupling has emerged as an alternative to the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents in an increasingly diverse range of carbonyl and imine additions.

Following a discussion about fundamental conceptual aspects of the physical nature of core excitations and the concomitant requirements on theoretical methods, an overview is given of the major developments made in electronic-structure theory for the purpose of simulating advanced X-ray spectroscopies, covering methods based on density-functional theory as well as wave function theory. The capabilities of these theoretical approaches are illustrated by an overview of simulations of selected linear and nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray natural circular dichroism (XNCD), X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), and X-ray two-photon absorption (XTPA).","1030":"This Review of Chemistry Education Research (CER) provides an overview of the development of research in chemistry education from the early days, when ideas about how to teach chemistry and help students learn were guided by practitioner wisdom, to current research that is based on theories of learning and provides evidence from which to make arguments about improving teaching and learning. We introduce the dominant learning theories that have guided CER over the years and attempt to show how they have been integrated into modern research in chemistry education. We also provide examples of how this research can be used to inform the development and use of educational materials. Because CER literature is vast, we chose to limit the research we reviewed to those studies that help us answer three driving questions: (1) What should students know and be able to do with that knowledge? (2) How will we know that students have developed a coherent and useful understanding of chemistry? (3) What evidence do we have about how to help students develop a deep and robust understanding of chemistry?","1031":"Early research on the four microbial rhodopsins discovered in the archaeal Halobacterium salinarum revealed a structural template that served as a scaffold for two different functions: light-driven ion transport and phototaxis. Bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin are proton and chloride pumps, respectively, while sensory rhodopsin I and II are responsible for phototactic behavior of the archaea. Halorhodopsins have been identified in various other species. Besides this group of archaeal halorhodopsins distinct chloride transporting rhodopsins groups have recently been identified in other organism like Flavobacteria or Cyanobacteria. Halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis is the best-studied homologue because of its facile expression and purification and its advantageous properties, which was the reason to introduce this protein as neural silencer into the new field of optogenetics. Two other major families of genetically encoded silencing proteins, proton pumps and anion channels, extended the repertoire of optogenetic tools. Here, we describe the functional and structural characteristics of halorhodopsins. We will discuss the data in light of common principles underlying the mechanism of ion pumps and sensors and will review biophysical and biochemical aspects of neuronal silencers.","1032":"Degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affect millions of people around the world and lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated. A number of therapeutic strategies have been developed over the years to treat these diseases or restore vision to already blind patients. In this Review, we describe the development and translational application of light-sensitive chemical photoswitches to restore visual function to the blind retina and compare the translational potential of photoswitches with other vision-restoring therapies. This therapeutic strategy is enabled by an efficient fusion of chemical synthesis, chemical biology, and molecular biology and is broadly applicable to other biological systems. We hope this Review will be of interest to chemists as well as neuroscientists and clinicians.","1033":"Carbohydrates, which are ubiquitously distributed throughout the three domains of life, play significant roles in a variety of vital biological processes. Access to unique and homogeneous carbohydrate materials is important to understand their physical properties, biological functions, and disease-related features. It is difficult to isolate carbohydrates in acceptable purity and amounts from natural sources. Therefore, complex saccharides with well-defined structures are often most conviently accessed through chemical syntheses. Two major hurdles, regioselective protection and stereoselective glycosylation, are faced by carbohydrate chemists in synthesizing these highly complicated molecules. Over the past few years, there has been a radical change in tackling these problems and speeding up the synthesis of oligosaccharides. This is largely due to the development of one-pot protection, one-pot glycosylation, and one-pot protection-glycosylation protocols and streamlined approaches to orthogonally protected building blocks, including those from rare sugars, that can be used in glycan coupling. In addition, new automated strategies for oligosaccharide syntheses have been reported not only for program-controlled assembly on solid support but also by the stepwise glycosylation in solution phase. As a result, various sugar molecules with highly complex, large structures could be successfully synthesized. To summarize these recent advances, this review describes the methodologies for one-pot protection and their one-pot glycosylation into the complex glycans and the chronological developments associated with automated syntheses of oligosaccharides.","1034":"Faithful transmission and maintenance of genetic material is primarily fulfilled by DNA polymerases. During DNA replication, these enzymes catalyze incorporation of deoxynucleotides into a DNA primer strand based on Watson-Crick complementarity to the DNA template strand. Through the years, research on DNA polymerases from every family and reverse transcriptases has revealed structural and functional similarities, including a conserved domain architecture and purported two-metal-ion mechanism for nucleotidyltransfer. However, it is equally clear that DNA polymerases possess distinct differences that often prescribe a particular cellular role. Indeed, a unified kinetic mechanism to explain all aspects of DNA polymerase catalysis, including DNA binding, nucleotide binding and incorporation, and metal-ion-assisted nucleotidyltransfer (i.e., chemistry), has been difficult to define. In particular, the contributions of enzyme conformational dynamics to several mechanistic steps and their implications for replication fidelity are complex. Moreover, recent time-resolved X-ray crystallographic studies of DNA polymerases have uncovered a third divalent metal ion present during DNA synthesis, the function of which is currently unclear and debated within the field. In this review, we survey past and current literature describing the structures and kinetic mechanisms of DNA polymerases from each family to explore every major mechanistic step while emphasizing the impact of enzyme conformational dynamics on DNA synthesis and replication fidelity. This also includes brief insight into the structural and kinetic techniques utilized to study DNA polymerases and RTs. Furthermore, we present the evidence for the two-metal-ion mechanism for DNA polymerase catalysis prior to interpreting the recent structural findings describing a third divalent metal ion. We conclude by discussing the diversity of DNA polymerase mechanisms and suggest future characterization of the third divalent metal ion to dissect its role in DNA polymerase catalysis.","1035":"When metal nanoparticles are arranged in an ordered array, they may scatter light to produce diffracted waves. If one of the diffracted waves then propagates in the plane of the array, it may couple the localized plasmon resonances associated with individual nanoparticles together, leading to an exciting phenomenon, the drastic narrowing of plasmon resonances, down to 1-2 nm in spectral width. This presents a dramatic improvement compared to a typical single particle resonance line width of &gt;80 nm. The very high quality factors of these diffractively coupled plasmon resonances, often referred to as plasmonic surface lattice resonances, and related effects have made this topic a very active and exciting field for fundamental research, and increasingly, these resonances have been investigated for their potential in the development of practical devices for communications, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, data storage, biosensing, and other applications. In the present review article, we describe the basic physical principles and properties of plasmonic surface lattice resonances: the width and quality of the resonances, singularities of the light phase, electric field enhancement, etc. We pay special attention to the conditions of their excitation in different experimental architectures by considering the following: in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations of the incident light, symmetric and asymmetric optical (refractive index) environments, the presence of substrate conductivity, and the presence of an active or magnetic medium. Finally, we review recent progress in applications of plasmonic surface lattice resonances in various fields.","1036":"With the continuous development of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) chemistry during the past decade, NHC metal complexes have gained wide applications in the research field of organometallic catalysis. The recycling and reuse of NHC metal complexes, which have undergone continuous expansion and diversification, can enhance their catalytic performance, extend their range of application, and afford new routes to green chemistry. Taking NHC metal complex catalysts as the main topic, this review intends to present a comprehensive study of recycling strategies of organometallic catalysts. By an elaborative summarization and classification of recycling strategies, a clear picture of all available of recycling strategies for organometallic catalysts is presented and the advantages and disadvantages of various recycling strategies for specific reactions are discussed in detail. This review is written with the hope of serving as a modest spur to induce other scientists' further contributions in the fields of catalyst recycling and sustainable catalysis.","1037":null,"1038":"This Review details synthetic routes toward and properties of insoluble polymeric organic semiconductors obtained through desolubilization strategies. Typical applications include fixation of donor-acceptor bulk-heterojunction morphologies in organic photovoltaic cells, cross-linking of charge transport materials and active emitters in light emitting diodes or similar devices, and immobilization of morphologies in field effect transistors. A second important application is the structuring of organic semiconductors, using them as photoresists. After desolubilization, removal of the nonirradiated resist leads to elevated, micron-sized features of the semiconductor. In this Review, different strategies for desolubilization are covered. By photochemical or thermal cleavage of solubility-mediating groups such as esters, sulfonium salts, amides, ethers, and acetals or by retro-Diels-Alder reactions, volatile elimination products and the insoluble semiconductor are formed. In another case, desolubilization is achieved by cross-linking via functional groups present in the polymer side chains including vinyl, halide, silicone, boronic acid, and azide functionalities, which polymerize thermally or photochemically. Alternatively, small molecular additives such as photoacids, oligothiols, or oligoazides result in network formation in combination with compatible functional groups present in the immobilizable polymers. Advantages and disadvantages of the respective methods are discussed.","1039":"A critical review of the state-of-the-art evidence in support of the mechanisms of glycosylation reactions is provided. Factors affecting the stability of putative oxocarbenium ions as intermediates at the SN1 end of the mechanistic continuum are first surveyed before the evidence, spectroscopic and indirect, for the existence of such species on the time scale of glycosylation reactions is presented. Current models for diastereoselectivity in nucleophilic attack on oxocarbenium ions are then described. Evidence in support of the intermediacy of activated covalent glycosyl donors is reviewed, before the influences of the structure of the nucleophile, of the solvent, of temperature, and of donor-acceptor hydrogen bonding on the mechanism of glycosylation reactions are surveyed. Studies on the kinetics of glycosylation reactions and the use of kinetic isotope effects for the determination of transition-state structure are presented, before computational models are finally surveyed.

Well-designed \"bipolar electrodes\" have enabled the production of patterned gradient polymer brushes and microfibers. For the display of combinatorial organic electrochemistry, batch and flow electrolysis systems for the optimization and screening of electro-organic reactions as well as the building of chemical libraries for organic compounds are described.","1043":"The molecular analysis of biomolecular-membrane interactions is central to understanding most cellular systems but has emerged as a complex technical challenge given the complexities of membrane structure and composition across all living cells. We present a review of the application of surface plasmon resonance and dual polarization interferometry-based biosensors to the study of biomembrane-based systems using both planar mono- or bilayers or liposomes. We first describe the optical principals and instrumentation of surface plasmon resonance, including both linear and extraordinary transmission modes and dual polarization interferometry. We then describe the wide range of model membrane systems that have been developed for deposition on the chips surfaces that include planar, polymer cushioned, tethered bilayers, and liposomes. This is followed by a description of the different chemical immobilization or physisorption techniques. The application of this broad range of engineered membrane surfaces to biomolecular-membrane interactions is then overviewed and how the information obtained using these techniques enhance our molecular understanding of membrane-mediated peptide and protein function. We first discuss experiments where SPR alone has been used to characterize membrane binding and describe how these studies yielded novel insight into the molecular events associated with membrane interactions and how they provided a significant impetus to more recent studies that focus on coincident membrane structure changes during binding of peptides and proteins. We then discuss the emerging limitations of not monitoring the effects on membrane structure and how SPR data can be combined with DPI to provide significant new information on how a membrane responds to the binding of peptides and proteins.","1044":"Recent advances in flexible and stretchable electronics (FSE), a technology diverging from the conventional rigid silicon technology, have stimulated fundamental scientific and technological research efforts. FSE aims at enabling disruptive applications such as flexible displays, wearable sensors, printed RFID tags on packaging, electronics on skin\/organs, and Internet-of-things as well as possibly reducing the cost of electronic device fabrication. Thus, the key materials components of electronics, the semiconductor, the dielectric, and the conductor as well as the passive (substrate, planarization, passivation, and encapsulation layers) must exhibit electrical performance and mechanical properties compatible with FSE components and products. In this review, we summarize and analyze recent advances in materials concepts as well as in thin-film fabrication techniques for high- k (or high-capacitance) gate dielectrics when integrated with FSE-compatible semiconductors such as organics, metal oxides, quantum dot arrays, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other 2D semiconductors. Since thin-film transistors (TFTs) are the key enablers of FSE devices, we discuss TFT structures and operation mechanisms after a discussion on the needs and general requirements of gate dielectrics. Also, the advantages of high- k dielectrics over low- k ones in TFT applications were elaborated. Next, after presenting the design and properties of high- k polymers and inorganic, electrolyte, and hybrid dielectric families, we focus on the most important fabrication methodologies for their deposition as TFT gate dielectric thin films. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of recent progress in performance of FSE TFTs based on these high- k dielectrics, focusing primarily on emerging semiconductor types. Finally, we conclude with an outlook and challenges section.","1045":"Plasmonic molecules are small assemblies of nanosized metal particles. Interactions between the particles modify their optical properties and make them attractive for multiple applications in spectroscopy and sensing. In this review, we focus on basic properties rather than on applications. Plasmonic molecules can be created using either nanofabrication methods or self-assembly techniques in solution. The interaction of plasmonic molecules with light leads to excitations that are classified using the concept of normal modes. The simplest plasmonic molecule is a dimer of particles, and its lowest energy excitation takes the form of a symmetric dipolar mode. More complex excitations take place when a larger number of particles is involved. The gaps between particles in a plasmonic molecule form hotspots in which the electromagnetic field is concentrated. Introducing molecules into these hotspots is the basis of a vast spectrum of enhanced spectroscopies, from surface-enhanced Raman scattering to surface-enhanced fluorescence and others. We show in this review how these spectroscopic methods can be used to characterize the fields around plasmonic molecules. Furthermore, the strong fields can be used to drive new phenomena, from plasmon-induced chemical reactions to strong coupling of quantum emitters with the plasmonic fields. We systematically discuss these phenomena, introducing in each case the theoretical basis as well as recent experimental realizations.","1046":null,"1047":"Nonadiabatic mixed quantum-classical (NA-MQC) dynamics methods form a class of computational theoretical approaches in quantum chemistry tailored to investigate the time evolution of nonadiabatic phenomena in molecules and supramolecular assemblies. NA-MQC is characterized by a partition of the molecular system into two subsystems: one to be treated quantum mechanically (usually but not restricted to electrons) and another to be dealt with classically (nuclei). The two subsystems are connected through nonadiabatic couplings terms to enforce self-consistency. A local approximation underlies the classical subsystem, implying that direct dynamics can be simulated, without needing precomputed potential energy surfaces. The NA-MQC split allows reducing computational costs, enabling the treatment of realistic molecular systems in diverse fields. Starting from the three most well-established methods-mean-field Ehrenfest, trajectory surface hopping, and multiple spawning-this review focuses on the NA-MQC dynamics methods and programs developed in the last 10 years. It stresses the relations between approaches and their domains of application. The electronic structure methods most commonly used together with NA-MQC dynamics are reviewed as well. The accuracy and precision of NA-MQC simulations are critically discussed, and general guidelines to choose an adequate method for each application are delivered.","1048":"In the past decade or so, small-pore zeolites have received greater attention than large- and medium-pore molecular sieves that have historically dominated the literature. This is primarily due to the commercialization of two major catalytic processes, NOx exhaust removal and methanol conversion to light olefins, that take advantage of the properties of these materials with smaller apertures. Small-pore zeolites possess pores that are constructed of eight tetrahedral atoms (Si4+ and Al3+), each time linked by a shared oxygen These eight-member ring pores (8MR) provide small molecules access to the intracrystalline void space, e.g., to NOx during car exhaust cleaning (NOx removal) or to methanol en route to its conversion into light olefins, while restricting larger molecule entrance and departure that is critical to overall catalyst performance. In total, there are forty-four structurally different small-pore zeolites. Forty-one of these zeolites can be synthesized, and the first synthetic zeolite (KFI, 1948) was in fact a small-pore material. Although the field of 8MR zeolite chemistry has expanded in many directions, the progress in synthesis is framework-specific, leaving insights and generalizations difficult to realize. This review first focuses on the relevant synthesis details of all 8MR zeolites and provides some generalized findings and related insights. Next, catalytic applications where 8MR zeolites either have been commercialized or have dominated investigations are presented, with the aim of providing structure-activity relationships. The review ends with a summary that discusses (i) both synthetic and catalytic progress, (ii) a list of opportunities in the 8MR zeolite field, and (iii) a brief future outlook.","1049":"","1050":"","1051":"Hundreds of polymers have been evaluated as membrane materials for gas separations, but fewer than 10 have made it into current commercial applications, mainly due to the effects of physical aging and plasticization. Efforts to overcome these two problems are a significant focus in gas separation membrane research, in conjunction with improving membrane separation performance to surpass the Robeson upper bounds of selectivity versus permeability for commercially important gas pairs. While there has been extensive research, ranging from manipulating the chemistry of existing polymers (e.g., thermally rearranged or cross-linked polyimides) to synthesizing new polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), there have been three major oversights that this review addresses: (1) the need to compare the approaches to achieving the best performance in order to identify their effectiveness in improving gas transport properties and in mitigating aging, (2) a common standardized aging protocol that allows rapid determination of the success (or not) of these approaches, and (3) standard techniques that can be used to characterize aging and plasticization across all studies to enable them to be robustly and equally compared. In this review, we also provide our perspectives on a few key aspects of research related to high free volume polymer membranes: (1) the importance of Robeson plots for membrane aging studies, (2) eliminating thermal history, (3) measurement and reporting of gas permeability and aging rate, (4) aging and storing conditions, and (5) promising approaches to mitigate aging.","1052":"The main contributions in the field of first-row transition-metal-catalyzed (base-metal-catalyzed) carbonylative transformations have been summarized and discussed.

While turnover of N-oxyl catalysts in oxidation reactions may be accomplished with a variety of stoichiometric oxidants, N-oxyl reagents have also been extensively used as catalysts under electrochemical conditions in the absence of chemical oxidants. Several classes of N-oxyl compounds undergo facile redox reactions at electrode surfaces, enabling them to mediate a wide range of electrosynthetic reactions. Electrochemical studies also provide insights into the structural properties and mechanisms of chemical and electrochemical catalysis by N-oxyl compounds. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the electrochemical properties and electrocatalytic applications of aminoxyls, imidoxyls, and related reagents, of which the two prototypical and widely used examples are 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl (TEMPO) and phthalimide N-oxyl (PINO).","1054":"Nanomedicine is a discipline that applies nanoscience and nanotechnology principles to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. Self-assembly of molecular components is becoming a common strategy in the design and syntheses of nanomaterials for biomedical applications. In both natural and synthetic self-assembled nanostructures, molecular cooperativity is emerging as an important hallmark. In many cases, interplay of many types of noncovalent interactions leads to dynamic nanosystems with emergent properties where the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the cooperativity principles in multiple self-assembled nanostructures. We discuss the molecular origin and quantitative modeling of cooperative behaviors. In selected systems, we describe the examples on how to leverage molecular cooperativity to design nanomedicine with improved diagnostic precision and therapeutic efficacy in medicine.","1055":"","1056":"Ionic liquids (ILs) have gained considerable attention in recent years as CO2-reactive solvents that could be used to improve the economic efficiency of industrial-scale CO2 separations. Researchers have demonstrated that IL physical and chemical properties can be optimized for a given application through chemical functionalization of both cations and anions. The tunability of ILs presents both a great potential and a significant challenge due to the complex chemistries and the many ways in which ILs can be made to react with CO2. However, computer simulations have demonstrated great potential in understanding the behavior of ILs from the underlying molecular interactions. In the present review, we examine how computer simulations have aided in the design of ILs that chemically bind CO2. We present the historical development of CO2-reactive ILs while highlighting the insights provided by molecular modeling which aided in understanding IL behavior to further experimental findings. We also provide a brief discussion of simulations focused on ionic liquids that physically dissolve CO2. We conclude with a discussion of areas where simulations can yet be used to advance the current understanding of these complex systems and an outlook on the use of computer simulations in the design of optimal ILs for CO2 separations.","1057":null,"1058":"Visible light-driven water splitting using cheap and robust photocatalysts is one of the most exciting ways to produce clean and renewable energy for future generations. Cutting edge research within the field focuses on so-called \"Z-scheme\" systems, which are inspired by the photosystem II-photosystem I (PSII\/PSI) coupling from natural photosynthesis. A Z-scheme system comprises two photocatalysts and generates two sets of charge carriers, splitting water into its constituent parts, hydrogen and oxygen, at separate locations. This is not only more efficient than using a single photocatalyst, but practically it could also be safer. Researchers within the field are constantly aiming to bring systems toward industrial level efficiencies by maximizing light absorption of the materials, engineering more stable redox couples, and also searching for new hydrogen and oxygen evolution cocatalysts. This review provides an in-depth survey of relevant Z-schemes from past to present, with particular focus on mechanistic breakthroughs, and highlights current state of the art systems which are at the forefront of the field.","1059":"New technologies to diagnose malaria at high sensitivity and specificity are urgently needed in the developing world where the disease continues to pose a huge burden on society. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy-based diagnostic methods have a number of advantages compared with other diagnostic tests currently on the market. These include high sensitivity and specificity for detecting low levels of parasitemia along with ease of use and portability. Here, we review the application of vibrational spectroscopic techniques for monitoring and detecting malaria infection. We discuss the role of vibrational (infrared and Raman) spectroscopy in understanding the processes of parasite biology and its application to the study of interactions with antimalarial drugs. The distinct molecular phenotype that characterizes malaria infection and the high sensitivity enabling detection of low parasite densities provides a genuine opportunity for vibrational spectroscopy to become a front-line tool in the elimination of this deadly disease and provide molecular insights into the chemistry of this unique organism.","1060":"The electronic excited states of molecular aggregates and their photophysical signatures have long fascinated spectroscopists and theoreticians alike since the advent of Frenkel exciton theory almost 90 years ago. The influence of molecular packing on basic optical probes like absorption and photoluminescence was originally worked out by Kasha for aggregates dominated by Coulombic intermolecular interactions, eventually leading to the classification of J- and H-aggregates. This review outlines advances made in understanding the relationship between aggregate structure and photophysics when vibronic coupling and intermolecular charge transfer are incorporated. An assortment of packing geometries is considered from the humble molecular dimer to more exotic structures including linear and bent aggregates, two-dimensional herringbone and \"HJ\" aggregates, and chiral aggregates. The interplay between long-range Coulomb coupling and short-range charge-transfer-mediated coupling strongly depends on the aggregate architecture leading to a wide array of photophysical behaviors.","1061":"Metal species with different size (single atoms, nanoclusters, and nanoparticles) show different catalytic behavior for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions. It has been shown in the literature that many factors including the particle size, shape, chemical composition, metal-support interaction, and metal-reactant\/solvent interaction can have significant influences on the catalytic properties of metal catalysts. The recent developments of well-controlled synthesis methodologies and advanced characterization tools allow one to correlate the relationships at the molecular level. In this Review, the electronic and geometric structures of single atoms, nanoclusters, and nanoparticles will be discussed. Furthermore, we will summarize the catalytic applications of single atoms, nanoclusters, and nanoparticles for different types of reactions, including CO oxidation, selective oxidation, selective hydrogenation, organic reactions, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic reactions. We will compare the results obtained from different systems and try to give a picture on how different types of metal species work in different reactions and give perspectives on the future directions toward better understanding of the catalytic behavior of different metal entities (single atoms, nanoclusters, and nanoparticles) in a unifying manner.","1062":"Flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, are critically important human pathogens that sicken a staggeringly high number of humans every year. Most of these pathogens are transmitted by mosquitos, and not surprisingly, as the earth warms and human populations grow and move, their geographic reach is increasing. Flaviviruses are simple RNA-protein machines that carry out protein synthesis, genome replication, and virion packaging in close association with cellular lipid membranes. In this review, we examine the molecular biology of flaviviruses touching on the structure and function of viral components and how these interact with host factors. The latter are functionally divided into pro-viral and antiviral factors, both of which, not surprisingly, include many RNA binding proteins. In the interface between the virus and the hosts we highlight the role of a noncoding RNA produced by flaviviruses to impair antiviral host immune responses. Throughout the review, we highlight areas of intense investigation, or a need for it, and potential targets and tools to consider in the important battle against pathogenic flaviviruses.","1063":"Singlet fission is a photophysical reaction in which a singlet excited electronic state splits into two spin-triplet states. Singlet fission was discovered more than 50 years ago, but the interest in this process has gained a lot of momentum in the past decade due to its potential as a way to boost solar cell efficiencies. This review presents and discusses the most recent advances with respect to the theoretical and computational studies on the singlet fission phenomenon. The work revisits important aspects regarding electronic states involved in the process, the evaluation of fission rates and interstate couplings, the study of the excited state dynamics in singlet fission, and the advances in the design and characterization of singlet fission compounds and materials such as molecular dimers, polymers, or extended structures. Finally, the review tries to pinpoint some aspects that need further improvement and proposes future lines of research for theoretical and computational chemists and physicists in order to further push the understanding and applicability of singlet fission.","1064":"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) inherits the rich chemical fingerprint information on Raman spectroscopy and gains sensitivity by plasmon-enhanced excitation and scattering. In particular, most Raman peaks have a narrow width suitable for multiplex analysis, and the measurements can be conveniently made under ambient and aqueous conditions. These merits make SERS a very promising technique for studying complex biological systems, and SERS has attracted increasing interest in biorelated analysis. However, there are still great challenges that need to be addressed until it can be widely accepted by the biorelated communities, answer interesting biological questions, and solve fatal clinical problems. SERS applications in bioanalysis involve the complex interactions of plasmonic nanomaterials with biological systems and their environments. The reliability becomes the key issue of bioanalytical SERS in order to extract meaningful information from SERS data. This review provides a comprehensive overview of bioanalytical SERS with the main focus on the reliability issue. We first introduce the mechanism of SERS to guide the design of reliable SERS experiments with high detection sensitivity. We then introduce the current understanding of the interaction of nanomaterials with biological systems, mainly living cells, to guide the design of functionalized SERS nanoparticles for target detection. We further introduce the current status of label-free (direct) and labeled (indirect) SERS detections, for systems from biomolecules, to pathogens, to living cells, and we discuss the potential interferences from experimental design, measurement conditions, and data analysis. In the end, we give an outlook of the key challenges in bioanalytical SERS, including reproducibility, sensitivity, and spatial and time resolution.","1065":"Conducting polymers (CPs), thanks to their unique properties, structures made on-demand, new composite mixtures, and possibility of deposit on a surface by chemical, physical, or electrochemical methodologies, have shown in the last years a renaissance and have been widely used in important fields of chemistry and materials science. Due to the extent of the literature on CPs, this review, after a concise introduction about the interrelationship between electrochemistry and conducting polymers, is focused exclusively on the following applications: energy (energy storage devices and solar cells), use in environmental remediation (anion and cation trapping, electrocatalytic reduction\/oxidation of pollutants on CP based electrodes, and adsorption of pollutants) and finally electroanalysis as chemical sensors in solution, gas phase, and chiral molecules. This review is expected to be comprehensive, authoritative, and useful to the chemical community interested in CPs and their applications.","1066":null,"1067":"Oxygenases-catalyzed reductive activation of molecular oxygen and incorporation of O atoms into an organic molecule is undoubtedly one of the most attractive research areas. Typically, these oxygenation reactions proceed with high selectivity and reactivity, which is seldom found in its \"biomimetic\" chemocatalytic counterparts. Furthermore, enzymatic oxygenation can avoid undesired overoxidation, which is frequently observed in (industrial) chemical transformation. Therefore, it is not surprising that tremendous attention has been paid to enzymatic oxygenation. Their application in organic synthesis has been steadily growing over the years. The goal of the present Review is to provide a handy reference for chemists interested in using homogeneous oxygenase catalysis and those interested in discovering new types of biomimetic oxidations and oxygenations with dioxygen. In this Review, we will review the recent advances in in homogeneous oxygenase catalysis to reveal the great achievements and potentials in this field.","1068":"","1069":"New methods for preparation of tailor-made fluorine-containing compounds are in extremely high demand in nearly every sector of chemical industry. The asymmetric construction of quaternary C-F stereogenic centers is the most synthetically challenging and, consequently, the least developed area of research. As a reflection of this apparent methodological deficit, pharmaceutical drugs featuring C-F stereogenic centers constitute less than 1% of all fluorine-containing medicines currently on the market or in clinical development. Here we provide a comprehensive review of current research activity in this area, including such general directions as asymmetric electrophilic fluorination via organocatalytic and transition-metal catalyzed reactions, asymmetric elaboration of fluorine-containing substrates via alkylations, Mannich, Michael, and aldol additions, cross-coupling reactions, and biocatalytic approaches.","1070":"N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become without doubt one of the most exciting and popular species in chemical science due to the ease of their preparation and modularity in stereoelectronic properties. Numerous types of NHCs have been prepared, and various experimental methodologies have been proposed for the study of their electronic properties in order to rationalize reactivities observed. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the most common and popular ones among them. In particular, these include the nickel(0)-based TEP, its rhodium(I) and iridium(I) variants, LEP and related electrochemical methods, the palladium(II)-based HEP, phosphinidene- and selenourea-based methods, as well as the use of direct 1 J(C-H) coupling constants of the precarbene carbon in azolium salts. Each individual method and the underlying principle of detection it utilizes will be critically discussed in terms of strength and weakness. In addition, comprehensive amounts of data from various NHCs are compiled for the purpose of comparison. These are also meant to help the scientist in better understanding their own research data and possibly providing directions for their future research, which rely on the unique electronic properties of NHCs.","1071":"Coding for proteins has been considered the main function of RNA since the \"central dogma\" of biology was proposed. The discovery of noncoding transcripts shed light on additional roles of RNA, ranging from the support of polypeptide synthesis, to the assembly of subnuclear structures, to gene expression modulation. Cellular RNA has therefore been recognized as a central player in often unanticipated biological processes, including genomic stability. This ever-expanding list of functions inspired us to think of RNA as a \"smart\" phone, which has replaced the older obsolete \"cellular\" phone. In this review, we summarize the last two decades of advances in research on the interface between RNA biology and genome stability. We start with an account of the emergence of noncoding RNA, and then we discuss the involvement of RNA in DNA damage signaling and repair, telomere maintenance, and genomic rearrangements. We continue with the depiction of single-molecule RNA detection techniques, and we conclude by illustrating the possibilities of RNA modulation in hopes of creating or improving new therapies. The widespread biological functions of RNA have made this molecule a reoccurring theme in basic and translational research, warranting it the transcendence from classically studied \"cellular\" RNA to \"smart\" RNA.","1072":"Historically, reagent controlled reactions (mechanism controlled reactions) have played a significant role in the asymmetric synthesis of complex structures. In contrast, today's asymmetric synthesis is greatly dependent on substrate directed approaches. In this approach, a polar functional group, namely, a \"directing group\", in the vicinity of the reactive site inside the substrate has been documented to preassociate with the chiral catalyst, which exerts stereodirecting influence by directing the reacting partner toward one of the enantiotopic faces of the reaction center. Those reactions usually proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states and result in extraordinary levels of stereoselection. Within the last four decades, the substrate directed approach has become an indispensible tool for the preparation of complex chiral frameworks starting directly from relatively simple achiral substrate molecules via asymmetric induction or various resolution techniques or both. Likewise, the substrate directed approach has been applied to functionalize enantiopure substrates bearing pre-exisiting stereocenters into complex structures as a single diastereomer. A classical example is Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols in which the free hydroxy function acts as an active anchor to a dimeric Ti-catalyst that controls the stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation process by transferring the oxidant enantioselectively. The principal aim of the present review is to give a general overview of substrate directed asymmetric transformations, a topic that has not yet been documented in the form of a concise review of recently developed approaches. Due to the large number of related applications, only recent advances that have been documented within the last two decades have been reviewed. Furthermore, in the current review, we have mainly highlighted asymmetric reactions that are controlled by abundant and frequently used directing groups such as hydroxy, amide, and sulfonamide groups. In addition, selected examples of a few important substrate-directed chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselective reactions have also been included in this review.","1073":null,"1074":null,"1075":null,"1076":"Intersystem crossing (ISC), formally forbidden within nonrelativistic quantum theory, is the mechanism by which a molecule changes its spin state. It plays an important role in the excited state decay dynamics of many molecular systems and not just those containing heavy elements. In the simplest case, ISC is driven by direct spin-orbit coupling between two states of different multiplicities. This coupling is usually assumed to remain unchanged by vibrational motion. It is also often presumed that spin-allowed radiationless transitions, i.e. internal conversion, and the nonadiabatic coupling that drives them, can be considered separately from ISC and spin-orbit coupling owing to the vastly different time scales upon which these processes are assumed to occur. However, these assumptions are too restrictive. Indeed, the strong mixing brought about by the simultaneous presence of nonadiabatic and spin-orbit coupling means that often the spin, electronic, and vibrational dynamics cannot be described independently. Instead of considering a simple ladder of states, as depicted in a Jablonski diagram, one must consider the more complicated spin-vibronic levels. Despite the basic ideas being outlined in the 1960s, it is only with the advent of high-level theory and femtosecond spectroscopy that the importance of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC in both fundamental as well as applied research fields has been revealed with significant impact across chemistry, physics, and biology. In this review article, we present the theory and fundamental principles of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC. This is followed by empirical rules to estimate the rate of ISC within this regime. The most recent developments in experimental techniques, theoretical methods, and models for the spin-vibronic mechanism are discussed. These concepts are subsequently illustrated with examples, including the ISC mechanisms in transition metal complexes, small organic molecules, and organic chromophores.","1077":"Oxidative addition and reductive elimination are key steps in a wide variety of catalytic reactions mediated by transition-metal complexes. Historically, this reactivity has been considered to be the exclusive domain of d-block elements. However, this paradigm has changed in recent years with the demonstration of transition-metal-like reactivity by main-group compounds. This Review highlights the substantial progress achieved in the past decade for the activation of robust single bonds by main-group compounds and the more recently realized activation of multiple bonds by these elements. We also discuss the significant discovery of reversible activation of single bonds and distinct examples of reductive elimination at main-group element centers. The review consists of three major parts, starting with oxidative addition of single bonds, proceeding to cleavage of multiple bonds, and culminated by the discussion of reversible bond activation and reductive elimination. Within each subsection, the discussion is arranged according to the type of bond being cleaved or formed and considers elements from the left to the right of each period and down each group of the periodic table. The majority of results discussed in this Review come from the past decade; however, earlier reports are also included to ensure completeness.","1078":null,"1079":"Glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses involve the characterization of oligosaccharides (glycans) conjugated to proteins. Glycans are produced through a complicated nontemplate driven process involving the competition of enzymes that extend the nascent chain. The large diversity of structures, the variations in polarity of the individual saccharide residues, and the poor ionization efficiencies of glycans all conspire to make the analysis arguably much more difficult than any other biopolymer. Furthermore, the large number of glycoforms associated with a specific protein site makes it more difficult to characterize than any post-translational modification. Nonetheless, there have been significant progress, and advanced separation and mass spectrometry methods have been at its center and the main reason for the progress. While glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses are still typically available only through highly specialized laboratories, new software and workflow is making it more accessible. This review focuses on the role of mass spectrometry and separation methods in advancing glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses. It describes the current state of the field and progress toward making it more available to the larger scientific community.","1080":"Over the past few decades, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts for efficient energy conversion technologies have been subjects of extensive study. With the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have emerged as some of the most promising candidates for heterogeneous electrocatalysts due to their unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties. Here, we review 2D-nanomaterial-based electrocatalysts for selected electrocatalytic processes. We first discuss the unique advances in 2D electrocatalysts based on different compositions and functions followed by specific design principles. Following this overview, we discuss various 2D electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic processes involved in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle from their fundamental conception to their functional application. We place a significant emphasis on different engineering strategies for 2D nanomaterials and the influence these strategies have on intrinsic material performance, such as electronic properties and adsorption energetics. Finally, we feature the opportunities and challenges ahead for 2D nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts. By considering theoretical calculations, surface characterization, and electrochemical tests, we describe the fundamental relationships between electronic structure, adsorption energy, and apparent activity for a wide variety of 2D electrocatalysts with the goal of providing a better understanding of these emerging nanomaterials at the atomic level.","1081":"","1082":null,"1083":"Capillary electrophoresis has emerged as a powerful approach for carbohydrate analyses since 2014. The method provides high resolution capable of separating carbohydrates by charge-to-size ratio. Principle applications are heavily focused on N-glycans, which are highly relevant to biological therapeutics and biomarker research. Advances in techniques used for N-glycan structural identification include migration time indexing and exoglycosidase and lectin profiling, as well as mass spectrometry. Capillary electrophoresis methods have been developed that are capable of separating glycans with the same monosaccharide sequence but different positional isomers, as well as determining whether monosaccharides composing a glycan are alpha or beta linked. Significant applications of capillary electrophoresis to the analyses of N-glycans in biomarker discovery and biological therapeutics are emphasized with a brief discussion included on carbohydrate analyses of glycosaminoglycans and mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides relevant to food and plant products. Innovative, emerging techniques in the field are highlighted and the future direction of the technology is projected based on the significant contributions of capillary electrophoresis to glycoscience from 2014 to the present as discussed in this review.","1084":"Isoprene carries approximately half of the flux of non-methane volatile organic carbon emitted to the atmosphere by the biosphere. Accurate representation of its oxidation rate and products is essential for quantifying its influence on the abundance of the hydroxyl radical (OH), nitrogen oxide free radicals (NO x), ozone (O3), and, via the formation of highly oxygenated compounds, aerosol. We present a review of recent laboratory and theoretical studies of the oxidation pathways of isoprene initiated by addition of OH, O3, the nitrate radical (NO3), and the chlorine atom. From this review, a recommendation for a nearly complete gas-phase oxidation mechanism of isoprene and its major products is developed. The mechanism is compiled with the aims of providing an accurate representation of the flow of carbon while allowing quantification of the impact of isoprene emissions on HO x and NO x free radical concentrations and of the yields of products known to be involved in condensed-phase processes. Finally, a simplified (reduced) mechanism is developed for use in chemical transport models that retains the essential chemistry required to accurately simulate isoprene oxidation under conditions where it occurs in the atmosphere-above forested regions remote from large NO x emissions.","1085":"","1086":"Nanoparticles exist far from the equilibrium state due to their high surface energy. Nanoparticles are therefore extremely unstable and easily change themselves or react with active substances to reach a relatively stable state in some cases. This causes desired changes or undesired changes to nanoparticles and thus makes them exhibit a high reactivity and a poor stability. Such dual nature (poor stability and high reactivity) of nanoparticles may result in both negative and positive effects for nanoparticle processing. However, the existing studies mainly focus on the high reactivity of nanoparticles, whereas their poor stability has been neglected or considered inconsequential. In fact, in some cases the unstable process, which is derived from the poor stability of nanoparticles, offers an opportunity to design and fabricate unique nanomaterials, such as by chemically transforming the \"captured\" intermediate nanostructures during a changing process, assembling destabilized nanoparticles into larger ordered assemblies, or shrinking\/processing pristine materials into the desired size or shape via selective etching. In this review, we aim to present the stability and reactivity of nanoparticles on three levels: the foundation, concrete manifestations, and applications. We start with a brief introduction of dangling bonds and the surface chemistry of nanoparticles. Then, concrete manifestations of the poor stability and high reactivity of nanoparticles are presented from four perspectives: dispersion stability, thermal stability, structural stability, and chemical stability\/reactivity. Next, we discuss some issues regarding the stability and reactivity of nanomaterials during applications. Finally, conclusions and perspectives on this field are presented.","1087":"The divergent total syntheses of complex natural products from a common intermediate have attracted enormous attention in the chemical community in the past few years because it can improve the efficiency of chemical synthesis. A number of powerful and unified strategies have been developed by emulating the natural biosynthesis or through innovative transformations. This review focuses on the total synthesis of natural products by applying divergent strategies and the literature covering from 2013 to June 2017. On the basis of where the diversity comes from, the examples are grouped into three parts and discussed in detail. In each group, the examples that synthesize natural products belonging to the same subfamily are put together to contrast with one another.","1088":"The vast chemical and structural diversity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) opens up the exciting possibility of \"crystal engineering\" MOFs tailored for particular catalytic or separation applications. Yet the process of reaction discovery, optimization, and scale-up of MOF synthesis remains extremely challenging, presenting significant obstacles to the synthetic realization of many otherwise promising MOF structures. Recently, significant new insights into the fundamental processes governing MOF nucleation and growth, as well as the relationship between reaction parameters and synthetic outcome, have been derived using powerful in situ, time-resolved and\/or mechanistic studies of MOF crystallization. This Review provides a summary and associated critical analysis of the results of these and other related \"direct\" studies of MOF nucleation and growth, with a particular emphasis on the recent advances in instrument technologies that have enabled such studies and on the major hypotheses, theories, and models that have been used to explain MOF formation. We conclude with a summary of the major insights that have been gained from the work summarized in this Review, outlining our own perspective on potential fruitful new directions for investigation.","1089":"Ion pumps perform active transport of ions by using energy. The active transport mechanism can be illustrated by the Panama Canal model, which considers two gates and a gain in energy. The Panama Canal model is consistent with the alternating access model that is used to describe active transport, in which the substrate ion is bound, energized, and released. It was generally accepted that energization occurs only for an ion-bound protein but not for an ion-unbound protein. Light-driven proton and chloride pumps, two of the best studied pumps, are represented by the Panama Canal model. In this case, light absorption takes place for the bound state of ions (proton and chloride ions) in the active center (protonated Schiff base of the retinal chromophore). In contrast, a recently discovered light-driven sodium pump, Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2), is a unique active transporter that does not bind the transport substrate, the sodium ion, in its resting state. The molecular architecture and photoreaction cycle of the light-driven sodium pump are very similar to those of proton and chloride pumps, although sodium ions are actively transported without initial binding. Sodium uptake is a diffusive process, but the presence of two gates allows the unidirectional transport of sodium ions. In this sense, the light-driven sodium pump is also represented by a modified Panama Canal model. Current understanding of the light-driven sodium pump is reviewed.","1090":"While organic electrochemistry can look quite different to a chemist not familiar with the technique, the reactions are at their core organic reactions. As such, they are developed and optimized using the same physical organic chemistry principles employed during the development of any other organic reaction. Certainly, the electron transfer that triggers the reactions can require a consideration of new \"wrinkles\" to those principles, but those considerations are typically minimal relative to the more traditional approaches needed to manipulate the pathways available to the reactive intermediates formed downstream of that electron transfer. In this review, three very different synthetic challenges-the generation and trapping of radical cations, the development of site-selective reactions on microelectrode arrays, and the optimization of current in a paired electrolysis-are used to illustrate this point.","1091":"Bioluminescence is a phenomenon that has fascinated mankind for centuries. Today the phenomenon and its sibling, chemiluminescence, have impacted society with a number of useful applications in fields like analytical chemistry and medicine, just to mention two. In this review, a molecular-orbital perspective is adopted to explain the chemistry behind chemiexcitation in both chemi- and bioluminescence. First, the uncatalyzed thermal dissociation of 1,2-dioxetane is presented and analyzed to explain, for example, the preference for triplet excited product states and increased yield with larger nonreactive substituents. The catalyzed fragmentation reaction and related details are then exemplified with substituted 1,2-dioxetanone species. In particular, the preference for singlet excited product states in that case is explained. The review also examines the diversity of specific solutions both in Nature and in artificial systems and the difficulties in identifying the emitting species and unraveling the color modulation process. The related subject of excited-state chemistry without light absorption is finally discussed. The content of this review should be an inspiration to human design of new molecular systems expressing unique light-emitting properties. An appendix describing the state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods used to study the phenomena serves as a complement.","1092":"In the context of atom economy and low environmental impact, synthesis of amines by an efficient catalytic process is of great importance to produce these building blocks for fine chemical industry. The one-pot hydroaminomethylation of alkenes is a tandem reaction which involves three successive steps under CO\/H2 pressure to perform the catalyzed hydroformylation of the alkene into the corresponding aldehyde followed by its condensation with a N-H function and the catalyzed hydrogenation of the imine\/enamine intermediate into the corresponding saturated amine. Rhodium and more recently ruthenium complexes have been designed to combine high conversions of the reactants and chemoselectivity in the expected amines with high regioselectivity in either the linear or the branched amine. The coordination sphere of the metal according to the presence of ligands, temperature, CO\/H2 partial pressures, and nature of the solvent is essential for complying with these selectivity requirements. The rate of the hydroformylation step needs to be fast with regard to the hydrogenation step. The role of amines in the coordination sphere and water, presumably in the second sphere, on the mechanism requires some more studies. Similarly, the enantioselective synthesis of amine is not yet achieved directly and interrupted processes or use of asymmetric organo-catalyzed reductive amination are efficient synthetic ways for producing chiral amines. The separation of the catalyst from the organic products by biphasic or (semi-) heterogeneized systems and its recycling have been demonstrated in many cases. The present review provides a report of the state of the art in this autotandem hydroaminomethylation catalysis and should open prospects in the design of less expensive and abundant metal complexes for reaching at low cost similar and even superior performances.","1093":null,"1094":"","1095":null,"1096":"Mixed-valent iron [Fe(II)-Fe(III)] minerals such as magnetite and green rust have received a significant amount of attention over recent decades, especially in the environmental sciences. These mineral phases are intrinsic and essential parts of biogeochemical cycling of metals and organic carbon and play an important role regarding the mobility, toxicity, and redox transformation of organic and inorganic pollutants. The formation pathways, mineral properties, and applications of magnetite and green rust are currently active areas of research in geochemistry, environmental mineralogy, geomicrobiology, material sciences, environmental engineering, and environmental remediation. These aspects ultimately dictate the reactivity of magnetite and green rust in the environment, which has important consequences for the application of these mineral phases, for example in remediation strategies. In this review we discuss the properties, occurrence, formation by biotic as well as abiotic pathways, characterization techniques, and environmental applications of magnetite and green rust in the environment. The aim is to present a detailed overview of the key aspects related to these mineral phases which can be used as an important resource for researchers working in a diverse range of fields dealing with mixed-valent iron minerals.","1097":"Over the past decade, we have seen rapid advances in applying nanotechnology in biomedical areas including bioimaging, biodetection, and drug delivery. As an emerging field, DNA nanotechnology offers simple yet powerful design techniques for self-assembly of nanostructures with unique advantages and high potential in enhancing drug targeting and reducing drug toxicity. Various sequence programming and optimization approaches have been developed to design DNA nanostructures with precisely engineered, controllable size, shape, surface chemistry, and function. Potent anticancer drug molecules, including Doxorubicin and CpG oligonucleotides, have been successfully loaded on DNA nanostructures to increase their cell uptake efficiency. These advances have implicated the bright future of DNA nanotechnology-enabled nanomedicine. In this review, we begin with the origin of DNA nanotechnology, followed by summarizing state-of-the-art strategies for the construction of DNA nanostructures and drug payloads delivered by DNA nanovehicles. Further, we discuss the cellular fates of DNA nanostructures as well as challenges and opportunities for DNA nanostructure-based drug delivery.","1098":"Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) are a class of hybrid natural products sharing the mevalonate\/methylerythritol phosphate and polyketide biosynthetic pathways and showing considerable structure and bioactivity diversity. This review discusses the progress of research into the chemistry and biological activity of 421 natural PPAPs in the past 11 years as well as in-depth studies of biological activities and total synthesis of some PPAPs isolated before 2006. We created an online database of all PPAPs known to date at http:\/\/www.chem.uky.edu\/research\/grossman\/PPAPs . Two subclasses of biosynthetically related metabolites, spirocyclic PPAPs with octahydrospiro[cyclohexan-1,5'-indene]-2,4,6-trione core and complicated PPAPs produced by intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloadditions of MPAPs, are brought into the PPAP family. Some PPAPs' relative or absolute configurations are reassigned or critically discussed, and the confusing trivial names in PPAPs investigations are clarified. Pharmacologic studies have revealed a new molecular mechanism whereby hyperforin and its derivatives regulate neurotransmitter levels by activating TRPC6 as well as the antitumor mechanism of garcinol and its analogues. The antineoplastic potential of some type B PPAPs such as oblongifolin C and guttiferone K has increased significantly. As a result of the recent appearances of innovative synthetic methods and strategies, the total syntheses of 22 natural PPAPs including hyperforin, garcinol, and plukenetione A have been accomplished.","1099":"Cross-couplings and related reactions are a class of highly efficient synthetic protocols that are generally promoted by molecular Pd species as catalysts. However, catalysts based on more or less highly dispersed Pd metal have been also employed for this purpose, and their use, which was largely limited to the Heck reaction until the turn of the century, has been extended in recent years to most reactions of this class. This review provides a critical overview on these recent applications of Pd metal catalysts. Particular attention is devoted to the discussion of the mechanistic pathways that have been proposed to explain the catalytic role of Pd metal. Furthermore, the most outstanding Pd metal based catalytic systems that have emerged are illustrated, together with the development of novel approaches to boost the reactivity of Pd metal. A section summarizing the current industrial applications of Pd metal catalyzed reactions of this kind concludes the review.","1100":"Nanowires supporting propagating surface plasmons can function as nanowaveguides to realize the light guiding with field confinement beyond the diffraction limit, providing fundamental building blocks for nanophotonic integrated circuits. This review covers the recent developments of plasmon waveguiding in nanowires, mainly including plasmon waveguiding in metal nanowires, coupling of nanowire plasmons and emitters, hybrid nanowire waveguides and plasmonic gain, and nanowire photonic devices. We first introduce the main techniques for fabricating metal nanowires, the plasmon modes in metal nanowires and the excitation\/detection methods. We then discuss the fundamental properties of plasmon propagation and emission, including zigzag, chiral and spin-dependent propagation, mode conversion, loss and propagation length, group velocity, terminal emission, and leaky radiation. Then the interactions between nanowires and emitters are reviewed, especially the coupling of single nanowires and single quantum emitters. Finally, we briefly introduce the hybrid nanowire waveguide composed of a semiconductor nanowire and a metal film with an intervening thin insulator and highlight a few nanophotonic devices based on plasmonic nanowire networks or plasmonic-photonic hybrid nanowire structures.","1101":"This review is focused on the enantioselective synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyran derivatives, whose importance as chiral building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive molecules and natural products is well established. The review analyzes the different synthetic strategies by grouping them as a function of the atom numbers of the reagents involved. Starting from the classical [4 + 2] and [2 + 4] approaches, the [3 + 3], [5 + 1], and [6] strategies have been sequentially analyzed, and for each of them, the asymmetry induced by both chiral metal complexes and different kinds of organocatalysts has been examined. More than 400 papers have been reviewed, whose results have been described in the highest synthetic manner, in the attempt to emphasize the mechanism of the chirality transfer from the chiral messengers to the reaction products. This analysis allows the great flexibility of the diverse catalytic systems, the complementary of the results obtained from the different reaction pathways, and the very high level of control of the achievable molecular complexity to be evidenced.","1102":"","1103":"Hydrodynamic phenomena are ubiquitous in living organisms and can be used to manipulate cells or emulate physiological microenvironments experienced in vivo. Hydrodynamic effects influence multiple cellular properties and processes, including cell morphology, intracellular processes, cell-cell signaling cascades and reaction kinetics, and play an important role at the single-cell, multicellular, and organ level. Selected hydrodynamic effects can also be leveraged to control mechanical stresses, analyte transport, as well as local temperature within cellular microenvironments. With a better understanding of fluid mechanics at the micrometer-length scale and the advent of microfluidic technologies, a new generation of experimental tools that provide control over cellular microenvironments and emulate physiological conditions with exquisite accuracy is now emerging. Accordingly, we believe that it is timely to assess the concepts underlying hydrodynamic control of cellular microenvironments and their applications and provide some perspective on the future of such tools in in vitro cell-culture models. Generally, we describe the interplay between living cells, hydrodynamic stressors, and fluid flow-induced effects imposed on the cells. This interplay results in a broad range of chemical, biological, and physical phenomena in and around cells. More specifically, we describe and formulate the underlying physics of hydrodynamic phenomena affecting both adhered and suspended cells. Moreover, we provide an overview of representative studies that leverage hydrodynamic effects in the context of single-cell studies within microfluidic systems.","1104":"This review considers noncovalent bonds between divalent chalcogen centers. In the first part we present X-ray data taken from the solid state structures of dimethyl- and diphenyl-dichalcogenides as well as oligoalkynes kept by alkyl-sulfur, -selenium, and -tellurium groups. Furthermore, we analyzed the solid state structures of medium sized (12-24 ring size) selenium coronands and medium to large rings with alkyne and alkene units between two chalcogen centers. The crystal structures of the cyclic structures revealed columnar stacks with close contacts between neighboring rings via noncovalent interactions between the chalcogen centers. To get larger space within the cavities, rings with diyne units between the chalcogen centers were used. These molecules showed channel-like structures in the solid state. The flexibility of the rings permits inclusion of guest molecules such as five-membered heterocycles and aromatic six-membered rings. In the second part we discuss the results of quantum chemical calculations. To treat properly the noncovalent bonding between chalcogens, we use diffuse augmented split valence basis sets in combination with electron correlation methods. Our model substances were 16 dimers consisting of two Me-X-Me (X = O, S, Se, Te) pairs and dimers of Me-X-Me\/Me-X-CN (X = O, S, Se, Te) pairs. The calculations show the anticipated increase of the interaction energy from (Me-O-Me)2 (-2.15 kcal\/mol) to (Me-O-Me\/Me-Te-CN) (-6.59 kcal\/mol). An analysis by the NBO method reveals that in the case of the chalcogen centers O and S the hydrogen bridges between the molecules dominate. However, in the case of Se and Te the major bonding between the pairs originates from dispersion forces between the chalcogen centers. It varies between -1.7 and -4.0 kcal\/mol.","1105":"Plasmonic nanostructures are extensively used building blocks for engineering optical materials and device architectures. Plasmonic nanocomposites (pNCs) are an emerging class of materials that integrate these nanostructures into hierarchical and often multifunctional systems. These pNCs can be highly customizable by modifying both the plasmonic and matrix components, as well as by controlling the nano- to macroscale morphology of the composite as a whole. Assembly at the nanoscale plays a particularly important role in the design of pNCs that exhibit complex or responsive optical function. Due to their scalability and tunability, pNCs provide a versatile platform for engineering new plasmonic materials and for facile integration into optoelectronic device architectures. This review provides a comprehensive survey of recent achievements in pNC structure, design, fabrication, and optical function, along with some examples of their application in optoelectronics and sensing.","1106":"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key component of biological processes and energy technologies. This Review provides a comprehensive report of soluble molecular catalysts and electrocatalysts for the ORR. The precise synthetic control and relative ease of mechanistic study for homogeneous molecular catalysts, as compared to heterogeneous materials or surface-adsorbed species, enables a detailed understanding of the individual steps of ORR catalysis. Thus, the Review places particular emphasis on ORR mechanism and thermodynamics. First, the thermochemistry of oxygen reduction and the factors influencing ORR efficiency are described to contextualize the discussion of catalytic studies that follows. Reports of ORR catalysis are presented in terms of their mechanism, with separate sections for catalysis proceeding via initial outer- and inner-sphere electron transfer to O2. The rates and selectivities (for production of H2O2 vs H2O) of these catalysts are provided, along with suggested methods for accurately comparing catalysts of different metals and ligand scaffolds that were examined under different experimental conditions.","1107":"Post-translational acetylation of lysine residues has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in all eukaryotic organisms. Originally discovered in 1963 as a unique modification of histones, acetylation marks are now found on thousands of nonhistone proteins located in virtually every cellular compartment. Here we summarize key findings in the field of protein acetylation over the past 20 years with a focus on recent discoveries in nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial compartments. Collectively, these findings have elevated protein acetylation as a major post-translational modification, underscoring its physiological relevance in gene regulation, cell signaling, metabolism, and disease.","1108":"Despite the dedicated search for novel catalysts for fuel cell applications, the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of materials has not improved significantly over the past decade. Here, we review the role of theory in understanding the ORR mechanism and highlight the descriptor-based approaches that have been used to identify catalysts with increased activity. Specifically, by showing that the performance of the commonly studied materials (e.g., metals, alloys, carbons, etc.) is limited by unfavorable scaling relationships (for binding energies of reaction intermediates), we present a number of alternative strategies that may lead to the design and discovery of more promising materials for ORR.","1109":"A growing subset of metalloenzymes activates dioxygen with nonheme diiron active sites to effect substrate oxidations that range from the hydroxylation of methane and the desaturation of fatty acids to the deformylation of fatty aldehydes to produce alkanes and the six-electron oxidation of aminoarenes to nitroarenes in the biosynthesis of antibiotics. A common feature of their reaction mechanisms is the formation of O2 adducts that evolve into more reactive derivatives such as diiron(II,III)-superoxo, diiron(III)-peroxo, diiron(III,IV)-oxo, and diiron(IV)-oxo species, which carry out particular substrate oxidation tasks. In this review, we survey the various enzymes belonging to this unique subset and the mechanisms by which substrate oxidation is carried out. We examine the nature of the reactive intermediates, as revealed by X-ray crystallography and the application of various spectroscopic methods and their associated reactivity. We also discuss the structural and electronic properties of the model complexes that have been found to mimic salient aspects of these enzyme active sites. Much has been learned in the past 25 years, but key questions remain to be answered.","1110":"Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) that results in resonant absorption, scattering, and near field enhancement around the NC can be tuned across a wide optical spectral range from visible to far-infrared by synthetically varying doping level, and post synthetically via chemical oxidation and reduction, photochemical control, and electrochemical control. In this review, we will discuss the fundamental electromagnetic dynamics governing light matter interaction in plasmonic semiconductor NCs and the realization of various distinctive physical properties made possible by the advancement of colloidal synthesis routes to such NCs. Here, we will illustrate how free carrier dielectric properties are induced in various semiconductor materials including metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, metal nitrides, silicon, and other materials. We will highlight the applicability and limitations of the Drude model as applied to semiconductors considering the complex band structures and crystal structures that predominate and quantum effects that emerge at nonclassical sizes. We will also emphasize the impact of dopant hybridization with bands of the host lattice as well as the interplay of shape and crystal structure in determining the LSPR characteristics of semiconductor NCs. To illustrate the discussion regarding both physical and synthetic aspects of LSPR-active NCs, we will focus on metal oxides with substantial consideration also of copper chalcogenide NCs, with select examples drawn from the literature on other doped semiconductor materials. Furthermore, we will discuss the promise that LSPR in doped semiconductor NCs holds for a wide range of applications such as infrared spectroscopy, energy-saving technologies like smart windows and waste heat management, biomedical applications including therapy and imaging, and optical applications like two photon upconversion, enhanced luminesence, and infrared metasurfaces.","1111":null,"1112":"In this Review article, we systematically summarize the design and applications of various kinds of long-lived emissive probes for bioimaging and biosensing via time-resolved photoluminescence techniques. The probes reviewed, including lanthanides, transition-metal complexes, organic dyes, carbon and silicon nanoparticles, metal clusters, and persistent phosphores, exhibit longer luminescence lifetimes than that of autofluorescence from biological tissue and organs. When these probes are internalized into living cells or animals, time-gated photoluminescence imaging selectively collects long-lived signals for intensity analysis, while photoluminescence lifetime imaging reports the decay details of each pixel. Since the long-lived signals are differentiated from autofluorescence in the time domain, the imaging contrast and sensing sensitivity are remarkably improved. The future prospects and challenges in this rapidly growing field are addressed.","1113":"Advances in solid state white lighting technologies witness the explosive development of phosphor materials (down-conversion luminescent materials). A large amount of evidence has demonstrated the revolutionary role of the emerging nitride phosphors in producing superior white light-emitting diodes for lighting and display applications. The structural and compositional versatility together with the unique local coordination environments enable nitride materials to have compelling luminescent properties such as abundant emission colors, controllable photoluminescence spectra, high conversion efficiency, and small thermal quenching\/degradation. Here, we summarize the state-of-art progress on this novel family of luminescent materials and discuss the topics of materials discovery, crystal chemistry, structure-related luminescence, temperature-dependent luminescence, and spectral tailoring. We also overview different types of nitride phosphors and their applications in solid state lighting, including general illumination, backlighting, and laser-driven lighting. Finally, the challenges and outlooks in this type of promising down-conversion materials are highlighted.","1114":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are diverse, nanoscale membrane vesicles actively released by cells. Similar-sized vesicles can be further classified (e.g., exosomes, microvesicles) based on their biogenesis, size, and biophysical properties. Although initially thought to be cellular debris, and thus under-appreciated, EVs are now increasingly recognized as important vehicles of intercellular communication and circulating biomarkers for disease diagnoses and prognosis. Despite their clinical potential, the lack of sensitive preparatory and analytical technologies for EVs poses a barrier to clinical translation. New analytical platforms including molecular ones are thus actively being developed to address these challenges. Recent advances in the field are expected to have far-reaching impact in both basic and translational studies. This article aims to present a comprehensive and critical overview of emerging analytical technologies for EV detection and their clinical applications.","1115":"A comprehensive review of recent advances in the field of oxygen reduction electrocatalysis utilizing nonprecious metal (NPM) catalysts is presented. Progress in the synthesis and characterization of pyrolyzed catalysts, based primarily on the transition metals Fe and Co with sources of N and C, is summarized. Several synthetic strategies to improve the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highlighted. Recent work to explain the active-site structures and the ORR mechanism on pyrolyzed NPM catalysts is discussed. Additionally, the recent application of Cu-based catalysts for the ORR is reviewed. Suggestions and direction for future research to develop and understand NPM catalysts with enhanced ORR activity are provided.","1116":"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing research interest because of the abundant choice of materials with diverse and tunable electronic, optical, and chemical properties. Moreover, 2D material based heterostructures combining several individual 2D materials provide unique platforms to create an almost infinite number of materials and show exotic physical phenomena as well as new properties and applications. To achieve these high expectations, methods for the scalable preparation of 2D materials and 2D heterostructures of high quality and low cost must be developed. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a powerful method which may meet the above requirements, and has been extensively used to grow 2D materials and their heterostructures in recent years, despite several challenges remaining. In this review of the challenges in the CVD growth of 2D materials, we highlight recent advances in the controlled growth of single crystal 2D materials, with an emphasis on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. We provide insight into the growth mechanisms of single crystal 2D domains and the key technologies used to realize wafer-scale growth of continuous and homogeneous 2D films which are important for practical applications. Meanwhile, strategies to design and grow various kinds of 2D material based heterostructures are thoroughly discussed. The applications of CVD-grown 2D materials and their heterostructures in electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, flexible devices, and electrocatalysis are also discussed. Finally, we suggest solutions to these challenges and ideas concerning future developments in this emerging field.","1117":"The interaction between light and matter can be controlled efficiently by structuring materials at a length scale shorter than the wavelength of interest. With the goal to build optical devices that operate at the nanoscale, plasmonics has established itself as a discipline, where near-field effects of electromagnetic waves created in the vicinity of metallic surfaces can give rise to a variety of novel phenomena and fascinating applications. As research on plasmonics has emerged from the optics and solid-state communities, most laboratories employ top-down lithography to implement their nanophotonic designs. In this review, we discuss the recent, successful efforts of employing self-assembled DNA nanostructures as scaffolds for creating advanced plasmonic architectures. DNA self-assembly exploits the base-pairing specificity of nucleic acid sequences and allows for the nanometer-precise organization of organic molecules but also for the arrangement of inorganic particles in space. Bottom-up self-assembly thus bypasses many of the limitations of conventional fabrication methods. As a consequence, powerful tools such as DNA origami have pushed the boundaries of nanophotonics and new ways of thinking about plasmonic designs are on the rise.","1118":"Current tuberculosis (TB) drug development efforts are not sufficient to end the global TB epidemic. Recent efforts have focused on the development of whole-cell screening assays because biochemical, target-based inhibitor screens during the last two decades have not delivered new TB drugs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, encounters diverse microenvironments and can be found in a variety of metabolic states in the human host. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of Mtb infection, no single model can fully recapitulate the in vivo conditions in which Mtb is found in TB patients, and there is no single \"standard\" screening condition to generate hit compounds for TB drug development. However, current screening assays have become more sophisticated as researchers attempt to mirror the complexity of TB disease in the laboratory. In this review, we describe efforts using surrogates and engineered strains of Mtb to focus screens on specific targets. We explain model culture systems ranging from carbon starvation to hypoxia, and combinations thereof, designed to represent the microenvironment which Mtb encounters in the human body. We outline ongoing efforts to model Mtb infection in the lung granuloma. We assess these different models, their ability to generate hit compounds, and needs for further TB drug development, to provide direction for future TB drug discovery.","1119":"The functionality of liquid-liquid interfaces formed between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) can be markedly enhanced by modification with supramolecular assemblies or solid nanomaterials. The focus of this Review is recent progress involving ITIES modified with floating assemblies of gold nanoparticles or \"nanofilms\". Experimental methods to controllably modify liquid-liquid interfaces with gold nanofilms are detailed. Also, we outline an array of techniques to characterize these gold nanofilms in terms of their physiochemical properties (such as reflectivity, conductivity, catalytic activity, or plasmonic properties) and physical interfacial properties (for example, interparticle spacing and immersion depth at the interface). The ability of floating gold nanofilms to impact a diverse range of fields is demonstrated: in particular, redox electrocatalysis, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensors, and electrovariable optical devices. Finally, perspectives on applications beyond the state-of-the-art are provided.","1120":"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted tremendous research interest since the breakthrough of graphene. Their unique optical, electronic, and mechanical properties hold great potential for harnessing them as key components in novel applications for electronics and optoelectronics. Their atomic thickness and exposed huge surface even make them highly designable and manipulable, leading to the extensive application potentials. What's more, after acquiring the qualification for being the candidate for next-generation devices, the assembly of 2D materials monomers into mass or ordered structure is also of great importance, which will determine their ultimate industrialization. By designing the monomers and regulating their assembling behavior, the exploration of 2D materials toward the next-generation circuits can be spectacularly achieved. In this review, we will first overview the emerging 2D materials and then offer a clear guideline of varied physical and chemical strategies for tuning their properties. Furthermore, assembly strategies of 2D materials will also be included. Finally, challenges and outlooks in this promising field are featured on the basis of its current progress.","1121":"Nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and group II intron self-splicing both proceed by two-step transesterification reactions via a lariat intron intermediate. Recently determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of catalytically active spliceosomes revealed the RNA-based catalytic core and showed how pre-mRNA substrates and reaction products are positioned in the active site. These findings highlight a strong structural similarity to the group II intron active site, strengthening the notion that group II introns and spliceosomes evolved from a common ancestor. Prp8, the largest and most conserved protein in the spliceosome, cradles the active site RNA. Prp8 and group II intron maturase have a similar domain architecture, suggesting that they also share a common evolutionary origin. The interactions between maturase and key group II intron RNA elements, such as the exon-binding loop and domains V and VI, are recapitulated in the interactions between Prp8 and key elements in the spliceosome's catalytic RNA core. Structural comparisons suggest that the extensive RNA scaffold of the group II intron was gradually replaced by proteins as the spliceosome evolved. A plausible model of spliceosome evolution is discussed.","1122":"The emergence of single-molecule (SM) fluorescence techniques has opened up a vast new toolbox for exploring the molecular basis of life. The ability to monitor individual biomolecules in real time enables complex, dynamic folding pathways to be interrogated without the averaging effect of ensemble measurements. In parallel, modern biology has been revolutionized by our emerging understanding of the many functions of RNA. In this comprehensive review, we survey SM fluorescence approaches and discuss how the application of these tools to RNA and RNA-containing macromolecular complexes in vitro has yielded significant insights into the underlying biology. Topics covered include the three-dimensional folding landscapes of a plethora of isolated RNA molecules, their assembly and interactions in RNA-protein complexes, and the relation of these properties to their biological functions. In all of these examples, the use of SM fluorescence methods has revealed critical information beyond the reach of ensemble averages.","1123":"","1124":"Flow-induced crystallization (FIC) is a typical nonequilibrium phase transition and a core industry subject for the largest group of commercially useful polymeric materials: semicrystalline polymers. A fundamental understanding of FIC can benefit the research of nonequilibrium ordering in matter systems and help to tailor the ultimate properties of polymeric materials. Concerning the crystallization process, flow can accelerate the kinetics by orders of magnitude and induce the formation of oriented crystallites like shish-kebab, which are associated with the major influences of flow on nucleation, that is, raised nucleation density and oriented nuclei. The topic of FIC has been studied for more than half a century. Recently, there have been many developments in experimental approaches, such as synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering, ultrafast X-ray detectors with a time resolution down to the order of milliseconds, and novel laboratory devices to mimic the severe flow field close to real processing conditions. By a combination of these advanced methods, the evolution process of FIC can be revealed more precisely (with higher time resolution and on more length scales) and quantitatively. The new findings are challenging the classical interpretations and theories that were mostly derived from quiescent or mild-flow conditions, and they are triggering the reconsideration of FIC foundations. This review mainly summarizes experimental results, advances in physical understanding, and discussions on the multiscale and multistep nature of oriented nuclei induced by strong flow. The multiscale structures include segmental conformation, packing of conformational ordering, deformation on the whole-chain scale, and macroscopic aggregation of crystallites. The multistep process involves conformation transition, isotropic-nematic transition, density fluctuation (or phase separation), formation of precursors, and shish-kebab crystallites, which are possible ordering processes during nucleation. Furthermore, some theoretical progress and modeling efforts are also included.","1125":"This review focuses on the type A cytochrome c oxidases (C cO), which are found in all mitochondria and also in several aerobic bacteria. C cO catalyzes the respiratory reduction of dioxygen (O2) to water by an intriguing mechanism, the details of which are fairly well understood today as a result of research for over four decades. Perhaps even more intriguingly, the membrane-bound C cO couples the O2 reduction chemistry to translocation of protons across the membrane, thus contributing to generation of the electrochemical proton gradient that is used to drive the synthesis of ATP as catalyzed by the rotary ATP synthase in the same membrane. After reviewing the structure of the core subunits of C cO, the active site, and the transfer paths of electrons, protons, oxygen, and water, we describe the states of the catalytic cycle and point out the few remaining uncertainties. Finally, we discuss the mechanism of proton translocation and the controversies in that area that still prevail.","1126":"","1127":"Lignin, a major component of lignocellulose, is the largest source of aromatic building blocks on the planet and harbors great potential to serve as starting material for the production of biobased products. Despite the initial challenges associated with the robust and irregular structure of lignin, the valorization of this intriguing aromatic biopolymer has come a long way: recently, many creative strategies emerged that deliver defined products via catalytic or biocatalytic depolymerization in good yields. The purpose of this review is to provide insight into these novel approaches and the potential application of such emerging new structures for the synthesis of biobased polymers or pharmacologically active molecules. Existing strategies for functionalization or defunctionalization of lignin-based compounds are also summarized. Following the whole value chain from raw lignocellulose through depolymerization to application whenever possible, specific lignin-based compounds emerge that could be in the future considered as potential lignin-derived platform chemicals.","1128":"Biological cells are complex living machines that have garnered significant attention for their potential to serve as a new generation of therapeutic and delivery agents. Because of their secretion, differentiation, and homing activities, therapeutic cells have tremendous potential to treat or even cure various diseases and injuries that have defied conventional therapeutic strategies. Therapeutic cells can be systemically or locally transplanted. In addition, with their ability to express receptors that bind specific tissue markers, cells are being studied as nano- or microsized drug carriers capable of targeted transport. Depending on the therapeutic targets, these cells may be clustered to promote intercellular adhesion. Despite some impressive results with preclinical studies, there remain several obstacles to their broader development, such as a limited ability to control their transport, engraftment, secretion and to track them in vivo. Additionally, creating a particular spatial organization of therapeutic cells remains difficult. Efforts have recently emerged to resolve these challenges by engineering cell surfaces with a myriad of bioactive molecules, nanoparticles, and microparticles that, in turn, improve the therapeutic efficacy of cells. This review article assesses the various technologies developed to engineer the cell surfaces. The review ends with future considerations that should be taken into account to further advance the quality of cell surface engineering.","1129":"Over time, organisms have evolved strategies to cope with the abundance of dioxygen on Earth. Oxygen-utilizing enzymes tightly control the reactions involving O2 mostly by modulating the reactivity of their cofactors. Flavins are extremely versatile cofactors that are capable of undergoing redox reactions by accepting either one electron or two electrons, alternating between the oxidized and the reduced states. The physical and chemical principles of flavin-based chemistry have been investigated widely. In the following pages we summarize the state of the art on a key area of research in flavin enzymology: the molecular basis for the activation of O2 by flavin-dependent oxidases and monooxygenases. In general terms, oxidases use O2 as an electron acceptor to produce H2O2, while monooxygenases activate O2 by forming a flavin intermediate and insert an oxygen atom into the substrate. First, we analyze how O2 reaches the flavin cofactor embedded in the protein matrix through dedicated access pathways. Then we approach O2 activation from the perspective of the monooxygenases, their preferred intermediate, the C(4a)-(hydro)peroxyflavin, and the cases in which other intermediates have been described. Finally, we focus on understanding how the architectures developed in the active sites of oxidases promote O2 activation and which other factors operate in its reactivity.","1130":"Rapid progress in genome sequencing technology has put us firmly into a postgenomic era. A key challenge in biomedical research is harnessing genome sequence to fulfill the promise of personalized medicine. This Review describes how genome sequencing has enabled the identification of disease-causing biomolecules and how these data have been converted into chemical probes of function, preclinical lead modalities, and ultimately U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. In particular, we focus on the use of oligonucleotide-based modalities to target disease-causing RNAs; small molecules that target DNA, RNA, or protein; the rational repurposing of known therapeutic modalities; and the advantages of pharmacogenetics. Lastly, we discuss the remaining challenges and opportunities in the direct utilization of genome sequence to enable design of medicines.","1131":"Charged and polar groups, through forming ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, and other less specific electrostatic interactions, impart important properties to proteins. Modulation of the charges on the amino acids, e.g., by pH and by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, have significant effects such as protein denaturation and switch-like response of signal transduction networks. This review aims to present a unifying theme among the various effects of protein charges and polar groups. Simple models will be used to illustrate basic ideas about electrostatic interactions in proteins, and these ideas in turn will be used to elucidate the roles of electrostatic interactions in protein structure, folding, binding, condensation, and related biological functions. In particular, we will examine how charged side chains are spatially distributed in various types of proteins and how electrostatic interactions affect thermodynamic and kinetic properties of proteins. Our hope is to capture both important historical developments and recent experimental and theoretical advances in quantifying electrostatic contributions of proteins.","1132":"The utilization of CO2 via electrochemical reduction constitutes a promising approach toward production of value-added chemicals or fuels using intermittent renewable energy sources. For this purpose, molecular electrocatalysts are frequently studied and the recent progress both in tuning of the catalytic properties and in mechanistic understanding is truly remarkable. While in earlier years research efforts were focused on complexes with rare metal centers such as Re, Ru, and Pd, the focus has recently shifted toward earth-abundant transition metals such as Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. By application of appropriate ligands, these metals have been rendered more than competitive for CO2 reduction compared to the heavier homologues. In addition, the important roles of the second and outer coordination spheres in the catalytic processes have become apparent, and metal-ligand cooperativity has recently become a well-established tool for further tuning of the catalytic behavior. Surprising advances have also been made with very simple organocatalysts, although the mechanisms behind their reactivity are not yet entirely understood. Herein, the developments of the last three decades in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with homogeneous catalysts are reviewed. A discussion of the underlying mechanistic principles is included along with a treatment of the experimental and computational techniques for mechanistic studies and catalyst benchmarking. Important catalyst families are discussed in detail with regard to mechanistic aspects, and recent advances in the field are highlighted.","1133":"The borrowing hydrogen (BH) principle, also called hydrogen auto-transfer, is a powerful approach which combines transfer hydrogenation (avoiding the direct use of molecular hydrogen) with one or more intermediate reactions to synthesize more complex molecules without the need for tedious separation or isolation processes. The strategy which usually relies on three steps, (i) dehydrogenation, (ii) intermediate reaction, and (iii) hydrogenation, is an excellent and well-recognized process from the synthetic, economic, and environmental point of view. In this context, the objective of the present review is to give a global overview on the topic starting from those contributions published prior to the emergence of the BH concept to the most recent and current research under the term of BH catalysis. Two main subareas of the topic (homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis) have been identified, from which three subheadings based on the source of the electrophile (alkanes, alcohols, and amines) have been considered. Then the type of bond being formed (carbon-carbon and carbon heteroatom) has been taken into account to end-up with the intermediate reaction working in tandem with the metal-catalyzed hydrogenation\/dehydrogenation step. The review has been completed with the more recent advances in asymmetric catalysis using the BH strategy.","1134":"","1135":"","1136":"Sustainable solvents are a topic of growing interest in both the research community and the chemical industry due to a growing awareness of the impact of solvents on pollution, energy usage, and contributions to air quality and climate change. Solvent losses represent a major portion of organic pollution, and solvent removal represents a large proportion of process energy consumption. To counter these issues, a range of greener or more sustainable solvents have been proposed and developed over the past three decades. Much of the focus has been on the environmental credentials of the solvent itself, although how a substance is deployed is as important to sustainability as what it is made from. In this Review, we consider several aspects of the most prominent sustainable organic solvents in use today, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents, supercritical fluids, switchable solvents, liquid polymers, and renewable solvents. We examine not only the performance of each class of solvent within the context of the reactions or extractions for which it is employed, but also give consideration to the wider context of the process and system within which the solvent is deployed. A wide range of technical, economic, and environmental factors are considered, giving a more complete picture of the current status of sustainable solvent research and development.","1137":"With both catalytic and genetic functions, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is perhaps the most pluripotent chemical species in molecular biology, and its functions are intimately linked to its structure and dynamics. Computer simulations, and in particular atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), allow structural dynamics of biomolecular systems to be investigated with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We here provide a comprehensive overview of the fast-developing field of MD simulations of RNA molecules. We begin with an in-depth, evaluatory coverage of the most fundamental methodological challenges that set the basis for the future development of the field, in particular, the current developments and inherent physical limitations of the atomistic force fields and the recent advances in a broad spectrum of enhanced sampling methods. We also survey the closely related field of coarse-grained modeling of RNA systems. After dealing with the methodological aspects, we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides to investigations of the entire ribosome. Our review encompasses tetranucleotides, tetraloops, a number of small RNA motifs, A-helix RNA, kissing-loop complexes, the TAR RNA element, the decoding center and other important regions of the ribosome, as well as assorted others systems. Extended sections are devoted to RNA-ion interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches, and protein\/RNA complexes. Our overview is written for as broad of an audience as possible, aiming to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary bridge between computation and experiment, together with a perspective on the future of the field.","1138":"Protein lipidation, including cysteine prenylation, N-terminal glycine myristoylation, cysteine palmitoylation, and serine and lysine fatty acylation, occurs in many proteins in eukaryotic cells and regulates numerous biological pathways, such as membrane trafficking, protein secretion, signal transduction, and apoptosis. We provide a comprehensive review of protein lipidation, including descriptions of proteins known to be modified and the functions of the modifications, the enzymes that control them, and the tools and technologies developed to study them. We also highlight key questions about protein lipidation that remain to be answered, the challenges associated with answering such questions, and possible solutions to overcome these challenges.","1139":"As a result of the adaptation of life to an aerobic environment, nature has evolved a panoply of metalloproteins for oxidative metabolism and protection against reactive oxygen species. Despite the diverse structures and functions of these proteins, they share common mechanistic grounds. An open-shell transition metal like iron or copper is employed to interact with O2 and its derived intermediates such as hydrogen peroxide to afford a variety of metal-oxygen intermediates. These reactive intermediates, including metal-superoxo, -(hydro)peroxo, and high-valent metal-oxo species, are the basis for the various biological functions of O2-utilizing metalloproteins. Collectively, these processes are called oxygen activation. Much of our understanding of the reactivity of these reactive intermediates has come from the study of heme-containing proteins and related metalloporphyrin compounds. These studies not only have deepened our understanding of various functions of heme proteins, such as O2 storage and transport, degradation of reactive oxygen species, redox signaling, and biological oxygenation, etc., but also have driven the development of bioinorganic chemistry and biomimetic catalysis. In this review, we survey the range of O2 activation processes mediated by heme proteins and model compounds with a focus on recent progress in the characterization and reactivity of important iron-oxygen intermediates. Representative reactions initiated by these reactive intermediates as well as some context from prior decades will also be presented. We will discuss the fundamental mechanistic features of these transformations and delineate the underlying structural and electronic factors that contribute to the spectrum of reactivities that has been observed in nature as well as those that have been invented using these paradigms. Given the recent developments in biocatalysis for non-natural chemistries and the renaissance of radical chemistry in organic synthesis, we envision that new enzymatic and synthetic transformations will emerge based on the radical processes mediated by metalloproteins and their synthetic analogs.","1140":"The aryl C-glycoside structure is, among the plenty of biologically active natural products, one of the distinct motifs embedded. Because of the potential bioactivity as well as the synthetic challenges, these structures have attracted considerable interest, and extensive research toward the total synthesis has been performed. This Review focuses on the synthetic strategies and tactics employed in the total synthesis of this class of natural products. The Introduction describes the historical background, structural features, and synthetic problems associated with aryl C-glycoside natural products. Next the Review summarizes the methods for constructing the aryl C-glycoside bonds. Completed total syntheses-and, in some cases, selected examples of incomplete syntheses-of natural aryl C-glycosides are also summarized. Finally described are the strategies for constructing polycyclic structures, which were utilized in the total syntheses.","1141":"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are germline-enriched small RNAs that control transposons to maintain genome integrity. To achieve this, upon being processed from piRNA precursors, most of which are transcripts of intergenic piRNA clusters, piRNAs bind PIWI proteins, germline-specific Argonaute proteins, to form effector complexes. The mechanism of this piRNA-mediated transposon silencing pathway is fundamentally similar to that of siRNA\/miRNA-dependent gene silencing in that a small RNA guides its partner Argonaute protein to target gene transcripts for repression via RNA-RNA base pairing. However, the uniqueness of this piRNA pathway has emerged through intensive genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and structural investigations. Here, we review the studies that elucidated the piRNA pathway, mainly in Drosophila, by describing both historical and recent progress. Studies in other species that have made important contributions to the field are also described.","1142":null,"1143":"Proteases enzymatically hydrolyze peptide bonds in substrate proteins, resulting in a widespread, irreversible posttranslational modification of the protein's structure and biological function. Often regarded as a mere degradative mechanism in destruction of proteins or turnover in maintaining physiological homeostasis, recent research in the field of degradomics has led to the recognition of two main yet unexpected concepts. First, that targeted, limited proteolytic cleavage events by a wide repertoire of proteases are pivotal regulators of most, if not all, physiological and pathological processes. Second, an unexpected in vivo abundance of stable cleaved proteins revealed pervasive, functionally relevant protein processing in normal and diseased tissue-from 40 to 70% of proteins also occur in vivo as distinct stable proteoforms with undocumented N- or C-termini, meaning these proteoforms are stable functional cleavage products, most with unknown functional implications. In this Review, we discuss the structural biology aspects and mechanisms of catalysis by different protease classes. We also provide an overview of biological pathways that utilize specific proteolytic cleavage as a precision control mechanism in protein quality control, stability, localization, and maturation, as well as proteolytic cleavage as a mediator in signaling pathways. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive overview of analytical methods and approaches to study activity and substrates of proteolytic enzymes in relevant biological models, both historical and focusing on state of the art proteomics techniques in the field of degradomics research.","1144":"Metal-exchanged zeolites are a class of heterogeneous catalysts that perform important functions ranging from selective hydrocarbon oxidation to remediation of NO x pollutants. Among these, copper and iron zeolites are remarkably reactive, hydroxylating methane and benzene selectively at low temperature to form methanol and phenol, respectively. In these systems, reactivity occurs at well-defined molecular transition metal active sites, and in this review we discuss recent advances in the spectroscopic characterization of these active sites and their reactive intermediates. Site-selective spectroscopy continues to play a key role, making it possible to focus on active sites that exist within a distribution of inactive spectator metal centers. The definition of the geometric and electronic structures of metallozeolites has advanced to the level of bioinorganic chemistry, enabling direct comparison of metallozeolite active sites to functionally analogous Fe and Cu sites in biology. We identify significant parallels and differences in the strategies used by each to achieve high reactivity, highlighting potentially interesting mechanisms to tune the performance of synthetic catalysts.","1145":"Whereas individual steps of protein-coding gene expression in eukaryotes can be studied in isolation in vitro, it has become clear that these steps are intimately connected within cells. Connections not only ensure quality control but also fine-tune the gene expression process, which must adapt to environmental changes while remaining robust. In this review, we systematically present proven and potential mechanisms by which sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors can alter gene expression beyond transcription initiation and regulate pre-mRNA splicing, and thereby mRNA isoform production, by (i) influencing transcription elongation rates, (ii) binding to pre-mRNA to recruit splicing factors, and\/or (iii) blocking the association of splicing factors with pre-mRNA. We propose various mechanistic models throughout the review, in some cases without explicit supportive evidence, in hopes of providing fertile ground for future studies.","1146":null,"1147":"This review is aimed to provide a concise yet extensive survey of key short bioactive peptide sequences for a range of applications ranging from biomaterials development to peptides with therapeutic uses. The following are considered: cell adhesion motifs, structural peptides, cell-penetrating and tumor-homing peptides, antimicrobial peptides, peptide hormones, growth factors and matrix metalloprotease substrates, neuropeptides, amyloid peptides, antioxidant peptides, peptide affinity tags, anticancer peptides, and others. This review provides a convenient resource, summarizing a broad range of important sequences with great utility as a resource concerning both small peptide drugs and also novel biofunctional peptide-based materials.","1148":"CO2 conversion covers a wide range of possible application areas from fuels to bulk and commodity chemicals and even to specialty products with biological activity such as pharmaceuticals. In the present review, we discuss selected examples in these areas in a combined analysis of the state-of-the-art of synthetic methodologies and processes with their life cycle assessment. Thereby, we attempted to assess the potential to reduce the environmental footprint in these application fields relative to the current petrochemical value chain. This analysis and discussion differs significantly from a viewpoint on CO2 utilization as a measure for global CO2 mitigation. Whereas the latter focuses on reducing the end-of-pipe problem \"CO2 emissions\" from todays' industries, the approach taken here tries to identify opportunities by exploiting a novel feedstock that avoids the utilization of fossil resource in transition toward more sustainable future production. Thus, the motivation to develop CO2-based chemistry does not depend primarily on the absolute amount of CO2 emissions that can be remediated by a single technology. Rather, CO2-based chemistry is stimulated by the significance of the relative improvement in carbon balance and other critical factors defining the environmental impact of chemical production in all relevant sectors in accord with the principles of green chemistry.","1149":"Explosive growth in the use of open shell reactivity, including neutral radicals and radical ions, in the field of synthetic organic chemistry has been observed in the past decade, particularly since the advent of ruthenium complexes in 2008. These complexes generally induce single-electron transfer (SET) processes via visible-light absorption. Additionally, recent significant advancements in organic electrochemistry involving SET processes to provide open shell reactivity offer a complementary method to traditional polarity-driven reactions described by two-electron transfer processes. In this Review, we highlight the importance of intramolecular SET processes in the field of synthetic organic chemistry, which seem to be more elusive than the intermolecular versions, since they are net redox-neutral and thus cannot simply be regarded as oxidations or reductions. Such intramolecular SET processes can rationally be understood in combination with concomitant bond formations and\/or cleavages, and are regulated by a structural motif that we call a \"redox tag.\" In order to describe modern radical-driven reactions involving SET processes, we focus on a classical formalism in which electrons are treated as particles rather than waves, which offers a practical yet powerful approach to explain and\/or predict synthetic outcomes.","1150":"Traditional organic synthesis relies heavily on organic solvents for a multitude of tasks, including dissolving the components and facilitating chemical reactions, because many reagents and reactive species are incompatible or immiscible with water. Given that they are used in vast quantities as compared to reactants, solvents have been the focus of environmental concerns. Along with reducing the environmental impact of organic synthesis, the use of water as a reaction medium also benefits chemical processes by simplifying operations, allowing mild reaction conditions, and sometimes delivering unforeseen reactivities and selectivities. After the \"watershed\" in organic synthesis revealed the importance of water, the development of water-compatible catalysts has flourished, triggering a quantum leap in water-centered organic synthesis. Given that organic compounds are typically practically insoluble in water, simple extractive workup can readily separate a water-soluble homogeneous catalyst as an aqueous solution from a product that is soluble in organic solvents. In contrast, the use of heterogeneous catalysts facilitates catalyst recycling by allowing simple centrifugation and filtration methods to be used. This Review addresses advances over the past decade in catalytic reactions using water as a reaction medium.","1151":"Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has demonstrated unprecedented power in the characterization of surface plasmons. The subangstrom spatial resolution achieved in EELS and its capability of exciting the full set of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes supported by a metallic nanostructure makes STEM\/EELS an ideal tool in the study of LSPRs. The plasmonic properties characterized using EELS can be associated with geometric or structural features collected simultaneously in a STEM to achieve a deeper understanding of the plasmonic response. In this review, we provide the reader a thorough experimental description of EELS as a LSPR characterization tool and summarize the exciting recent progress in the field of STEM\/EELS plasmon characterization.","1152":"","1153":"In this review article, we consider the use of molecular oxygen in reactions mediated by polyoxometalates. Polyoxometalates are anionic metal oxide clusters of a variety of structures that are soluble in liquid phases and therefore amenable to homogeneous catalytic transformations. Often, they are active for electron transfer oxidations of a myriad of substrates and upon reduction can be reoxidized by molecular oxygen. For example, the phosphovanadomolybdate, H5PV2Mo10O40, can oxidize Pd(0) thereby enabling aerobic reactions catalyzed by Pd and H5PV2Mo10O40. In a similar vein, polyoxometalates can stabilize metal nanoparticles, leading to additional transformations. Furthermore, electron transfer oxidation of other substrates such as halides and sulfur-containing compounds is possible. More uniquely, H5PV2Mo10O40 and its analogues can mediate electron transfer-oxygen transfer reactions where oxygen atoms are transferred from the polyoxometalate to the substrate. This unique property has enabled correspondingly unique transformations involving carbon-carbon, carbon-hydrogen, and carbon-metal bond activation. The pathway for the reoxidation of vanadomolybdates with O2 appears to be an inner-sphere reaction, but the oxidation of one-electron reduced polyoxotungstates has been shown through intensive research to be an outer-sphere reaction. Beyond electron transfer and electron transfer-oxygen transfer aerobic transformations, there a few examples of apparent dioxygenase activity where both oxygen atoms are donated to a substrate.","1154":"Visible-light-driven photochemistry has continued to attract heightened interest due to its capacity to efficiently harvest solar energy and its potential to solve the global energy crisis. Plasmonic nanostructures boast broadly tunable optical properties coupled with catalytically active surfaces that offer a unique opportunity for solar photochemistry. Resonant optical excitation of surface plasmons produces energetic hot electrons that can be collected to facilitate chemical reactions. This review sums up recent theoretical and experimental approaches for understanding the underlying photophysical processes in hot electron generation and discusses various electron-transfer models on both plasmonic metal nanostructures and plasmonic metal\/semiconductor heterostructures. Following that are highlights of recent examples of plasmon-driven hot electron photochemical reactions within the context of both cases. The review concludes with a discussion about the remaining challenges in the field and future opportunities for addressing the low reaction efficiencies in hot-electron-induced photochemistry.","1155":"The [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic sulfoxides to allylic sulfenates is a reversible process, generally shifted toward the sulfoxide. In the presence of thiophiles, the sulfenate is trapped, and allylic alcohols are obtained under mild conditions. In most cases, a good transfer of stereochemical information through an ordered transition state is obtained. Furthermore, the ease of coupling this process with other versatile, stereocontrolled reactions has enhanced the usefulness of this protocol. This review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of this rearrangement and its application in the synthesis of natural and bioactive products.","1156":"Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein functions and interactions. ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, in which ADP-ribosyltransferases use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to modify target proteins with ADP-ribose. This modification can occur as mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation. The latter involves the synthesis of long ADP-ribose chains that have specific properties due to the nature of the polymer. ADP-Ribosylation is reversed by hydrolases that cleave the glycosidic bonds either between ADP-ribose units or between the protein proximal ADP-ribose and a given amino acid side chain. Here we discuss the properties of the different enzymes associated with ADP-ribosylation and the consequences of this PTM on substrates. Furthermore, the different domains that interpret either mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation and the implications for cellular processes are described.","1157":"Propargylamines are a versatile class of compounds which find broad application in many fields of chemistry. This review aims to describe the different strategies developed so far for the synthesis of propargylamines and their derivatives as well as to highlight their reactivity and use as building blocks in the synthesis of chemically relevant organic compounds. In the first part of the review, the different synthetic approaches to synthesize propargylamines, such as A3 couplings and C-H functionalization of alkynes, have been described and organized on the basis of the catalysts employed in the syntheses. Both racemic and enantioselective approaches have been reported. In the second part, an overview of the transformations of propargylamines into heterocyclic compounds such as pyrroles, pyridines, thiazoles, and oxazoles, as well as other relevant organic derivatives, is presented.","1158":"Interactions of macromolecules with growing crystalline surfaces play an important role in biomineralization, determine survival of some organisms at low temperatures, and offer a range of potential industrial applications. The current understanding of crystal growth processes in the presence of macromolecules, including peptides and proteins, is reviewed, with a focus on interactions between macromolecules and surfaces of crystalline materials, macromolecule adsorption on different types of crystal surfaces, crystallization kinetics in the presence of macromolecular additives, macromolecule incorporation, and defect generation. Throughout, special attention is paid to the selectivity of macromolecule adsorption on, and incorporation within, crystal surfaces. The special role played by the size and complexity of macromolecules as compared to other crystallization additives is emphasized.","1159":null,"1160":"The replacement of fossil resources that currently provide more than 90% of our energy needs and feedstocks of the chemical industry in combination with reduced emission of carbon dioxide is one of the most pressing challenges of mankind. Biomass as a globally available resource has been proposed as an alternative feedstock for production of basic building blocks, which could partially or even fully replace the currently utilized fossil-based ones in well-established chemical processes. The destruction of lignocellulosic feed followed by oxygen removal from its cellulose and hemicellulose content by catalytic processes results in the formation of initial platform chemicals (IPCs). However, their sustainable production strongly depends on the availability of resources, their efficient or even industrially viable conversion processes, and replenishment time of feedstocks. Herein, we overview recent advances and developments in catalytic transformations of the carbohydrate content of lignocellulosic biomass to IPCs (i.e., ethanol, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, isoprene, succinic and levulinic acids, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural). The mechanistic aspects, development of new catalysts, different efficiency indicators (yield and selectivity), and conversion conditions of their production are presented and compared. The potential biochemical production routes utilizing recently engineered microorganisms are reviewed, as well. The sustainability metrics that could be applied to the chemical industry (individual set of sustainability indicators, composite indices methods, material and energy flow analysis-based metrics, and ethanol equivalents) are also overviewed as well as an outlook is provided to highlight challenges and opportunities associated with this huge research area.","1161":"Natural carbohydrate polymers such as starch, cellulose, and chitin provide renewable alternatives to fossil fuels as a source for fuels and materials. As such, there is considerable interest in their conversion for industrial purposes, which is evidenced by the established and emerging markets for products derived from these natural polymers. In many cases, this is achieved via industrial processes that use enzymes to break down carbohydrates to monomer sugars. One of the major challenges facing large-scale industrial applications utilizing natural carbohydrate polymers is rooted in the fact that naturally occurring forms of starch, cellulose, and chitin can have tightly packed organizations of polymer chains with low hydration levels, giving rise to crystalline structures that are highly recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation. The topic of this review is oxidative cleavage of carbohydrate polymers by lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases (LPMOs). LPMOs are copper-dependent enzymes (EC 1.14.99.53-56) that, with glycoside hydrolases, participate in the degradation of recalcitrant carbohydrate polymers. Their activity and structural underpinnings provide insights into biological mechanisms of polysaccharide degradation.","1162":"Super-resolved structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) is among the most rapidly growing fluorescence microscopy techniques that can surpass the optical diffraction limit. The strength of SR-SIM is that it can be readily applied to samples prepared for conventional fluorescence microscopy, requiring no sophisticated sample preparation protocols. As an extension of wide-field fluorescence microscopy, it is inherently capable of multicolor imaging and optical sectioning and, with sufficiently fast implementations, permits live cell imaging. Image reconstruction, however, currently relies on sophisticated computational procedures, susceptible to reconstruction artifacts, requiring trained users to recognize and avoid them. Here, we review the latest developments in SR-SIM research. Starting from a historical overview of the development of SR-SIM, we review how this method can be implemented in various experimental schemes, we provide an overview of the important parameters involved in successful image reconstruction, we summarize recent biological applications, and we provide a brief outlook of the directions in which we believe SR-SIM is headed in the future.","1163":"X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is an electronic absorption technique for which the initial state is a deeply buried core level. The photon energies corresponding to such transitions are governed primarily by the binding energies of the initial state. Because the binding energies of core electrons vary significantly among atomic species, this makes XAS an element-selective spectroscopy. Proper interpretation of XA spectra can provide detailed information on the local chemical and geometric environment of the target atom. The introduction of liquid microjet and flow cell technologies into XAS experiments has enabled the general study of liquid samples. Liquids studied to date include water, alcohols, and solutions with relevance to biology and energy technology. This Review summarizes the experimental techniques employed in XAS studies of liquid samples and computational methods used for interpretation of the resulting spectra and summarizes salient experiments and results obtained in the XAS investigations of liquids.","1164":"The activation of O2 on metal surfaces is a critical process for heterogeneous catalysis and materials oxidation. Fundamental studies of well-defined metal surfaces using a variety of techniques have given crucial insight into the mechanisms, energetics, and dynamics of O2 adsorption and dissociation. Here, trends in the activation of O2 on transition metal surfaces are discussed, and various O2 adsorption states are described in terms of both electronic structure and geometry. The mechanism and dynamics of O2 dissociation are also reviewed, including the importance of the spin transition. The reactivity of O2 and O toward reactant molecules is also briefly discussed in the context of catalysis. The reactivity of a surface toward O2 generally correlates with the adsorption strength of O, the tendency to oxidize, and the heat of formation of the oxide. Periodic trends can be rationalized in terms of attractive and repulsive interactions with the d-band, such that inert metals tend to feature a full d band that is low energy and has a large spatial overlap with adsorbate states. More open surfaces or undercoordinated defect sites can be much more reactive than close-packed surfaces. Reactions between O and other species tend to be more prevalent than reactions between O2 and other species, particularly on more reactive surfaces.","1165":"Signaling by H2S is proposed to occur via persulfidation, a posttranslational modification of cysteine residues (RSH) to persulfides (RSSH). Persulfidation provides a framework for understanding the physiological and pharmacological effects of H2S. Due to the inherent instability of persulfides, their chemistry is understudied. In this review, we discuss the biologically relevant chemistry of H2S and the enzymatic routes for its production and oxidation. We cover the chemical biology of persulfides and the chemical probes for detecting them. We conclude by discussing the roles ascribed to protein persulfidation in cell signaling pathways.","1166":"Heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts are widely studied for the aerobic oxidations of C1-C4 alkanes to form olefins and oxygenates. In this review, we outline the properties of supported metal oxides, mixed-metal oxides, and zeolites and detail their most common applications as catalysts for partial oxidations of light alkanes. By doing this we establish similarities between different classes of metal oxides and identify common themes in reaction mechanisms and research strategies for catalyst improvement. For example, almost all partial alkane oxidations, regardless of the metal oxide, follow Mars-van Krevelen reaction kinetics, which utilize lattice oxygen atoms to reoxidize the reduced metal centers while the gaseous O2 reactant replenishes these lattice oxygen vacancies. Many of the most-promising metal oxide catalysts include V5+ surface species as a necessary constituent to convert the alkane. Transformations involving sequential oxidation steps (i.e., propane to acrylic acid) require specific reaction sites for each oxidation step and benefit from site isolation provided by spectator species. These themes, and others, are discussed in the text.","1167":null,"1168":"Ultrafast processes in light-absorbing proteins have been implicated in the primary step in the light-to-energy conversion and the initialization of photoresponsive biological functions. Theory and computations have played an instrumental role in understanding the molecular mechanism of such processes, as they provide a molecular-level insight of structural and electronic changes at ultrafast time scales that often are very difficult or impossible to obtain from experiments alone. Among theoretical strategies, the application of hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM\/MM) models is an important approach that has reached an evident degree of maturity, resulting in several important contributions to the field. This review presents an overview of state-of-the-art computational studies on subnanosecond events in rhodopsins, photoactive yellow proteins, phytochromes, and some other photoresponsive proteins where photoinduced double-bond isomerization occurs. The review also discusses current limitations that need to be solved in future developments.","1169":"Electrochemistry serves as a powerful method for generating reactive intermediates, such as organic cations. In general, there are two ways to use reactive intermediates for chemical reactions: (1) generation in the presence of a reaction partner and (2) generation in the absence of a reaction partner with accumulation in solution as a \"pool\" followed by reaction with a subsequently added reaction partner. The former approach is more popular because reactive intermediates are usually short-lived transient species, but the latter method is more flexible and versatile. This review focuses on the latter approach and provides a concise overview of the current methods for the generation and accumulation of cationic reactive intermediates as a pool using modern techniques of electrochemistry and their reactions with subsequently added nucleophilic reaction partners.","1170":"Silica-based materials (SBMs) are widely used in catalysis, photonics, and drug delivery. Their pores and cavities act as hosts of diverse guests ranging from classical dyes to drugs and quantum dots, allowing changes in the photochemical behavior of the confined guests. The heterogeneity of the guest populations as well as the confinement provided by these hosts affect the behavior of the formed hybrid materials. As a consequence, the observed reaction dynamics becomes significantly different and complex. Studying their photobehavior requires advanced laser-based spectroscopy and microscopy techniques as well as computational methods. Thanks to the development of ultrafast (spectroscopy and imaging) tools, we are witnessing an increasing interest of the scientific community to explore the intimate photobehavior of these composites. Here, we review the recent theoretical and ultrafast experimental studies of their photodynamics and discuss the results in comparison to those in homogeneous media. The discussion of the confined dynamics includes solvation and intra- and intermolecular proton-, electron-, and energy transfer events of the guest within the SBMs. Several examples of applications in photocatalysis, (photo)sensors, photonics, photovoltaics, and drug delivery demonstrate the vast potential of the SBMs in modern science and technology.","1171":"","1172":null,"1173":"The replacement of current petroleum-based plastics with sustainable alternatives is a crucial but formidable challenge for the modern society. Catalysis presents an enabling tool to facilitate the development of sustainable polymers. This review provides a system-level analysis of sustainable polymers and outlines key criteria with respect to the feedstocks the polymers are derived from, the manner in which the polymers are generated, and the end-of-use options. Specifically, we define sustainable polymers as a class of materials that are derived from renewable feedstocks and exhibit closed-loop life cycles. Among potential candidates, aliphatic polyesters and polycarbonates are promising materials due to their renewable resources and excellent biodegradability. The development of renewable monomers, the versatile synthetic routes to convert these monomers to polyesters and polycarbonate, and the different end-of-use options for these polymers are critically reviewed, with a focus on recent advances in catalytic transformations that lower the technological barriers for developing more sustainable replacements for petroleum-based plastics.","1174":"The complexity, diversity, and heterogeneity of tumors seriously undermine the therapeutic potential of treatment. Therefore, the current trend in clinical research has gradually shifted from a focus on monotherapy to combination therapy for enhanced treatment efficacy. More importantly, the cooperative enhancement interactions between several types of monotherapy contribute to the naissance of multimodal synergistic therapy, which results in remarkable superadditive (namely \"1 + 1 &gt; 2\") effects, stronger than any single therapy or their theoretical combination. In this review, state-of-the-art studies concerning recent advances in nanotechnology-mediated multimodal synergistic therapy will be systematically discussed, with an emphasis on the construction of multifunctional nanomaterials for realizing bimodal and trimodal synergistic therapy as well as the intensive exploration of the underlying synergistic mechanisms for explaining the significant improvements in synergistic therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, the featured applications of multimodal synergistic therapy in overcoming tumor multidrug resistance, hypoxia, and metastasis will also be discussed in detail, which may provide new ways for the efficient regression and even elimination of drug resistant, hypoxic solid, or distant metastatic tumors. Finally, some design tips for multifunctional nanomaterials and an outlook on the future development of multimodal synergistic therapy will be provided, highlighting key scientific issues and technical challenges and requiring remediation to accelerate clinical translation.","1175":"Readily available cyclodextrins (CDs) with an inherent hydrophobic internal cavity and hydrophilic external surface are macrocyclic entities that display a combination of molecular recognition and complexation properties with vital implications for host-guest supramolecular chemistry. While the host-guest chemistry of CDs has been widely recognized and led to their exploitation in a variety of important functions over the last five decades, these naturally occurring macrocyclic systems have emerged only recently as promising macrocyclic molecules to fabricate environmentally benign functional nanomaterials. This review surveys the development in the field paying special attention to the synthesis and emerging uses of various unmodified CD-metal complexes and CD-inorganic nanoparticle systems and identifies possible future directions. The association of a hydrophobic cavity of CDs with metal ions or various inorganic nanoparticles is a very appealing strategy for controlling the inorganic subunits properties in the very competitive water environment. In this review we provide the most prominent examples of unmodified CDs' inclusion complexes with organometallic guests and update the research in this field from the past decade. We discuss also the coordination flexibility of native CDs to metal ions in CD-based metal complexes and summarize the progress in the synthesis and characterization of CD-metal complexes and their use in catalysis and sensing as well as construction of molecular magnets. Then we provide a comprehensive overview of emerging applications of native CDs in materials science and nanotechnology. Remarkably, in the past few years CDs have appeared as attractive building units for the synthesis of carbohydrate metal-organic frameworks (CD-MOFs) in a combination of alkali-metal cations. The preparation of this new class of highly porous materials and their applications in the separation of small molecules, the loading of drug molecules, as well as efficient host templates in the construction of nanomaterials with the desired functionality, including the first-in-class devices including sensors and memristors, are highlighted. Finally, CDs as well-known \"green\" molecular hosts have also been used as ideal functional molecules to improve the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of inorganic nanoparticles. In this regard, we demonstrate various strategies for the preparation of native CDs-modified inorganic nanomaterials such as metal, metal oxide, and semiconductor and magnetic nanoparticles, aiming to take advantage of both the controlled properties of the inorganic core and the controlled properties of the coating molecules. The functionalization of a CD hydrophobic cavity with an inorganic nanoparticle is very prospective for the development of novel catalytic systems and new tools for highly selective and sensitive sensing platforms for various targets.","1176":null,"1177":"The preparation and transformation of heterocyclic structures have always been of great interest in organic chemistry.

Depending on the specific conditions, interactions, and cellular localization, different conformations may be stabilized, which differ in structure, redox properties, binding affinities, and enzymatic activity. The primary function is electron shuttling in oxidative phosphorylation, and is exerted by the so-called native cyt c in the intermembrane mitochondrial space of healthy cells. Under pro-apoptotic conditions, however, cyt c gains cardiolipin peroxidase activity, translocates into the cytosol to engage in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and enters the nucleus where it impedes nucleosome assembly. Other reported functions include cytosolic redox sensing and involvement in the mitochondrial oxidative folding machinery. Moreover, post-translational modifications such as nitration, phosphorylation, and sulfoxidation of specific amino acids induce alternative conformations with differential properties, at least in vitro. Similar structural and functional alterations are elicited by biologically significant electric fields and by naturally occurring mutations of human cyt c that, along with mutations at the level of the maturation system, are associated with specific diseases.

Because aberrant and excess ncRNAs are largely degraded by exoribonucleases, a key characteristic of these RNAs is an accessible, protein-free 5' or 3' end. Most exoribonucleases function with cofactors that recognize ncRNAs with accessible 5' or 3' ends and\/or increase the availability of these ends. Noncoding RNA surveillance pathways were first described in budding yeast, and there are now high-resolution structures of many components of the yeast pathways and significant mechanistic understanding as to how they function. Studies in human cells are revealing the ways in which these pathways both resemble and differ from their yeast counterparts, and are also uncovering numerous pathways that lack equivalents in budding yeast. In this review, we describe both the well-studied pathways uncovered in yeast and the new concepts that are emerging from studies in mammalian cells. We also discuss the ways in which surveillance pathways compete with chaperone proteins that transiently protect nascent ncRNA ends from exoribonucleases, with partner proteins that sequester these ends within RNPs, and with end modification pathways that protect the ends of some ncRNAs from nucleases.","1180":"This paper provides a systematic review and analysis of different phenomena that violate a basic principle, Kasha's rule, when applied to photochemical reactions. In contrast to the classical route of ultrafast transition to the lowest energy excited state and photochemical reaction starting therein, in some cases, these reactions proceed directly from high-energy excited states. Nowadays, this phenomenon can be observed for a number of major types of excited-state reactions: harvesting product via intersystem crossing; photoisomerizations; bond-breaking; and electron, proton, and energy transfers. We show that specific conditions for their observation are determined by kinetic factors. They should be among the fastest reactions in studied systems, competing with vibrational relaxation and radiative or nonradiative processes occurring in upper excited states. The anti-Kasha effects, which provide an important element that sheds light on the mechanisms of excited-state transformations, open new possibilities of selective control of these reactions for a variety of practical applications. Efficient utilization of excess electronic energy should enhance performance in the systems of artificial photosynthesis and photovoltaic devices. The modulation of the reporting signal by the energy of excitation of light should lead to new technologies in optical sensing and imaging.","1181":"The cell microenvironment has emerged as a key determinant of cell behavior and function in development, physiology, and pathophysiology. The extracellular matrix (ECM) within the cell microenvironment serves not only as a structural foundation for cells but also as a source of three-dimensional (3D) biochemical and biophysical cues that trigger and regulate cell behaviors. Increasing evidence suggests that the 3D character of the microenvironment is required for development of many critical cell responses observed in vivo, fueling a surge in the development of functional and biomimetic materials for engineering the 3D cell microenvironment. Progress in the design of such materials has improved control of cell behaviors in 3D and advanced the fields of tissue regeneration, in vitro tissue models, large-scale cell differentiation, immunotherapy, and gene therapy. However, the field is still in its infancy, and discoveries about the nature of cell-microenvironment interactions continue to overturn much early progress in the field. Key challenges continue to be dissecting the roles of chemistry, structure, mechanics, and electrophysiology in the cell microenvironment, and understanding and harnessing the roles of periodicity and drift in these factors. This review encapsulates where recent advances appear to leave the ever-shifting state of the art, and it highlights areas in which substantial potential and uncertainty remain.","1182":"Electrochemistry represents one of the most intimate ways of interacting with molecules.

These reactions share several key metalloporphyrin intermediates, typically derived from dioxygen and its congeners such as hydrogen peroxide. These species are composed of metal-dioxygen, metal-superoxo, metal-peroxo, and metal-oxo adducts. A wide variety of synthetic metalloporphyrinoid complexes have been synthesized to generate and stabilize these intermediates. These complexes have been studied to determine the spectroscopic features, structures, and reactivities of such species in controlled and well-defined environments. In this Review, we summarize recent findings on the reactivity of these species with common porphyrinoid scaffolds employed for biomimetic studies. The proposed mechanisms of action are emphasized. This Review is organized by structural type of metal-oxygen intermediate and broken into subsections based on the metal (manganese and iron) and porphyrinoid ligand (porphyrin, corrole, and corrolazine).","1184":"Exciting advancements have been made in the field of flexible electronic devices in the last two decades and will certainly lead to a revolution in peoples' lives in the future. However, because of the poor sustainability of the active materials in complex stress environments, new requirements have been adopted for the construction of flexible devices. Thus, hierarchical architectures in natural materials, which have developed various environment-adapted structures and materials through natural selection, can serve as guides to solve the limitations of materials and engineering techniques. This review covers the smart designs of structural materials inspired by natural materials and their utility in the construction of flexible devices. First, we summarize structural materials that accommodate mechanical deformations, which is the fundamental requirement for flexible devices to work properly in complex environments. Second, we discuss the functionalities of flexible devices induced by nature-inspired structural materials, including mechanical sensing, energy harvesting, physically interacting, and so on. Finally, we provide a perspective on newly developed structural materials and their potential applications in future flexible devices, as well as frontier strategies for biomimetic functions. These analyses and summaries are valuable for a systematic understanding of structural materials in electronic devices and will serve as inspirations for smart designs in flexible electronics.","1185":"This review classifies and summarizes the past 10-15 years of advancements in the field of metal-involving (i.e., metal-mediated and metal-catalyzed) reactions of oximes. These reactions are diverse in nature and have been employed for syntheses of oxime-based metal complexes and cage-compounds, oxime functionalizations, and the preparation of new classes of organic species, in particular, a wide variety of heterocyclic systems spanning small 3-membered ring systems to macroheterocycles.

One of the main disadvantages of hydrogen gas arises from its low density, and therefore, efficient handling and storage methods are key factors that need to be addressed to realize a hydrogen-based economy. Storage systems based on liquids, in particular, formic acid and alcohols, are highly attractive hydrogen carriers as they can be made from CO2 or other renewable materials, they can be used in stationary power storage units such as hydrogen filling stations, and they can be used directly as transportation fuels. However, to bring about a paradigm change in our energy infrastructure, efficient catalytic processes that release the hydrogen from these molecules, as well as catalysts that regenerate these molecules from CO2 and hydrogen, are required. In this review, we describe the considerable progress that has been made in homogeneous catalysis for these critical reactions, namely, the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid and methanol and the reverse dehydrogenation reactions. The dehydrogenation of higher alcohols available from renewable feedstocks is also described. Key structural features of the catalysts are analyzed, as is the role of additives, which are required in many systems. Particular attention is paid to advances in sustainable catalytic processes, especially to additive-free processes and catalysts based on Earth-abundant metal ions. Mechanistic information is also presented, and it is hoped that this review not only provides an account of the state of the art in the field but also offers insights into how superior catalytic systems can be obtained in the future.","1187":"Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) has been widely used to study the emissions, distributions, and chemical evolution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. The applications of PTR-MS have greatly promoted understanding of VOC sources and their roles in air-quality issues. In the past two decades, many new mass spectrometric techniques have been applied in PTR-MS instruments, and the performance of PTR-MS has improved significantly. This Review summarizes these developments and recent applications of PTR-MS in the atmospheric sciences. We discuss the latest instrument development and characterization work on PTR-MS instruments, including the use of time-of-flight mass analyzers and new types of ion guiding interfaces. Here we review what has been learned about the specificity of different product ion signals for important atmospheric VOCs. We present some of the recent highlights of VOC research using PTR-MS including new observations in urban air, biomass-burning plumes, forested regions, oil and natural gas production regions, agricultural facilities, the marine environment, laboratory studies, and indoor air. Finally, we will summarize some further instrument developments that are aimed at improving the sensitivity and specificity of PTR-MS and extending its use to other applications in atmospheric sciences, e.g., aerosol measurements and OH reactivity measurements.","1188":"Palladium-catalyzed aerobic oxidation reactions have been the focus of industrial application and extensive research efforts for nearly 60 years. A significant transition occurred in this field approximately 20 years ago, with the introduction of catalysts supported by ancillary ligands. The ligands play crucial roles in the reactions, including promotion of direct oxidation of palladium(0) by O2, bypassing the typical requirement for Cu salts or related redox cocatalysts to facilitate oxidation of the reduced Pd catalyst; facilitation of key bond-breaking and bond-forming steps during substrate oxidation; and modulation of chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity of a reaction. The use of ligands has contributed to significant expansion of the scope of accessible aerobic oxidation reactions. Increased understanding of the role of ancillary ligands should promote the development of new synthetic transformations, enable improved control over the reaction selectivity, and improve catalyst activity and stability. This review surveys the different ligands that have been used to support palladium-catalyzed aerobic oxidation reactions and, where possible, describes mechanistic insights into the role played by the ancillary ligand.","1189":"Rechargeable battery technologies have ignited major breakthroughs in contemporary society, including but not limited to revolutions in transportation, electronics, and grid energy storage. The remarkable development of rechargeable batteries is largely attributed to in-depth efforts to improve battery electrode and electrolyte materials. There are, however, still intimidating challenges of lower cost, longer cycle and calendar life, higher energy density, and better safety for large scale energy storage and vehicular applications. Further progress with rechargeable batteries may require new chemistries (lithium ion batteries and beyond) and better understanding of materials electrochemistry in the various battery technologies. In the past decade, advancement of battery materials has been complemented by new analytical techniques that are capable of probing battery chemistries at various length and time scales. Synchrotron X-ray techniques stand out as one of the most effective methods that allow for nearly nondestructive probing of materials characteristics such as electronic and geometric structures with various depth sensitivities through spectroscopy, scattering, and imaging capabilities. This article begins with the discussion of various rechargeable batteries and associated important scientific questions in the field, followed by a review of synchrotron X-ray based analytical tools (scattering, spectroscopy, and imaging) and their successful applications (ex situ, in situ, and in operando) in gaining fundamental insights into these scientific questions. Furthermore, electron microscopy and spectroscopy complement the detection length scales of synchrotron X-ray tools and are also discussed toward the end. We highlight the importance of studying battery materials by combining analytical techniques with complementary length sensitivities, such as the combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy with spatial resolution, because a sole technique may lead to biased and inaccurate conclusions. We then discuss the current progress of experimental design for synchrotron experiments and methods to mitigate beam effects. Finally, a perspective is provided to elaborate how synchrotron techniques can impact the development of next-generation battery chemistries.","1190":"Active plasmonics is a burgeoning and challenging subfield of plasmonics. It exploits the active control of surface plasmon resonance. In this review, a first-ever in-depth description of the theoretical relationship between surface plasmon resonance and its affecting factors, which forms the basis for active plasmon control, will be presented. Three categories of active plasmonic structures, consisting of plasmonic structures in tunable dielectric surroundings, plasmonic structures with tunable gap distances, and self-tunable plasmonic structures, will be proposed in terms of the modulation mechanism. The recent advances and current challenges for these three categories of active plasmonic structures will be discussed in detail. The flourishing development of active plasmonic structures opens access to new application fields. A significant part of this review will be devoted to the applications of active plasmonic structures in plasmonic sensing, tunable surface-enhanced Raman scattering, active plasmonic components, and electrochromic smart windows. This review will be concluded with a section on the future challenges and prospects for active plasmonics.","1191":"Species of Nicotiana grow naturally in different parts of the world and have long been used both medicinally and recreationally by human societies. More recently in our history, Nicotiana tabacum has attracted interest as one of the most economically important industrial crops. Nicotiana species are frequently investigated for their bioactive natural products, and the ecological role of their specialized metabolites in responses to abiotic stress or biotic stress factors like pathogens and herbivores. The interest of tobacco companies in genetic information as well as the success of a few wild tobacco species as experimental model organisms have resulted in growing knowledge about the molecular biology and ecology of these plants and functional studies of the plant's natural products. Although a large number of reviews and books on biologically active natural products already exists, mostly from N. tabacum, we focus our attention on the ecological roles and biological activity of natural products, versus products from cured and processed material, in this Review. The studied compounds include alkaloids, aromatic compounds, flavonoids, volatiles, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenes alcohols, and sugar esters from trichomes of the plants, and recently characterized acyclic hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs). In this Review (1800s-2017), we describe the above-mentioned classes of natural products, emphasizing their biological activities and functions as they have been determined either in bioassay-guided purification approaches or in bioassays with plants in which the expression of specific biosynthetic genes has been genetically manipulated. Additionally, a review on the history, taxonomy, ecology, and medicinal application of different Nicotiana species growing around the globe presented in this Review may be of interest for pharmacognosists, natural products, and ecological chemists.","1192":"Natural products have served as powerful therapeutics against pathogenic bacteria since the golden age of antibiotics of the mid-20th century. However, the increasing frequency of antibiotic-resistant infections clearly demonstrates that new antibiotics are critical for modern medicine. Because combinatorial approaches have not yielded effective drugs, we propose that the development of new antibiotics around proven natural scaffolds is the best short-term solution to the rising crisis of antibiotic resistance. We analyze herein synthetic approaches aiming to reengineer natural products into potent antibiotics. Furthermore, we discuss approaches in modulating quorum sensing and biofilm formation as a nonlethal method, as well as narrow-spectrum pathogen-specific antibiotics, which are of interest given new insights into the implications of disrupting the microbiome.","1193":null,"1194":"The alkyl group is the most common component of organic molecules and the most difficult to selectively functionalize. The development of catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkyl groups to give the corresponding olefins could open almost unlimited avenues to functionalization. Homogeneous systems, or more generally systems based on molecular (including solid-supported) catalysts, probably offer the greatest potential for regio- and chemoselective dehydrogenation of alkyl groups and alkanes. The greatest progress to date in this area has been achieved with pincer-ligated transition-metal-based catalysts; this and related chemistry are the subject of this review. Chemists are still far from achieving the most obvious and perhaps most attractive goal in this area, the dehydrogenation of simple alkanes to yield alkenes (specifically monoenes) with high yield and selectivity. Greater progress has been made with tandem catalysis and related approaches in which the initial dehydrogenated product undergoes a desirable secondary reaction. Also reviewed is the substantial progress that has been made in the closely related area of dehydrogenation of alkyl groups of substrates containing heteroatoms.","1195":"","1196":"How are water's material properties encoded within the structure of the water molecule? This is pertinent to understanding Earth's living systems, its materials, its geochemistry and geophysics, and a broad spectrum of its industrial chemistry. Water has distinctive liquid and solid properties: It is highly cohesive. It has volumetric anomalies-water's solid (ice) floats on its liquid; pressure can melt the solid rather than freezing the liquid; heating can shrink the liquid. It has more solid phases than other materials. Its supercooled liquid has divergent thermodynamic response functions. Its glassy state is neither fragile nor strong. Its component ions-hydroxide and protons-diffuse much faster than other ions. Aqueous solvation of ions or oils entails large entropies and heat capacities. We review how these properties are encoded within water's molecular structure and energies, as understood from theories, simulations, and experiments. Like simpler liquids, water molecules are nearly spherical and interact with each other through van der Waals forces. Unlike simpler liquids, water's orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding leads to open tetrahedral cage-like structuring that contributes to its remarkable volumetric and thermal properties.","1197":"Crossings of electronic potential energy surfaces in nuclear configuration space, known as conical intersections, determine the rates and outcomes of a large class of photochemical molecular processes. Much theoretical progress has been made in computing strongly coupled electronic and nuclear motions at different levels, but how to incorporate them in different spectroscopic signals and the approximations involved are less established. This will be the focus of the present review. We survey a wide range of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques which span from the infrared to the X-ray regimes and can be used for probing the nonadiabatic dynamics in the vicinity of conical intersections. Transient electronic and vibrational probes and their theoretical signal calculations are classified by their information content. This includes transient vibrational spectroscopic methods (transient infrared and femtosecond off-resonant stimulated Raman), resonant electronic probes (transient absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy), and novel stimulated X-ray Raman techniques. Along with the precise definition of what to calculate for predicting the various signals, we outline a toolbox of protocols for their simulation.","1198":"Through the use of the limited materials palette, optimally designed micro- and nanostructures, and tightly regulated processes, nature demonstrates exquisite control of light-matter interactions at various length scales. In fact, control of light-matter interactions is an important element in the evolutionary arms race and has led to highly engineered optical materials and systems. In this review, we present a detailed summary of various optical effects found in nature with a particular emphasis on the materials and optical design aspects responsible for their optical functionality. Using several representative examples, we discuss various optical phenomena, including absorption and transparency, diffraction, interference, reflection and antireflection, scattering, light harvesting, wave guiding and lensing, camouflage, and bioluminescence, that are responsible for the unique optical properties of materials and structures found in nature and biology. Great strides in understanding the design principles adapted by nature have led to a tremendous progress in realizing biomimetic and bioinspired optical materials and photonic devices. We discuss the various micro- and nanofabrication techniques that have been employed for realizing advanced biomimetic optical structures.","1199":"Catalytic four-electron reduction of O2 to water is one of the most extensively studied electrochemical reactions due to O2 exceptional availability and high O2\/H2O redox potential, which may in particular allow highly energetic reactions in fuel cells. To circumvent the use of expensive and inefficient Pt catalysts, multicopper oxidases (MCOs) have been envisioned because they provide efficient O2 reduction with almost no overpotential. MCOs have been used to elaborate enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs), a subclass of fuel cells in which enzymes replace the conventional catalysts. A glucose\/O2 EBFC, with a glucose oxidizing anode and a O2 reducing MCO cathode, could become the in vivo source of electricity that would power sometimes in the future integrated medical devices. This review covers the challenges and advances in the electrochemistry of MCOs and their use in EBFCs with a particular emphasis on the last 6 years. First basic features of MCOs and EBFCs are presented. Clues provided by electrochemistry to understand these enzymes and how they behave once connected at electrodes are described. Progresses realized in the development of efficient biocathodes for O2 reduction relying both on direct and mediated electron transfer mechanism are then discussed. Some implementations in EBFCs are finally presented.","1200":null,"1201":"Electrosynthesis has much to offer to the synthetic organic chemist. But in order to be widely accepted as a routine procedure in an organic synthesis laboratory, electrosynthesis needs to be presented in a much more user-friendly way. The literature is largely based on electrolysis in a glass beaker or H-cells that often give poor performance for synthesis with a very slow rate of conversion and, often, low selectivity and reproducibility. Flow cells can lead to much improved performance. Electrolysis is participating in the trend toward continuous flow synthesis, and this has led to a number of innovations in flow cell design that make possible selective syntheses with high conversion of reactant to product with a single passage of the reactant solution through the cell. In addition, the needs of the synthetic organic chemist can often be met by flow cells operating with recycle of the reactant solution. These cells give a high rate of product formation while the reactant concentration is high, but they perform best at low conversion. Both approaches are considered in this review and the important features of each cell design are discussed. Throughout, the application of the cell designs is illustrated with syntheses that have been reported.","1202":null,"1203":"Whereas numerous asymmetric methods for formation of quaternary carbon stereocenters in cyclic systems have been documented, the construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters with control of absolute stereochemistry remains a formidable challenge. This Review summarizes enantioselective methods for the construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters from achiral or chiral racemic reactants via transition metal catalysis.","1204":"Concepts of solid-state NMR spectroscopy and applications to fluid membranes are reviewed in this paper. Membrane lipids with 2H-labeled acyl chains or polar head groups are studied using 2H NMR to yield knowledge of their atomistic structures in relation to equilibrium properties. This review demonstrates the principles and applications of solid-state NMR by unifying dipolar and quadrupolar interactions and highlights the unique features offered by solid-state 2H NMR with experimental illustrations. For randomly oriented multilamellar lipids or aligned membranes, solid-state 2H NMR enables direct measurement of residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) due to individual C-2H-labeled segments. The distribution of RQC values gives nearly complete profiles of the segmental order parameters SCD(i) as a function of acyl segment position (i). Alternatively, one can measure residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for natural abundance lipid samples to obtain segmental SCH order parameters. A theoretical mean-torque model provides acyl-packing profiles representing the cumulative chain extension along the normal to the aqueous interface. Equilibrium structural properties of fluid bilayers and various thermodynamic quantities can then be calculated, which describe the interactions with cholesterol, detergents, peptides, and integral membrane proteins and formation of lipid rafts. One can also obtain direct information for membrane-bound peptides or proteins by measuring RDCs using magic-angle spinning (MAS) in combination with dipolar recoupling methods. Solid-state NMR methods have been extensively applied to characterize model membranes and membrane-bound peptides and proteins, giving unique information on their conformations, orientations, and interactions in the natural liquid-crystalline state.","1205":"The robust, sensitive, and selective detection of targeted biomolecules in their native environment by prospective nanostructures holds much promise for real-time, accurate, and high throughput biosensing. However, in order to be competitive, current biosensor nanotechnologies need significant improvements, especially in specificity, integration, throughput rate, and long-term stability in complex bioenvironments. Advancing biosensing nanotechnologies in chemically \"noisy\" bioenvironments require careful engineering of nanoscale components that are highly sensitive, biorecognition ligands that are capable of exquisite selective binding, and seamless integration at a level current devices have yet to achieve. This review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis, assembly, and applications of nanoengineered reporting and transducing components critical for efficient biosensing. First, major classes of nanostructured components, both inorganic reporters and organic transducers, are discussed in the context of the synthetic control of their individual compositions, shapes, and properties. Second, the design of surface functionalities and transducing path, the characterization of interfacial architectures, and the integration of multiple nanoscale components into multifunctional ordered nanostructures are extensively examined. Third, examples of current biosensing structures created from hybrid nanomaterials are reviewed, with a distinct emphasis on the need to tailor nanosensor designs to specific operating environments. Finally, we offer a perspective on the future developments of nanohybrid materials and future nanosensors, outline possible directions to be pursued that may yield breakthrough results, and envision the exciting potential of high-performance nanomaterials that will cause disruptive improvements in the field of biosensing.","1206":"Safety and efficacy constitute the major criteria governing regulatory approval of any new drug. The best method to maximize safety and efficacy is to deliver a proven therapeutic agent with a targeting ligand that exhibits little affinity for healthy cells but high affinity for pathologic cells. The probability of regulatory approval can conceivably be further enhanced by exploiting the same targeting ligand, conjugated to an imaging agent, to select patients whose diseased tissues display sufficient targeted receptors for therapeutic efficacy. The focus of this Review is to summarize criteria that must be met during design of ligand-targeted drugs (LTDs) to achieve the required therapeutic potency with minimal toxicity. Because most LTDs are composed of a targeting ligand (e.g., organic molecule, aptamer, protein scaffold, or antibody), spacer, cleavable linker, and therapeutic warhead, criteria for successful design of each component will be described. Moreover, because obstacles to successful drug design can differ among human pathologies, limitations to drug delivery imposed by the unique characteristics of different diseases will be considered. With the explosion of genomic and transcriptomic data providing an ever-expanding selection of disease-specific targets, and with tools for high-throughput chemistry offering an escalating diversity of warheads, opportunities for innovating safe and effective LTDs has never been greater.","1207":"The fundamental advantages and potential benefits of flow microreactor technology include extremely large surface-to-volume ratios, precise control over temperature and residence time, extremely fast molecular diffusion, and increased safety during reactive processes. These advantages and benefits can be applied to a wide range of electrosynthetic techniques, and so the integration of flow microreactors with electrosynthesis has received significant research interest from both academia and industry. This review presents an up-to-date overview of electrosynthetic processes in continuous-flow microreactors. In addition, the advantages of continuous-flow electrochemistry are discussed, along with a thorough comparison of microreactor-based processes and conventional batch reaction systems.","1208":"Based on the principles and metrics of green chemistry and sustainable development, biocatalysis is both a green and sustainable technology. This is largely a result of the spectacular advances in molecular biology and biotechnology achieved in the past two decades. Protein engineering has enabled the optimization of existing enzymes and the invention of entirely new biocatalytic reactions that were previously unknown in Nature. It is now eminently feasible to develop enzymatic transformations to fit predefined parameters, resulting in processes that are truly sustainable by design. This approach has successfully been applied, for example, in the industrial synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In addition to the use of protein engineering, other aspects of biocatalysis engineering, such as substrate, medium, and reactor engineering, can be utilized to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness and, hence, the sustainability of biocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, immobilization of an enzyme can improve its stability and enable its reuse multiple times, resulting in better performance and commercial viability. Consequently, biocatalysis is being widely applied in the production of pharmaceuticals and some commodity chemicals. Moreover, its broader application will be further stimulated in the future by the emerging biobased economy.","1209":null,"1210":"This review is a comprehensive description of the past decade of research into understanding how the geometry and size of nanoparticles affect their interaction with biological systems: from single cells to whole organisms. Recently, there has been a great deal of effort to use both the shape and the size of nanoparticles to target specific cellular uptake mechanisms, biodistribution patterns, and pharmacokinetics. While the successes of spherical lipid-based nanoparticles have heralded marked changes in chemotherapy worldwide, the history of asbestos-induced lung disease casts a long shadow over fibrous materials to date. The impact of particle morphology is known to be intertwined with many physicochemical parameters, namely, size, elasticity, surface chemistry, and biopersistence. In this review, we first highlight some of the morphologies observed in nature as well as shapes available to us through synthetic strategies. Following this we discuss attempts to understand the cellular uptake of nanoparticles through various theoretical models before comparing this with observations from in vitro and in vivo experiments. In addition, we consider the impact of nanoparticle shape at different size regimes on targeting, cytotoxicity, and cellular mechanics.","1211":"Fifty years have passed since the foundation of organometallic neptunium chemistry, and yet only a handful of complexes have been reported, and even fewer have been fully characterized. Yet, increasingly, combined synthetic\/spectroscopic\/computational studies are demonstrating how covalently bonding, soft, carbocyclic organometallic ligands provide an excellent platform for advancing the fundamental understanding of the differences in orbital contributions and covalency in f-block metal-ligand bonding. Understanding the subtleties is the key to the safe handling and separations of the highly radioactive nuclei. This review describes the complexes that have been synthesized to date and presents a critical assessment of the successes and difficulties in their analysis and the bonding information they have provided. Because of increasing recent efforts to start new Np-capable air-sensitive inorganic chemistry laboratories, the importance of radioactivity, the basics of Np decay and its ramifications (including the radiochemical synthesis of one organometallic compound), and the available anhydrous starting materials are also surveyed. The review also highlights a range of instances in which important differences in the chemical behavior between Np and its closest neighbors, uranium and plutonium, are found.","1212":"Peptide sequences are known to recognize and bind different nanomaterial surfaces, which has resulted in the screening and identification of hundreds of peptides with the ability to bind to a wide range of metallic, metal oxide, mineral, and polymer substrates. These biomolecules are able to bind to materials with relatively high affinity, resulting in the generation of a complex biointerface between the biotic and abiotic components. While the number of material-binding sequences is large, at present, quantitative materials-binding characterization of these peptides has been accomplished only for a relatively small number of sequences. Moreover, it is currently very challenging to determine the molecular-level structure(s) of these peptides in the materials adsorbed state. Despite this lack of data related to the structure and function of this remarkable biointerface, several of these peptide sequences have found extensive use in creating functional nanostructured materials for assembly, catalysis, energy, and medicine, all of which are dependent on the structure of the individual peptides and collective biointerface at the material surface. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of these applications and illustrate how the versatility of this peptide-mediated approach for the growth, organization, and activation of nanomaterials could be more widely expanded via the elucidation of biointerfacial structure\/property relationships. Future directions and grand challenges to realize these goals are highlighted for both experimental characterization and molecular-simulation strategies.","1213":"The year 2017 marks the twentieth anniversary of terpenoid cyclase structural biology: a trio of terpenoid cyclase structures reported together in 1997 were the first to set the foundation for understanding the enzymes largely responsible for the exquisite chemodiversity of more than 80000 terpenoid natural products. Terpenoid cyclases catalyze the most complex chemical reactions in biology, in that more than half of the substrate carbon atoms undergo changes in bonding and hybridization during a single enzyme-catalyzed cyclization reaction. The past two decades have witnessed structural, functional, and computational studies illuminating the modes of substrate activation that initiate the cyclization cascade, the management and manipulation of high-energy carbocation intermediates that propagate the cyclization cascade, and the chemical strategies that terminate the cyclization cascade. The role of the terpenoid cyclase as a template for catalysis is paramount to its function, and protein engineering can be used to reprogram the cyclization cascade to generate alternative and commercially important products. Here, I review key advances in terpenoid cyclase structural and chemical biology, focusing mainly on terpenoid cyclases and related prenyltransferases for which X-ray crystal structures have informed and advanced our understanding of enzyme structure and function.","1214":"","1215":"Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) has been advanced in recent years toward measuring signals from only a monolayer of sample molecules at solid-liquid and solid-gas interfaces. A series of experimental methods has been introduced, which in the chronological order of development are 2D sum-frequency-generation (2D SFG), transmission 2D IR, and reflection 2D IR, the latter in either internal, attenuated total reflection (ATR), or external reflection configuration. The different variants of 2D vibrational spectroscopy are based on either the even-order or the odd-order nonlinear susceptibility, and all allow resolving similar molecular temporal and spectral information. In this review, we introduce the basic principles of the different methods of 2D vibrational spectroscopy at surfaces along with a balanced overview on the technological aspects as well as benefits and shortcomings. We furthermore discuss the current scope of applications for 2D vibrational surface spectroscopy, which spans an impressively broad range of samples from biological molecules to heterogeneous catalysts. The emphasis is on the ultrafast structural dynamics of molecules at interfaces, environmental interactions, and intermolecular interactions. We furthermore consider important recent technological developments of 2D vibrational surface spectroscopy, which employ (i) surface enhancement, (ii) methods for studying electrochemical interfaces, and (iii) extensions for resolving nonequilibrium processes (transient 2D IR). A detailed outlook is finally given regarding important future applications and technological developments of 2D vibrational surface spectroscopy.","1216":"Posttranslational modifications are covalent changes made to proteins that typically alter the function or location of the protein. AMPylation is an emerging posttranslational modification that involves the addition of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to a protein. Like other, more well-studied posttranslational modifications, AMPylation is predicted to regulate the activity of the modified target proteins. However, the scope of this modification both in bacteria and in eukaryotes remains to be fully determined. In this review, we provide an up to date overview of the known AMPylating enzymes, the regulation of these enzymes, and the effect of this modification on target proteins.","1217":"This article reviews several classes of compliant materials that can be utilized to fabricate electronic muscles and skins. Different classes of materials range from compliant conductors, semiconductors, to dielectrics, all of which play a vital and cohesive role in the development of next generation electronics. This paper covers recent advances in the development of new materials, as well as the engineering of well-characterized materials for the repurposing in applications of flexible and stretchable electronics. In addition to compliant materials, this article further discusses the use of these materials for integrated systems to develop soft sensors and actuators. These new materials and new devices pave the way for a new generation of electronics that will change the way we see and interact with our devices for decades to come.","1218":"The discovery of simple and efficient catalyst systems for the asymmetric oxofunctionalization of hydrocarbons is a challenging task of catalytic chemistry. In this paper, we give an overview of catalyst systems capable of conducting asymmetric oxygenative transformations of organic molecules and, in line with the major trend to sustainability, relying on green oxidants H2O2 and O2 as the ultimate oxygen source. The full historical period of asymmetric oxidation catalysis (1970 to the present day) is covered; both transition-metal-based and organocatalytic systems are considered. The focus of this review is the catalytic properties of the existing catalyst systems, in particular stereoselectivity, activity, efficiency, and synthetic outlook. At the same time, mechanistic peculiarities of stereoselective oxygen transfer are given attention.","1219":"Electrons are the workhorses of solar energy conversion. Conversion of the energy of light to electricity in photovoltaics, or to energy-rich molecules (solar fuel) through photocatalytic processes, invariably starts with photoinduced generation of energy-rich electrons. The harvesting of these electrons in practical devices rests on a series of electron transfer processes whose dynamics and efficiencies determine the function of materials and devices. To capture the energy of a photogenerated electron-hole pair in a solar cell material, charges of opposite sign have to be separated against electrostatic attractions, prevented from recombining and being transported through the active material to electrodes where they can be extracted. In photocatalytic solar fuel production, these electron processes are coupled to chemical reactions leading to storage of the energy of light in chemical bonds. With the focus on the ultrafast time scale, we here discuss the light-induced electron processes underlying the function of several molecular and hybrid materials currently under development for solar energy applications in dye or quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, polymer-fullerene polymer solar cells, organometal halide perovskite solar cells, and finally some photocatalytic systems.","1220":"Plant cell walls are composed of an intricate network of polysaccharides and proteins that varies during the developmental stages of the cell. This makes it very challenging to address the functions of individual wall components in cells, especially for highly complex glycans. Fortunately, structurally defined oligosaccharides can be used as models for the glycans, to study processes such as cell wall biosynthesis, polysaccharide deposition, protein-carbohydrate interactions, and cell-cell adhesion. Synthetic chemists have focused on preparing such model compounds, as they can be produced in good quantities and with high purity. This Review contains an overview of those plant and algal polysaccharides that have been elucidated to date. The majority of the content is devoted to detailed summaries of the chemical syntheses of oligosaccharide fragments of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and arabinogalactans, as well as glycans unique to algae. Representative synthetic routes within each class are discussed in detail, and the progress in carbohydrate chemistry over recent decades is highlighted.","1221":"Control of protein levels by nucleic-acid-based technologies has proven to be a useful research tool but lacks the advantages of small molecules with respect to cell permeability, temporal control, and the potential generation of therapeutics.

However, the use of cell-based products derived from stem cells as therapeutics has limitations including rejection, sufficient availability, and lack of appropriate engraftment. Chemical control of stem cells provides potential solutions for overcoming many of the current limitations in cell-based therapeutics. The development of exogenous molecules to control stem cell self-renewal or differentiation has arrived at natural product-based agents as an important class of modulators. The ex vivo production of cryopreserved cellular products for use in tissue repair is a relatively new area of medicine in which the conventional hurdles to implementing chemicals to effect human health are changed. Translational challenges centered on chemistry, such as pharmacokinetics, are reduced. Importantly, in many cases the desired human tissues can be evaluated against new chemicals, and approaches to cellular regulation can be validated in the clinically applicable system. As a result linking new and existing laboratory syntheses of natural products with findings of the compounds' unique abilities to regulate stem cell fate provides opportunities for developing improved methods for tissue manufacture, accessing probe compounds, and generating new leads that yield manufactured cells with improved properties. This review provides a summary of natural products that have shown promise in controlling stem cell fate and which have also been fully synthesized thereby providing chemistry platforms for further development.","1224":"Nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the emerging field of nanotechnology. Their unique and tunable size-dependent properties (in the range 1-100 nm) make these materials indispensable in many modern technological applications. In this Review, we summarize the state-of-art in the manufacture and applications of inorganic nanoparticles made using continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) processes. First, we introduce ideal requirements of any flow process for nanoceramics production, outline different approaches to CHFS, and introduce the pertinent properties of supercritical water and issues around mixing in flow, to generate nanoparticles. This Review then gives comprehensive coverage of the current application space for CHFS-made nanomaterials including optical, healthcare, electronics (including sensors, information, and communication technologies), catalysis, devices (including energy harvesting\/conversion\/fuels), and energy storage applications. Thereafter, topics of precursor chemistry and products, as well as materials or structures, are discussed (surface-functionalized hybrids, nanocomposites, nanograined coatings and monoliths, and metal-organic frameworks). Later, this Review focuses on some of the key apparatus innovations in the field, such as in situ flow\/rapid heating systems (to investigate kinetics and mechanisms), approaches to high throughput flow syntheses (for nanomaterials discovery), as well as recent developments in scale-up of hydrothermal flow processes. Finally, this Review covers environmental considerations, future directions and capabilities, along with the conclusions and outlook.","1225":"Additive manufacturing (AM) alias 3D printing translates computer-aided design (CAD) virtual 3D models into physical objects. By digital slicing of CAD, 3D scan, or tomography data, AM builds objects layer by layer without the need for molds or machining. AM enables decentralized fabrication of customized objects on demand by exploiting digital information storage and retrieval via the Internet. The ongoing transition from rapid prototyping to rapid manufacturing prompts new challenges for mechanical engineers and materials scientists alike. Because polymers are by far the most utilized class of materials for AM, this Review focuses on polymer processing and the development of polymers and advanced polymer systems specifically for AM. AM techniques covered include vat photopolymerization (stereolithography), powder bed fusion (SLS), material and binder jetting (inkjet and aerosol 3D printing), sheet lamination (LOM), extrusion (FDM, 3D dispensing, 3D fiber deposition, and 3D plotting), and 3D bioprinting. The range of polymers used in AM encompasses thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, hydrogels, functional polymers, polymer blends, composites, and biological systems. Aspects of polymer design, additives, and processing parameters as they relate to enhancing build speed and improving accuracy, functionality, surface finish, stability, mechanical properties, and porosity are addressed. Selected applications demonstrate how polymer-based AM is being exploited in lightweight engineering, architecture, food processing, optics, energy technology, dentistry, drug delivery, and personalized medicine. Unparalleled by metals and ceramics, polymer-based AM plays a key role in the emerging AM of advanced multifunctional and multimaterial systems including living biological systems as well as life-like synthetic systems.","1226":"The lithium metal battery is strongly considered to be one of the most promising candidates for high-energy-density energy storage devices in our modern and technology-based society. However, uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth induces poor cycling efficiency and severe safety concerns, dragging lithium metal batteries out of practical applications. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the lithium metal anode and its dendritic lithium growth. First, the working principles and technical challenges of a lithium metal anode are underscored. Specific attention is paid to the mechanistic understandings and quantitative models for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, lithium dendrite nucleation, and growth. On the basis of previous theoretical understanding and analysis, recently proposed strategies to suppress dendrite growth of lithium metal anode and some other metal anodes are reviewed. A section dedicated to the potential of full-cell lithium metal batteries for practical applications is included. A general conclusion and a perspective on the current limitations and recommended future research directions of lithium metal batteries are presented. The review concludes with an attempt at summarizing the theoretical and experimental achievements in lithium metal anodes and endeavors to realize the practical applications of lithium metal batteries.","1227":"We review the progress achieved during the recent five years in immunochemical biosensors (immunosensors) combined with nanoparticles for enhanced sensitivity. The initial part introduces antibodies as classic recognition elements. The optical sensing part describes fluorescent, luminescent, and surface plasmon resonance systems. Amperometry, voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy represent electrochemical transducer methods; electrochemiluminescence with photoelectric conversion constitutes a widely utilized combined method. The transducing options function together with suitable nanoparticles: metallic and metal oxides, including magnetic ones, carbon-based nanotubes, graphene variants, luminescent carbon dots, nanocrystals as quantum dots, and photon up-converting particles. These sources merged together provide extreme variability of existing nanoimmunosensing options. Finally, applications in clinical analysis (markers, tumor cells, and pharmaceuticals) and in the detection of pathogenic microorganisms, toxic agents, and pesticides in the environmental field and food products are summarized.","1228":"Materials with switchable mechanical properties are widespread in living organisms and endow many species with traits that are essential for their survival. Many of the mechanically morphing materials systems found in nature are based on hierarchical structures, which are the basis for mechanical robustness and often also the key to responsive behavior. Many \"operating principles\" involve cascades of events that translate cues from the environment into changes of the overall structure and\/or the connectivity of the constituting building blocks at various levels. These concepts permit dramatic property variations without significant compositional changes. Inspired by the function and the growing understanding of the operating principles at play in biological materials with the capability to change their mechanical properties, significant efforts have been made toward mimicking such architectures and functions in artificial materials. Research in this domain has rapidly grown in the last two decades and afforded many examples of bioinspired materials that are able to reversibly alter their stiffness, shape, porosity, density, or hardness upon remote stimulation. This review summarizes the state of research in this field.","1229":"Ionic liquids (ILs) have now been acknowledged as reaction media for biotransformations. The first three examples were reported in this field in 2000, and since then, numerous applications have been reported for biocatalytic reactions using ILs. Two topics using ILs for enzymatic reactions have been reviewed from the standpoint of biocatalyst mediating organic synthesis; the first is \"Biocatalysis in Ionic Liquids\" which includes various types of biocatalytic reactions in ILs (section 2): (1) recent examples of lipase-mediated reactions using ILs as reaction media for biodiesel oil production and for sugar ester production, (2) oxidase-catalyzed reactions in ILs, (3) laccase-catalyzed reactions, (4) peroxidase-catalyzed reactions, (4) cytochrome-mediated reactions, (5) microbe-mediated hydrations, (6) protease-catalyzed reactions, (8) whole cell mediated asymmetric reduction of ketones, (10) acylase-catalyzed reactions, (11) glycosylation or cellulase-mediated hydrolysis of polysaccharides, (12) hydroxynitrile lyase-catalyzed reaction, (13) fluorinase or haloalkane dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction, (14) luciferase-catalyzed reactions, and (15) biocatalytic promiscuity of enzymatic reactions for organic synthesis using ILs. The second is \"Enzymes Activated by Ionic Liquids for Organic Synthesis\", particularly describing the finding story of activation of lipases by the coating with a PEG-substituted IL (section 3). The author's opinion toward \"Future Perspectives of Using ILs for Enzymatic Reactions\" has also been discussed in section 4.","1230":"Spinels with the formula of AB2O4 (where A and B are metal ions) and the properties of magnetism, optics, electricity, and catalysis have taken significant roles in applications of data storage, biotechnology, electronics, laser, sensor, conversion reaction, and energy storage\/conversion, which largely depend on their precise structures and compositions. In this review, various spinels with controlled preparations and their applications in oxygen reduction\/evolution reaction (ORR\/OER) and beyond are summarized. First, the composition and structure of spinels are introduced. Then, recent advances in the preparation of spinels with solid-, solution-, and vapor-phase methods are summarized, and new methods are particularly highlighted. The physicochemical characteristics of spinels such as their compositions, structures, morphologies, defects, and substrates have been rationally regulated through various approaches. This regulation can yield spinels with improved ORR\/OER catalytic activities, which can further accelerate the speed, prolong the life, and narrow the polarization of fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water splitting devices. Finally, the magnetic, optical, electrical, and catalytic applications beyond the OER\/ORR are also discussed. The future applications of spinels are considered to be closely related to environmental and energy issues, which will be aided by the development of new species with precise preparations and advanced characterizations.","1231":"","1232":"","1233":"Metallic nanoparticles such as silver and gold show localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs), which are associated with near-field enhancement effects in the vicinity of nanoparticles. Therefore, strong light-matter interaction is induced by the near-field enhancement effects of LSPRs. Because the resonant wavelength of LSPRs can be easily controlled by the size and shape of the metallic nanoparticles in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range, LSPRs have received considerable attention as optical antennae for light energy conversion systems such as solar cells. LSPRs decay very quickly as a result of light scattering and excitation of electron-hole pairs in the metal itself. However, in addition to the near-field enhancement effect, this light scattering and electron-hole pair excitation, which are known to cause loss of LSPRs, can be utilized as a solar cell enhancement mechanism. Here, we focus on plasmonic solid-state solar cells. The mechanisms of the light scattering by LSPRs, near-field enhancement, and plasmon-induced charge separation based on electron-hole pair excitations can be clarified. We review the related studies from the viewpoint of these mechanisms rather than material science.","1234":"Acireductone dioxygenase (ARD) from the methionine salvage pathway (MSP) is a unique enzyme that exhibits dual chemistry determined solely by the identity of the divalent transition-metal ion (Fe2+ or Ni2+) in the active site. The Fe2+-containing isozyme catalyzes the on-pathway reaction using substrates 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopent-1-ene (acireductone) and dioxygen to generate formate and the ketoacid precursor of methionine, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate, whereas the Ni2+-containing isozyme catalyzes an off-pathway shunt with the same substrates, generating methylthiopropionate, carbon monoxide, and formate. The dual chemistry of ARD was originally discovered in the bacterium Klebsiella oxytoca, but it has recently been shown that mammalian ARD enzymes (mouse and human) are also capable of catalyzing metal-dependent dual chemistry in vitro. This is particularly interesting, since carbon monoxide, one of the products of off-pathway reaction, has been identified as an antiapoptotic molecule in mammals. In addition, several biochemical and genetic studies have indicated an inhibitory role of human ARD in cancer. This comprehensive review describes the biochemical and structural characterization of the ARD family, the proposed experimental and theoretical approaches to establishing mechanisms for the dual chemistry, insights into the mechanism based on comparison with structurally and functionally similar enzymes, and the applications of this research to the field of artificial metalloenzymes and synthetic biology.","1235":"Novel affinity agents with high specificity are needed to make progress in disease diagnosis and therapy. Over the last several years, peptides have been considered to have fundamental benefits over other affinity agents, such as antibodies, due to their fast blood clearance, low immunogenicity, rapid tissue penetration, and reproducible chemical synthesis. These features make peptides ideal affinity agents for applications in disease diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide variety of afflictions. Virus-derived peptide techniques provide a rapid, robust, and high-throughput way to identify organism-targeting peptides with high affinity and selectivity. Here, we will review viral peptide display techniques, how these techniques have been utilized to select new organism-targeting peptides, and their numerous biomedical applications with an emphasis on targeted imaging, diagnosis, and therapeutic techniques. In the future, these virus-derived peptides may be used as common diagnosis and therapeutics tools in local clinics.","1236":"The incorporation of a synthetic, catalytically competent metallocofactor into a protein scaffold to generate an artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) has been explored since the late 1970's. Progress in the ensuing years was limited by the tools available for both organometallic synthesis and protein engineering. Advances in both of these areas, combined with increased appreciation of the potential benefits of combining attractive features of both homogeneous catalysis and enzymatic catalysis, led to a resurgence of interest in ArMs starting in the early 2000's. Perhaps the most intriguing of potential ArM properties is their ability to endow homogeneous catalysts with a genetic memory. Indeed, incorporating a homogeneous catalyst into a genetically encoded scaffold offers the opportunity to improve ArM performance by directed evolution. This capability could, in turn, lead to improvements in ArM efficiency similar to those obtained for natural enzymes, providing systems suitable for practical applications and greater insight into the role of second coordination sphere interactions in organometallic catalysis. Since its renaissance in the early 2000's, different aspects of artificial metalloenzymes have been extensively reviewed and highlighted. Our intent is to provide a comprehensive overview of all work in the field up to December 2016, organized according to reaction class. Because of the wide range of non-natural reactions catalyzed by ArMs, this was done using a functional-group transformation classification. The review begins with a summary of the proteins and the anchoring strategies used to date for the creation of ArMs, followed by a historical perspective. Then follows a summary of the reactions catalyzed by ArMs and a concluding critical outlook. This analysis allows for comparison of similar reactions catalyzed by ArMs constructed using different metallocofactor anchoring strategies, cofactors, protein scaffolds, and mutagenesis strategies. These data will be used to construct a searchable Web site on ArMs that will be updated regularly by the authors.","1237":"Cysteine thiols are among the most reactive functional groups in proteins, and their pairing in disulfide linkages is a common post-translational modification in proteins entering the secretory pathway. This modest amino acid alteration, the mere removal of a pair of hydrogen atoms from juxtaposed cysteine residues, contrasts with the substantial changes that characterize most other post-translational reactions. However, the wide variety of proteins that contain disulfides, the profound impact of cross-linking on the behavior of the protein polymer, the numerous and diverse players in intracellular pathways for disulfide formation, and the distinct biological settings in which disulfide bond formation can take place belie the simplicity of the process. Here we lay the groundwork for appreciating the mechanisms and consequences of disulfide bond formation in vivo by reviewing chemical principles underlying cysteine pairing and oxidation. We then show how enzymes tune redox-active cofactors and recruit oxidants to improve the specificity and efficiency of disulfide formation. Finally, we discuss disulfide bond formation in a cellular context and identify important principles that contribute to productive thiol oxidation in complex, crowded, dynamic environments.","1238":"This Review summarizes the advancements in Pd-catalyzed C(sp3)-H activation via various redox manifolds, including Pd(0)\/Pd(II), Pd(II)\/Pd(IV), and Pd(II)\/Pd(0). While few examples have been reported in the activation of alkane C-H bonds, many C(sp3)-H activation\/C-C and C-heteroatom bond forming reactions have been developed by the use of directing group strategies to control regioselectivity and build structural patterns for synthetic chemistry. A number of mono- and bidentate ligands have also proven to be effective for accelerating C(sp3)-H activation directed by weakly coordinating auxiliaries, which provides great opportunities to control reactivity and selectivity (including enantioselectivity) in Pd-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions.","1239":"","1240":"As two coexisting and fast-growing research fields in modern synthetic chemistry, the merging of organocatalysis and C-H bond functionalization is well foreseeable, and the joint force along this line has been demonstrated to be a powerful approach in making inert C-H bond functionalization more viable, predictable, and selective. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of organocatalysis in inert C-H bond functionalization over the past two decades. The review is arranged by types of inert C-H bonds including alkane C-H, arene C-H, and vinyl C-H as well as those activated benzylic C-H, allylic C-H, and C-H bonds alpha to the heteroatom such as nitrogen and oxygen. In each section, the discussion is classified by the explicit organocatalytic mode involved.","1241":"We review the tremendous advances in ultrafast X-ray science, over the past 15 years, making the best use of new ultrashort X-ray sources including table-top or large-scale facilities. Different complementary X-ray-based techniques, including spectroscopy, scattering, and diffraction, are presented. The broad and expanding spectrum of these techniques in the ultrafast time domain is delivering new insight into the dynamics of molecular systems, of solutions, of solids, and of biosystems. Probing the time evolution of the electronic and structural degrees of freedom of these systems on the time scales of femtosecond to picoseconds delivers new insight into our understanding of dynamical matter.","1242":"The inherent structure tunability, good affinity with CO2, and nonvolatility of ionic liquids (ILs) drive their exploration and exploitation in CO2 separation field, and has attracted remarkable interest from both industries and academia. The aim of this Review is to give a detailed overview on the recent advances on IL-based materials, including pure ILs, IL-based solvents, and IL-based membranes for CO2 capture and separation from the viewpoint of molecule to engineering.

Taking into consideration of the applications and industrialization, the recent achievements and developments on the transport properties of IL fluids and the process design of IL-based processes are highlighted. Finally, the future research challenges and perspectives of the commercialization of CO2 capture and separation with IL-based materials are posed.","1243":null,"1244":"Recently there have been many research breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene, boron nitride (h-BN), black phosphors (BPs), and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The unique electrical, optical, and thermal properties in 2D materials are associated with their strictly defined low dimensionalities. These materials provide a wide range of basic building blocks for next-generation electronics. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique has shown great promise to generate high-quality TMDC layers with scalable size, controllable thickness, and excellent electronic properties suitable for both technological applications and fundamental sciences. The capability to precisely engineer 2D materials by chemical approaches has also given rise to fascinating new physics, which could lead to exciting new applications. In this Review, we introduce the latest development of TMDC synthesis by CVD approaches and provide further insight for the controllable and reliable synthesis of atomically thin TMDCs. Understanding of the vapor-phase growth mechanism of 2D TMDCs could benefit the formation of complicated heterostructures and novel artificial 2D lattices.","1245":"Hydrogen sulfide removal is a long-standing economic and environmental challenge faced by the oil and gas industries.

After introducing the main motivation for the development of such processes, we first summarize the most important aspects of CO2 capture and green routes to produce H2. Once the scene in terms of feedstocks is introduced, we carefully summarize the state of the art in the development of heterogeneous catalysts for these important hydrogenation reactions. Finally, in an attempt to give an order of magnitude regarding CO2 valorization, we critically assess economical aspects of the production of methanol and DME and outline future research and development directions.","1249":"Mitochondria are recognized as one of the most important targets for new drug design in cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. Currently, the most effective way to deliver drugs specifically to mitochondria is by covalent linking a lipophilic cation such as an alkyltriphenylphosphonium moiety to a pharmacophore of interest. Other delocalized lipophilic cations, such as rhodamine, natural and synthetic mitochondria-targeting peptides, and nanoparticle vehicles, have also been used for mitochondrial delivery of small molecules. Depending on the approach used, and the cell and mitochondrial membrane potentials, more than 1000-fold higher mitochondrial concentration can be achieved. Mitochondrial targeting has been developed to study mitochondrial physiology and dysfunction and the interaction between mitochondria and other subcellular organelles and for treatment of a variety of diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. In this Review, we discuss efforts to target small-molecule compounds to mitochondria for probing mitochondria function, as diagnostic tools and potential therapeutics. We describe the physicochemical basis for mitochondrial accumulation of lipophilic cations, synthetic chemistry strategies to target compounds to mitochondria, mitochondrial probes, and sensors, and examples of mitochondrial targeting of bioactive compounds. Finally, we review published attempts to apply mitochondria-targeted agents for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.","1250":"Partially fluorinated alkanes, arenes, and alkenes can be transformed by a variety of transition metal and lanthanide systems. Although the C-H bond is weaker than the C-F bond regardless of the hybridization of the carbon, the reaction of the C-F bond at the metal is usually more exothermic than the corresponding reaction of the C-H bonds. Both bonds are activated by the metal systems, but the preference for activating these bonds depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon and of the metal system, so that the reaction can be directed exclusively toward C-H or C-F bonds or yield a mixture of products. Additionally, the presence of fluorine differentiates between C-H bonds at different positions resulting in regioselective C-H bond activation; paradoxically, the strongest C-H bond reacts preferentially. The purpose of this review is to describe the field of reactions of partially fluorinated substrates with transition metal atoms, ions, and molecular complexes. The controlling physical properties (thermodynamics and kinetics) are described first, followed by a description of stoichiometric reactions, with the competition between the C-H and C-F activations as focus. A few representative catalytic systems are discussed. The review also highlights the benefit of combining experimental and theoretical studies.","1251":"The booming field of molecular electronics has fostered a surge of computational research on electronic properties of organic molecular solids. In particular, with respect to a microscopic understanding of transport and loss mechanisms, theoretical studies assume an ever-increasing role. Owing to the tremendous diversity of organic molecular materials, a great number of computational methods have been put forward to suit every possible charge transport regime, material, and need for accuracy. With this review article we aim at providing a compendium of the available methods, their theoretical foundations, and their ranges of validity. We illustrate these through applications found in the literature. The focus is on methods available for organic molecular crystals, but mention is made wherever techniques are suitable for use in other related materials such as disordered or polymeric systems.","1252":"The review highlights the hydantoin syntheses presented from the point of view of the preparation methods.

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\/associated protein 9 (CRISPR\/Cas9) technology can be used to edit single or multiple genes in a wide variety of cell types and organisms in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we review the rapidly developing CRISPR\/Cas9-based technologies for disease modeling and gene correction and recent progress toward Cas9\/guide RNA (gRNA) delivery based on viral and nonviral vectors. We discuss the relative merits of delivering the genome editing elements in the form of DNA, mRNA, or protein, and the opportunities of combining viral delivery of a transgene encoding Cas9 with nonviral delivery of gRNA. We highlight the lessons learned from nonviral gene delivery in the past three decades and consider their applicability for CRISPR\/Cas9 delivery. We also include a discussion of bioinformatics tools for gRNA design and chemical modifications of gRNA. Finally, we consider the extracellular and intracellular barriers to nonviral CRISPR\/Cas9 delivery and propose strategies that may overcome these barriers to realize the clinical potential of CRISPR\/Cas9-based genome editing.","1256":"Research and industrial interest in radical C-H activation\/radical cross-coupling chemistry has continuously grown over the past few decades. These reactions offer fascinating and unconventional approaches toward connecting molecular fragments with high atom- and step-economy that are often complementary to traditional methods. Success in this area of research was made possible through the development of photocatalysis and first-row transition metal catalysis along with the use of peroxides as radical initiators. This Review provides a brief and concise overview of the current status and latest methodologies using radicals or radical cations as key intermediates produced via radical C-H activation. This Review includes radical addition, radical cascade cyclization, radical\/radical cross-coupling, coupling of radicals with M-R groups, and coupling of radical cations with nucleophiles (Nu).","1257":"This review is designed to foster the discussion regarding the viability of postcombustion CO2 capture by water-lean solvents, by separating fact from fiction for both skeptics and advocates. We highlight the unique physical and thermodynamic properties of notable water-lean solvents, with a discussion of how such properties could translate to efficiency gains compared to aqueous amines. The scope of this review ranges from the purely fundamental molecular-level processes that govern solvent behavior to bench-scale testing, through process engineering and projections of process performance and cost. Key discussions of higher than expected CO2 mass transfer, water tolerance, and compatibility with current infrastructure are presented along with current limitations and suggested areas where further solvent development is needed. We conclude with an outlook of the status of the field and assess the viability of water-lean solvents for postcombustion CO2 capture.","1258":"Infectious diseases are a major global health issue. Diagnosis is a critical first step in effectively managing their spread. Paper-based microfluidic diagnostics first emerged in 2007 as a low-cost alternative to conventional laboratory testing, with the goal of improving accessibility to medical diagnostics in developing countries. In this review, we examine the advances in paper-based microfluidic diagnostics for medical diagnosis in the context of global health from 2007 to 2016. The theory of fluid transport in paper is first presented. The next section examines the strategies that have been employed to control fluid and analyte transport in paper-based assays. Tasks such as mixing, timing, and sequential fluid delivery have been achieved in paper and have enabled analytical capabilities comparable to those of conventional laboratory methods. The following section examines paper-based sample processing and analysis. The most impactful advancement here has been the translation of nucleic acid analysis to a paper-based format.

The last core section of the review highlights emerging health applications, such as male fertility testing and wearable diagnostics. We conclude the review with the future outlook, remaining challenges, and emerging opportunities.","1259":"The field of protein conjugation most commonly refers to the chemical, enzymatic, or chemoenzymatic formation of new covalent bonds between two polypeptides, or between a single polypeptide and a new molecule (polymer, small molecule, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, etc.). Due to the modest selectivity of chemical methods for protein conjugation, there are increased efforts to develop biocatalysts that confer regioselectivity for site-specific modification, thereby complementing the existing toolbox of chemical conjugation strategies. This review summarizes key advances in the use of enzymes to functionalize proteins with commercial relevance. The examples put forth have demonstrated value at the industrial level or show promising industrial potential in the laboratory.","1260":"The Nozaki-Hiyama-Takai-Kishi (NHTK) reaction was discovered in the late 1970s and, since then, its main application has been its use in total synthesis.

SERS and TERS use plasmonically enhanced Raman scattering to characterize the chemical information on single molecules. Additionally, TERS can image single molecules with subnanometer spatial resolution. In this review, we cover the development and history of SERS and TERS, including the concept of SERS hot spots and the plasmonic nanostructures necessary for SM detection, the past and current methodologies for verifying SMSERS, and investigations into understanding the signal heterogeneities observed with SMSERS. Moving on to TERS, we cover tip fabrication and the physical origins of the subnanometer spatial resolution.

DNA origami is a technique that uses hundreds of short DNA oligonucleotides, called staple strands, to fold a long single-stranded DNA, which is called a scaffold strand, into various designer nanoscale architectures. DNA origami has dramatically improved the complexity and scalability of DNA nanostructures. Due to its high degree of customization and spatial addressability, DNA origami provides a versatile platform with which to engineer nanoscale structures and devices that can sense, compute, and actuate. These capabilities open up opportunities for a broad range of applications in chemistry, biology, physics, material science, and computer science that have often required programmed spatial control of molecules and atoms in three-dimensional (3D) space.

In the past two decades, many DNA-based metal sensors have emerged. While the main biological role of DNA is to store genetic information, its chemical structure is ideal for metal binding via both the phosphate backbone and nucleobases. DNA is highly stable, cost-effective, easy to modify, and amenable to combinatorial selection. Two main classes of functional DNA were developed for metal sensing: aptamers and DNAzymes. While a few metal binding aptamers are known, it is generally quite difficult to isolate such aptamers. On the other hand, DNAzymes are powerful tools for metal sensing since they are selected based on catalytic activity, thus bypassing the need for metal immobilization. In the last five years, a new surge of development has been made on isolating new metal-sensing DNA sequences. To date, many important metals can be selectively detected by DNA often down to the low parts-per-billion level. Herein, each metal ion and the known DNA sequences for its sensing are reviewed. We focus on the fundamental aspect of metal binding, emphasizing the distinct chemical property of each metal. Instead of reviewing each published sensor, a high-level summary of signaling methods is made as a separate section. In principle, each signaling strategy can be applied to many DNA sequences for designing sensors. Finally, a few specific applications are highlighted, and future research opportunities are discussed.","1267":"One of the grand challenges in chemistry has been to directly observe atomic motions during chemical processes. The depiction of the nuclear configurations in space-time to understand barrier crossing events has served as a unifying intellectual theme connecting the different disciplines of chemistry. This challenge has been cast as an imaging problem in which the technical issues reduce to achieving not only sufficient simultaneous space-time resolution but also brightness for sufficient image contrast to capture the atomic motions. This objective has been met with electrons as the imaging source. The review chronicles the first use of electron structural probes to study reactive intermediates, to the development of high bunch charge electron pulses with sufficient combined spatial-temporal resolution and intensity to literally light up atomic motions, as well as the means to characterize the electron pulses in terms of temporal brightness and image reconstruction. The use of femtosecond Rydberg spectroscopy as a novel means to use internal electron scattering within the molecular reference frame to obtain similar information on reaction dynamics is also discussed. The focus is on atomically resolved chemical reaction dynamics with pertinent references to work in other areas and forms of spectroscopy that provide additional information. Effectively, we can now directly observe the far-from-equilibrium atomic motions involved in barrier crossing and categorize chemistry in terms of a power spectrum of a few dominant reaction modes. It is this reduction in dimensionality that makes chemical reaction mechanisms transferrable to seemingly arbitrarily complex (large N) systems, up to molecules as large as biological macromolecules (N &gt; 1000 atoms). We now have a new way to reformulate reaction mechanisms using an experimentally determined dynamic mode basis that in combination with recent theoretical advances has the potential to lead to a new conceptual basis for chemistry that forms a natural link between structure and dynamics.","1268":"Atomically precise pieces of matter of nanometer dimensions composed of noble metals are new categories of materials with many unusual properties. Over 100 molecules of this kind with formulas such as Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, and Au102(SR)44 as well as Ag25(SR)18, Ag29(S2R)12, and Ag44(SR)30 (often with a few counterions to compensate charges) are known now. They can be made reproducibly with robust synthetic protocols, resulting in colored solutions, yielding powders or diffractable crystals. They are distinctly different from nanoparticles in their spectroscopic properties such as optical absorption and emission, showing well-defined features, just like molecules. They show isotopically resolved molecular ion peaks in mass spectra and provide diverse information when examined through multiple instrumental methods. Most important of these properties is luminescence, often in the visible-near-infrared window, useful in biological applications. Luminescence in the visible region, especially by clusters protected with proteins, with a large Stokes shift, has been used for various sensing applications, down to a few tens of molecules\/ions, in air and water. Catalytic properties of clusters, especially oxidation of organic substrates, have been examined. Materials science of these systems presents numerous possibilities and is fast evolving. Computational insights have given reasons for their stability and unusual properties. The molecular nature of these materials is unequivocally manifested in a few recent studies such as intercluster reactions forming precise clusters. These systems manifest properties of the core, of the ligand shell, as well as that of the integrated system. They are better described as protected molecules or aspicules, where aspis means shield and cules refers to molecules, implying that they are \"shielded molecules\". In order to understand their diverse properties, a nomenclature has been introduced with which it is possible to draw their structures with positional labels on paper, with some training. Research in this area is captured here, based on the publications available up to December 2016.","1269":"The family of hemicelluloses stands out as a very promising natural resource that can be utilized as a biobased materials feedstock.

This Review aims to give a perspective on these issues and demonstrate how the transfer of molecular wood cell interactions into hemicellulose-based materials may offer new design principles for material formulations.","1270":"The application of small molecules as catalysts for the diversification of natural product scaffolds is reviewed. Specifically, principles that relate to the selectivity challenges intrinsic to complex molecular scaffolds are summarized. The synthesis of analogues of natural products by this approach is then described as a quintessential \"late-stage functionalization\" exercise wherein natural products serve as the lead scaffolds. Given the historical application of enzymatic catalysts to the site-selective alteration of complex molecules, the focus of this Review is on the recent studies of nonenzymatic catalysts. Reactions involving hydroxyl group derivatization with a variety of electrophilic reagents are discussed. C-H bond functionalizations that lead to oxidations, aminations, and halogenations are also presented. Several examples of site-selective olefin functionalizations and C-C bond formations are also included. Numerous classes of natural products have been subjected to these studies of site-selective alteration including polyketides, glycopeptides, terpenoids, macrolides, alkaloids, carbohydrates, and others. What emerges is a platform for chemical remodeling of naturally occurring scaffolds that targets virtually all known chemical functionalities and microenvironments. However, challenges for the design of very broad classes of catalysts, with even broader selectivity demands (e.g., stereoselectivity, functional group selectivity, and site-selectivity) persist. Yet, a significant spectrum of powerful, catalytic alterations of complex natural products now exists such that expansion of scope seems inevitable. Several instances of biological activity assays of remodeled natural product derivatives are also presented. These reports may foreshadow further interdisciplinary impacts for catalytic remodeling of natural products, including contributions to SAR development, mode of action studies, and eventually medicinal chemistry.","1271":"Flow chemistry involves the use of channels or tubing to conduct a reaction in a continuous stream rather than in a flask. Flow equipment provides chemists with unique control over reaction parameters enhancing reactivity or in some cases enabling new reactions. This relatively young technology has received a remarkable amount of attention in the past decade with many reports on what can be done in flow. Until recently, however, the question, \"Should we do this in flow?\" has merely been an afterthought. This review introduces readers to the basic principles and fundamentals of flow chemistry and critically discusses recent flow chemistry accounts.","1272":"X-ray scattering is uniquely suited to the study of disordered systems and thus has the potential to provide insight into dynamic processes where diffraction methods fail. In particular, while X-ray crystallography has been a staple of structural biology for more than half a century and will continue to remain so, a major limitation of this technique has been the lack of dynamic information. Solution X-ray scattering has become an invaluable tool in structural and mechanistic studies of biological macromolecules where large conformational changes are involved. Such systems include allosteric enzymes that play key roles in directing metabolic fluxes of biochemical pathways, as well as large, assembly-line type enzymes that synthesize secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, crystallography has the potential to provide information on protein dynamics via the diffuse scattering patterns that are overlaid with Bragg diffraction. Historically, these patterns have been very difficult to interpret, but recent advances in X-ray detection have led to a renewed interest in diffuse scattering analysis as a way to probe correlated motions. Here, we will review X-ray scattering theory and highlight recent advances in scattering-based investigations of protein solutions and crystals, with a particular focus on complex enzymes.","1273":"Great attention has been given to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived solid bases because of their attractive structure and catalytic performance in various organic reactions. The extraordinary skeleton structure of MOFs provides many possibilities for incorporation of diverse basic functionalities, which is unachievable for conventional solid bases. The past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in this vibrant research area; however, MOFs for heterogeneous basic catalysis have never been reviewed until now. Therefore, a review summarizing MOFs-derived base catalysts is highly expected. In this review, we present an overview of the recent progress in MOFs-derived solid bases covering preparation, characterization, and catalytic applications. In the preparation section, the solid bases are divided into two categories, namely, MOFs with intrinsic basicity and MOFs with modified basicity. The basicity can originate from either metal sites or organic ligands. Different approaches used for generation of basic sites are included, and each approach is described with representative examples. The fundamental principles for the design and fabrication of MOFs with basic functionalities are featured. In the characterization section, experimental techniques and theoretical calculations employed for characterization of basic MOFs are summarized. Some representive experimental techniques, such as temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) and infrared (IR) spectra of different probing molecules, are covered. Following preparation and characterization, the catalytic applications of MOFs-derived solid bases are dealt with. These solid bases have potential to catalyze some well-known \"base-catalyzed reactions\" like Knoevenagel condensation, aldol condensation, and Michael addition. Meanwhile, in contrast to conventional solid bases, MOFs show some different catalytic properties due to their special structural and surface properties. Remarkably, characteristic features of MOFs-derived solid bases are described by comparing with conventional inorganic counterparts, keeping in mind the current opportunities and challenges in this field.","1274":"An appropriate level of protein phosphorylation on tyrosine is essential for cells to react to extracellular stimuli and maintain cellular homeostasis. Faulty operation of signal pathways mediated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation causes numerous human diseases, which presents enormous opportunities for therapeutic intervention. While the importance of protein tyrosine kinases in orchestrating the tyrosine phosphorylation networks and in target-based drug discovery has long been recognized, the significance of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in cellular signaling and disease biology has historically been underappreciated, due to a large extent to an erroneous assumption that they are largely constitutive and housekeeping enzymes. Here, we provide a comprehensive examination of a number of regulatory mechanisms, including redox modulation, allosteric regulation, and protein oligomerization, that control PTP activity. These regulatory mechanisms are integral to the myriad PTP-mediated biochemical events and reinforce the concept that PTPs are indispensable and specific modulators of cellular signaling. We also discuss how disruption of these PTP regulatory mechanisms can cause human diseases and how these diverse regulatory mechanisms can be exploited for novel therapeutic development.","1275":"Peptides and proteins are not orally bioavailable in mammals, although a few peptides are intestinally absorbed in small amounts. Polypeptides are generally too large and polar to passively diffuse through lipid membranes, while most known active transport mechanisms facilitate cell uptake of only very small peptides. Systematic evaluations of peptides with molecular weights above 500 Da are needed to identify parameters that influence oral bioavailability. Here we describe 125 cyclic peptides containing four to thirty-seven amino acids that are orally absorbed by mammals. Cyclization minimizes degradation in the gut, blood, and tissues by removing cleavable N- and C-termini and by shielding components from metabolic enzymes. Cyclization also folds peptides into bioactive conformations that determine exposure of polar atoms to solvation by water and lipids and therefore can influence oral bioavailability. Key chemical properties thought to influence oral absorption and bioavailability are analyzed, including molecular weight, octanol-water partitioning, hydrogen bond donors\/acceptors, rotatable bonds, and polar surface area. The cyclic peptides violated to different degrees all of the limits traditionally considered to be important for oral bioavailability of drug-like small molecules, although fewer hydrogen bond donors and reduced flexibility generally favored oral absorption.","1276":"Droplet microfluidics generates and manipulates discrete droplets through immiscible multiphase flows inside microchannels. Due to its remarkable advantages, droplet microfluidics bears significant value in an extremely wide range of area. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth insight into droplet microfluidics, covering fundamental research from microfluidic chip fabrication and droplet generation to the applications of droplets in bio(chemical) analysis and materials generation. The purpose of this review is to convey the fundamentals of droplet microfluidics, a critical analysis on its current status and challenges, and opinions on its future development. We believe this review will promote communications among biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science.","1277":"","1278":"Innovative valorization of naturally abundant and renewable lignocellulosic biomass is of great importance in the pursuit of a sustainable future and biobased economy. Ionic liquids (ILs) as an important kind of green solvents and functional fluids have attracted significant attention for the catalytic transformation of lignocellulosic feedstocks into a diverse range of products. Taking advantage of some unique properties of ILs with different functions, the catalytic transformation processes can be carried out more efficiently and potentially with lower environmental impacts. Also, a new product portfolio may be derived from catalytic systems with ILs as media. This review focuses on the catalytic chemical conversion of lignocellulose and its primary ingredients (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) into value-added chemicals and fuel products using ILs as the reaction media. An outlook is provided at the end of this review to highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with this interesting and important area.","1279":"Owing to their excellent multiplexing ability, high sensitivity, and large dynamic range, immunoassays using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as the readout signal have found prosperous applications in fields such as disease diagnosis, environmental surveillance, and food safety supervision. Various ever-increasing demands have promoted SERS-based immunoassays from the classical sandwich-type ones to those integrated with fascinating automatic platforms (e.g., test strips and microfluidic chips). As recent years have witnessed impressive progress in SERS immunoassays, we try to comprehensively cover SERS-based immunoassays from their basic working principles to specific applications. Focusing on several basic elements in SERS immunoassays, typical structures of SERS nanoprobes, productive optical spectral encoding strategies, and popular immunoassay platforms are highlighted, followed by their representative biological applications in the last 5 years. Moreover, despite the vast advances achieved to date, SERS immunoassays still suffer from some annoying shortcomings. Thus, proposals on how to improve the SERS immunoassay performance are also discussed, as well as future challenges and perspectives, aiming to give brief and valid guidelines for choosing suitable platforms according to particular applications.","1280":"Computational studies on carboxylate-assisted C-H activation and functionalization at group 8-10 transition metal centers are reviewed. This Review is organized by metal and will cover work published from late 2009 until mid-2016. A brief overview of computational work prior to 2010 is also provided, and this outlines the understanding of carboxylate-assisted C-H activation in terms of the \"ambiphilic metal-ligand assistance\" (AMLA) and \"concerted metalation deprotonation\" (CMD) concepts. Computational studies are then surveyed in terms of the nature of the C-H bond being activated (C(sp2)-H or C(sp3)-H), the nature of the process involved (intramolecular with a directing group or intermolecular), and the context (stoichiometric C-H activation or within a variety of catalytic processes). This Review aims to emphasize the connection between computation and experiment and to highlight the contribution of computational chemistry to our understanding of catalytic C-H functionalization based on carboxylate-assisted C-H activation. Some opportunities where the interplay between computation and experiment may contribute further to the areas of catalytic C-H functionalization and applied computational chemistry are identified.","1281":"First-row transition-metal-mediated reactions constitute an important and growing area of research due to the low cost, low toxicity, and exceptional synthetic versatility of these metals. Currently, there is considerable effort to replace existing precious-metal-catalyzed reactions with first-row analogs. More importantly, there are a plethora of unique transformations mediated by first-row metals, which have no classical second- or third-row counterpart. Herein, the application of first-row metal-mediated methods to the total synthesis of natural products is discussed. This Review is intended to highlight strategic uses of these metals to realize efficient syntheses and highlight the future potential of these reagents and catalysts in organic synthesis.","1282":"After three decades of developments, single particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to interrogate dynamics in a range of materials including live cells and novel catalytic supports because of its ability to reveal dynamics in the structure-function relationships underlying the heterogeneous nature of such systems. In this review, we summarize the algorithms behind, and practical applications of, SPT. We first cover the theoretical background including particle identification, localization, and trajectory reconstruction. General instrumentation and recent developments to achieve two- and three-dimensional subdiffraction localization and SPT are discussed. We then highlight some applications of SPT to study various biological and synthetic materials systems. Finally, we provide our perspective regarding several directions for future advancements in the theory and application of SPT.","1283":"The polycyclic furanobutenolide-derived cembranoid and norcembranoid natural products are a family of congested, stereochemically complex, and extensively oxygenated polycyclic diterpenes and norditerpenes. Although the elegant architectures and biological activity profiles of these natural products have captured the attention of chemists since the isolation of the first members of the family in the 1990s, the de novo synthesis of only a single polycyclic furanobutenolide-derived cembranoid and norcembranoid has been accomplished. This article begins with a brief discussion of the proposed biosyntheses and biosynthetic connections among the polycyclic furanobutenolide-derived cembranoids and norcembranoids and then provides a comprehensive review of the synthetic efforts toward each member of the natural product family, including biomimetic, semisynthetic, and de novo synthetic strategies. This body of knowledge has been gathered to provide insight into the reactivity and constraints of these compact and highly oxygenated polycyclic structures, as well as to offer guidance for future synthetic endeavors.","1284":"We review the literature on the use of computational methods to study the reactions between carbon dioxide and aqueous organic amines used to capture CO2 prior to storage, reuse, or sequestration. The focus is largely on the use of high level quantum chemical methods to study these reactions, although the review also summarizes research employing hybrid quantum mechanics\/molecular mechanics methods and molecular dynamics. We critically review the effects of basis set size, quantum chemical method, solvent models, and other factors on the accuracy of calculations to provide guidance on the most appropriate methods, the expected performance, method limitations, and future needs and trends. The review also discusses experimental studies of amine-CO2 equilibria, kinetics, measurement and prediction of amine pKa values, and degradation reactions of aqueous organic amines. Computational simulations of carbon capture reaction mechanisms are also comprehensively described, and the relative merits of the zwitterion, termolecular, carbamic acid, and bicarbonate mechanisms are discussed in the context of computational and experimental studies. Computational methods will become an increasingly valuable and complementary adjunct to experiments for understanding mechanisms of amine-CO2 reactions and in the design of more efficient carbon capture agents with acceptable cost and toxicities.","1285":"Ammonia-lyases and aminomutases are mechanistically and structurally diverse enzymes which catalyze the deamination and\/or isomerization of amino acids in nature by cleaving or shifting a C-N bond. Of the many protein families in which these enzyme activities are found, only a subset have been employed in the synthesis of optically pure fine chemicals or in medical applications. This review covers the natural diversity of these enzymes, highlighting particular enzyme classes that are used within industrial and medical biotechnology. These highlights detail the discovery and mechanistic investigations of these commercially relevant enzymes, along with comparisons of their various applications as stand-alone catalysts, components of artificial biosynthetic pathways and biocatalytic or chemoenzymatic cascades, and therapeutic tools for the potential treatment of various pathologies.","1286":"During S-phase, minor DNA damage may be overcome by DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways that bypass such obstacles, postponing repair of the offending damage to complete the cell cycle and maintain cell survival. In translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), specialized DNA polymerases replicate the damaged DNA, allowing stringent DNA synthesis by a replicative polymerase to resume beyond the offending damage. Dysregulation of this DDT pathway in human cells leads to increased mutation rates that may contribute to the onset of cancer. Furthermore, TLS affords human cancer cells the ability to counteract chemotherapeutic agents that elicit cell death by damaging DNA in actively replicating cells. Currently, it is unclear how this critical pathway unfolds, in particular, where and when TLS occurs on each template strand. Given the semidiscontinuous nature of DNA replication, it is likely that TLS on the leading and lagging strand templates is unique for each strand. Since the discovery of DDT in the late 1960s, most studies on TLS in eukaryotes have focused on DNA lesions resulting from ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. In this review, we revisit these and other related studies to dissect the step-by-step intricacies of this complex process, provide our current understanding of TLS on leading and lagging strand templates, and propose testable hypotheses to gain further insights.","1287":"N-Acyliminium ions are powerful reactive species for the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. Strategies relying on intramolecular reactions of N-acyliminium intermediates, also referred to as N-acyliminium ion cyclization reactions, have been employed for the construction of structurally diverse scaffolds, ranging from simple bicyclic skeletons to complex polycyclic systems and natural-product-like compounds. This review aims to provide an overview of cyclization reactions of N-acyliminium ions derived from various precursors for the assembly of structurally diverse scaffolds, covering the literature over the past 12 years (from 2004 to 2015).","1288":null,"1289":"Ionic liquids (ILs) offer a wide range of promising applications because of their much enhanced properties. However, further development of such materials depends on the fundamental understanding of their hierarchical structures and behaviors, which requires multiscale strategies to provide coupling among various length scales. In this review, we first introduce the structures and properties of these typical ILs. Then, we introduce the multiscale modeling methods that have been applied to the ILs, covering from molecular scale (QM\/MM), to mesoscale (CG, DPD), to macroscale (CFD for unit scale and thermodynamics COSMO-RS model and environmental assessment GD method for process scale). In the following section, we discuss in some detail their applications to the four scales of ILs, including molecular scale structures, mesoscale aggregates and dynamics, and unit scale reactor design and process design and optimization of typical IL applications. Finally, we address the concluding remarks of multiscale strategies in the understanding and predictive capabilities of ILs. The present review aims to summarize the recent advances in the fundamental and application understanding of ILs.","1290":"Privileged structures have been widely used as an effective template in medicinal chemistry for drug discovery. Chalcone is a common simple scaffold found in many naturally occurring compounds. Many chalcone derivatives have also been prepared due to their convenient synthesis. These natural products and synthetic compounds have shown numerous interesting biological activities with clinical potentials against various diseases. This review aims to highlight the recent evidence of chalcone as a privileged scaffold in medicinal chemistry. Multiple aspects of chalcone will be summarized herein, including the isolation of novel chalcone derivatives, the development of new synthetic methodologies, the evaluation of their biological properties, and the exploration of the mechanisms of action as well as target identification. This review is expected to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical review of the chalcone template to the chemistry community.","1291":"Advances in attosecond science have led to a wealth of important discoveries in atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics and are progressively directing their footsteps toward problems of chemical interest. Relevant technical achievements in the generation and application of extreme-ultraviolet subfemtosecond pulses, the introduction of experimental techniques able to follow in time the electron dynamics in quantum systems, and the development of sophisticated theoretical methods for the interpretation of the outcomes of such experiments have raised a continuous growing interest in attosecond phenomena, as demonstrated by the vast literature on the subject. In this review, after introducing the physical mechanisms at the basis of attosecond pulse generation and attosecond technology and describing the theoretical tools that complement experimental research in this field, we will concentrate on the application of attosecond methods to the investigation of ultrafast processes in molecules, with emphasis in molecules of chemical and biological interest. The measurement and control of electronic motion in complex molecular structures is a formidable challenge, for both theory and experiment, but will indubitably have a tremendous impact on chemistry in the years to come.","1292":"The review compiles artificial cascades involving enzymes with a focus on the last 10 years. A cascade is defined as the combination of at least two reaction steps in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the intermediates, whereby at least one step is catalyzed by an enzyme. Additionally, cascades performed in vivo and in vitro are discussed separately, whereby in vivo cascades are defined here as cascades relying on cofactor recycling by the metabolism or on a metabolite from the living organism. The review introduces a systematic classification of the cascades according to the number of enzymes in the linear sequence and differentiates between cascades involving exclusively enzymes and combinations of enzymes with non-natural catalysts or chemical steps. Since the number of examples involving two enzymes is predominant, the two enzyme cascades are further subdivided according to the number, order, and type of redox steps. Furthermore, this classification differentiates between cascades where all reaction steps are performed simultaneously, sequentially, or in flow.","1293":"Efficient access to chemical information contained in scientific literature, patents, technical reports, or the web is a pressing need shared by researchers and patent attorneys from different chemical disciplines. Retrieval of important chemical information in most cases starts with finding relevant documents for a particular chemical compound or family. Targeted retrieval of chemical documents is closely connected to the automatic recognition of chemical entities in the text, which commonly involves the extraction of the entire list of chemicals mentioned in a document, including any associated information. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth description of fundamental concepts, technical implementations, and current technologies for meeting these information demands. A strong focus is placed on community challenges addressing systems performance, more particularly CHEMDNER and CHEMDNER patents tasks of BioCreative IV and V, respectively. Considering the growing interest in the construction of automatically annotated chemical knowledge bases that integrate chemical information and biological data, cheminformatics approaches for mapping the extracted chemical names into chemical structures and their subsequent annotation together with text mining applications for linking chemistry with biological information are also presented. Finally, future trends and current challenges are highlighted as a roadmap proposal for research in this emerging field.","1294":"The quest for an efficient process to convert methane efficiently to fuels and high value-added chemicals such as olefins and aromatics is motivated by their increasing demands and recently discovered large reserves and resources of methane. Direct conversion to these chemicals can be realized either oxidatively via oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) or nonoxidatively via methane dehydroaromatization (MDA), which have been under intensive investigation for decades. While industrial applications are still limited by their low yield (selectivity) and stability issues, innovations in new catalysts and concepts are needed. The newly emerging strategy using iron single sites to catalyze methane conversion to olefins, aromatics, and hydrogen (MTOAH) attracted much attention when it was reported. Because the challenge lies in controlled dehydrogenation of the highly stable CH4 and selective C-C coupling, we focus mainly on the fundamentals of C-H activation and analyze the reaction pathways toward selective routes of OCM, MDA, and MTOAH. With this, we intend to provide some insights into their reaction mechanisms and implications for future development of highly selective catalysts for direct conversion of methane to high value-added chemicals.","1295":"Complex molecular architectures containing cyclopropanes present significant challenges for any synthetic chemist. This review aims to highlight the strategic considerations for introduction of the cyclopropane motif in a collection of recent total syntheses. At first, an overview of the most important and widely used cyclopropanation techniques is presented, followed by a discussion of elegant approaches and clever solutions that have been developed to enable the synthesis of various unique cyclopropane natural products or use of cyclopropanes as versatile strategic intermediates.","1296":"Nature has evolved halogenase enzymes to regioselectively halogenate a diverse range of biosynthetic precursors, with the halogens introduced often having a profound effect on the biological activity of the resulting natural products. Synthetic endeavors to create non-natural bioactive small molecules for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications have also arrived at a similar conclusion: halogens can dramatically improve the properties of organic molecules for selective modulation of biological targets in vivo. Consequently, a high proportion of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals on the market today possess halogens. Halogenated organic compounds are also common intermediates in synthesis and are particularly valuable in metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Despite the potential utility of organohalogens, traditional nonenzymatic halogenation chemistry utilizes deleterious reagents and often lacks regiocontrol. Reliable, facile, and cleaner methods for the regioselective halogenation of organic compounds are therefore essential in the development of economical and environmentally friendly industrial processes. A potential avenue toward such methods is the use of halogenase enzymes, responsible for the biosynthesis of halogenated natural products, as biocatalysts. This Review will discuss advances in developing halogenases for biocatalysis, potential untapped sources of such biocatalysts and how further optimization of these enzymes is required to achieve the goal of industrial scale biohalogenation.","1297":"Selective oxidation has an important role in environmental and green chemistry (e.g., oxidative desulfurization of fuels and oxidative removal of mercury) as well as chemicals and intermediates chemistry to obtain high-value-added special products (e.g., organic sulfoxides and sulfones, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, epoxides, esters, and lactones). Due to their unique physical properties such as the nonvolatility, thermal stability, nonexplosion, high polarity, and temperature-dependent miscibility with water, ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted considerable attention as reaction solvents and media for selective oxidations and are considered as green alternatives to volatile organic solvents. Moreover, for easy separation and recyclable utilization, IL catalysts have attracted unprecedented attention as \"biphasic catalyst\" or \"immobilized catalyst\" by immobilizing metal- or nonmetal-containing ILs onto mineral or polymer supports to combine the unique properties of ILs (chemical and thermal stability, capacity for extraction of polar substrates and reaction products) with the extended surface of the supports. This review highlights the most recent outcomes on ILs in several important typical oxidation reactions. The contents are arranged in the series of oxidation of sulfides, oxidation of alcohols, epoxidation of alkenes, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction, oxidation of alkanes, and oxidation of other compounds step by step involving ILs as solvents, catalysts, reagents, or their combinations.","1298":"One of the remaining \"grand challenges\" in chemistry is the development of a next generation, less expensive, cleaner process that can allow the vast reserves of methane from natural gas to augment or replace oil as the source of fuels and chemicals. Homogeneous (gas\/liquid) systems that convert methane to functionalized products with emphasis on reports after 1995 are reviewed. Gas\/solid, bioinorganic, biological, and reaction systems that do not specifically involve methane functionalization are excluded. The various reports are grouped under the main element involved in the direct reactions with methane. Central to the review is classification of the various reports into 12 categories based on both practical considerations and the mechanisms of the elementary reactions with methane. Practical considerations are based on whether or not the system reported can directly or indirectly utilize O2 as the only net coreactant based only on thermodynamic potentials. Mechanistic classifications are based on whether the elementary reactions with methane proceed by chain or nonchain reactions and with stoichiometric reagents or catalytic species. The nonchain reactions are further classified as CH activation (CHA) or CH oxidation (CHO). The bases for these various classifications are defined. In particular, CHA reactions are defined as elementary reactions with methane that result in a discrete methyl intermediate where the formal oxidation state (FOS) on the carbon remains unchanged at -IV relative to that in methane. In contrast, CHO reactions are defined as elementary reactions with methane where the carbon atom of the product is oxidized and has a FOS less negative than -IV. This review reveals that the bulk of the work in the field is relatively evenly distributed across most of the various areas classified. However, a few areas are only marginally examined, or not examined at all. This review also shows that, while significant scientific progress has been made, greater advances, particularly in developing systems that can utilize O2, will be required to develop a practical process that can replace the current energy and capital intensive natural gas conversion process. We believe that this classification scheme will provide the reader with a rapid way to identify systems of interest while providing a deeper appreciation and understanding, both practical and fundamental, of the extensive literature on methane functionalization. The hope is that this could accelerate progress toward meeting this \"grand challenge.\"","1299":"This review discusses a relatively new technique for optical nanoimaging at visible wavelength, known as tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). This technique relies on the enhancement and spatial confinement of light in the close vicinity of the apex of a plasmonic nanotip. The plasmonic nanotip can be positioned on the sample and controlled by a suitable scanning probe microscopy, such as atomic force microscopy or scanning tunneling microscopy. By raster scanning the nanotip, one can obtain nanoimages with high spatial resolution. While enhancement helps measuring weak phonon modes from a tiny volume of the sample, confinement delivers extremely high spatial resolution in nanoimaging. We will discuss the technique of TERS in more detail with several applications and review the recent advances.","1300":"Azines, which are six-membered aromatic compounds containing one or more nitrogen atoms, serve as ubiquitous structural cores of aromatic species with important applications in biological and materials sciences. Among a variety of synthetic approaches toward azines, C-H functionalization represents the most rapid and atom-economical transformation, and it is advantageous for the late-stage functionalization of azine-containing functional molecules. Since azines have several C-H bonds with different reactivities, the development of new reactions that allow for the functionalization of azines in a regioselective fashion has comprised a central issue. This review describes recent advances in the C-H functionalization of azines categorized as follows: (1) SNAr reactions, (2) radical reactions, (3) deprotonation\/functionalization, and (4) metal-catalyzed reactions.","1301":"Chemical synthesis is a well established route for producing many chemicals on a large scale, but some drawbacks still exist in this process, such as unstable intermediates, multistep reactions, complex process control, etc. Biobased production provides an attractive alternative to these challenges, but how to make cells into efficient factories is challenging. As a key enabling technology to develop efficient cell factories, design-construction-evaluation-optimization (DCEO) biotechnology, which incorporates the concepts and techniques of pathway design, pathway construction, pathway evaluation, and pathway optimization at the systems level, offers a conceptual and technological framework to exploit potential pathways, modify existing pathways and create new pathways for the optimal production of desired chemicals. Here, we summarize recent progress of DCEO biotechnology and examples of its application, and provide insights as to when, what and how different strategies should be taken. In addition, we highlight future perspectives of DCEO biotechnology for the successful establishment of biorefineries.","1302":"","1303":"[4 + 2]-Cycloadditions are increasingly being recognized in the biosynthetic pathways of many structurally complex natural products. A relatively small collection of enzymes from these pathways have been demonstrated to increase rates of cyclization and impose stereochemical constraints on the reactions. While mechanistic investigation of these enzymes is just beginning, recent studies have provided new insights with implications for understanding their biosynthetic roles, mechanisms of catalysis, and evolutionary origin.","1304":"A review of efforts that have provided total syntheses of vancomycin and related glycopeptide antibiotics, their agylcons, and key analogues is provided. It is a tribute to developments in organic chemistry and the field of organic synthesis that not only can molecules of this complexity be prepared today by total synthesis but such efforts can be extended to the preparation of previously inaccessible key analogues that contain deep-seated structural changes. With the increasing prevalence of acquired bacterial resistance to existing classes of antibiotics and with the emergence of vancomycin-resistant pathogens (VRSA and VRE), the studies pave the way for the examination of synthetic analogues rationally designed to not only overcome vancomycin resistance but provide the foundation for the development of even more powerful and durable antibiotics.","1305":"Hypoxia development in tumor is closely associated with its increased aggressiveness and strong resistance to therapy, leading to the poor prognosis in several cancer types. Clinically, invasive oxygen microelectrode and high dosage radiotherapy are often utilized to accurately detect and effectively fight hypoxia. Recently, however, there has been a surge of interdisciplinary research aiming at developing functional molecules and nanomaterials that can be used to noninvasively image and efficiently treat hypoxic tumors. In this review, we will provide an overview of the reports published to date on the imaging and therapy of hypoxic tumors. First, we will present the design concepts and engineering of various hypoxia-responsive probes that can be applied to image hypoxia noninvasively, in an order of fluorescent imaging, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and photoacoustic imaging. Then, we will summarize the up-to-date functional nanomaterials which can be used for the effective treatments of tumor hypoxia. The well-established chemical functions of these elaborately designed nanostructures will enable clinicians to adopt specific treatment concepts by overcoming or even utilizing hypoxia. Finally, challenges and future perspectives facing the researchers in the field will be discussed.","1306":null,"1307":"Sulfur plays a critical role for the development and maintenance of life on earth, which is reflected by the wealth of primary metabolites, macromolecules, and cofactors bearing this element. Whereas a large body of knowledge has existed for sulfur trafficking in primary metabolism, the secondary metabolism involving sulfur has long been neglected. Yet, diverse sulfur functionalities have a major impact on the biological activities of natural products. Recent research at the genetic, biochemical, and chemical levels has unearthed a broad range of enzymes, sulfur shuttles, and chemical mechanisms for generating carbon-sulfur bonds. This Review will give the first systematic overview on enzymes catalyzing the formation of organosulfur natural products.","1308":"Synthetic vesicles have been assembled and coassembled from phospholipids, their modified versions, and other single amphiphiles into liposomes, and from block copolymers into polymersomes. Their time-consuming synthesis and preparation as stable, monodisperse, and biocompatible liposomes and polymersomes called for the elaboration of new synthetic methodologies. Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (JDs) and glycodendrimers (JGDs) represent the most recent self-assembling amphiphiles capable of forming monodisperse, stable, and multifunctional unilamellar and multilamellar onion-like vesicles denoted dendrimersomes (DSs) and glycodendrimersomes (GDSs), dendrimercubosomes (DCs), glycodendrimercubosomes (GDCs), and other complex architectures. Amphiphilic JDs consist of hydrophobic dendrons connected to hydrophilic dendrons and can be thought of as monodisperse oligomers of a single amphiphile. They can be functionalized with a variety of molecules such as dyes, and, in the case of JGDs, with carbohydrates. Their iterative modular synthesis provides efficient access to sequence control at the molecular level, resulting in topologies with specific epitope sequence and density. DSs, GDSs, and other architectures from JDs and JGDs serve as powerful tools for mimicking biological membranes and for biomedical applications such as targeted drug and gene delivery and theranostics. This Review covers all aspects of the synthesis of JDs and JGDs and their biological activity and applications after assembly in aqueous media.","1309":"Solution-processed organic films are a facile route to high-speed, low cost, large-area deposition of electrically functional components (transistors, solar cells, emitters, etc.) that can enable a diversity of emerging technologies, from Industry 4.0, to the Internet of things, to point-of-use heath care and elder care. The extreme sensitivity of the functional performance of organic films to structure and the general nonequilibrium nature of solution drying result in extreme processing-performance correlations. In this Review, we highlight insights into the fundamentals of solution-based film deposition afforded by recent state-of-the-art in situ measurements of functional film drying. Emphasis is placed on multimodal studies that combine surface-sensitive X-ray scattering (GIWAXS or GISAXS) with optical characterization to clearly define the evolution of solute structure (aggregation, crystallinity, and morphology) with film thickness.","1310":"Super-resolution microscopy provides direct insight into fundamental biological processes occurring at length scales smaller than light's diffraction limit. The analysis of data at such scales has brought statistical and machine learning methods into the mainstream. Here we provide a survey of data analysis methods starting from an overview of basic statistical techniques underlying the analysis of super-resolution and, more broadly, imaging data. We subsequently break down the analysis of super-resolution data into four problems: the localization problem, the counting problem, the linking problem, and what we've termed the interpretation problem.","1311":"Phytochrome photoreceptors absorb far-red and near-infrared (NIR) light and regulate light responses in plants, fungi, and bacteria. Their multidomain structure and autocatalytic incorporation of linear tetrapyrrole chromophores make phytochromes attractive molecular templates for the development of light-sensing probes. A subclass of bacterial phytochromes (BphPs) utilizes heme-derived biliverdin tetrapyrrole, which is ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, as a chromophore. Because biliverdin possesses the largest electron-conjugated chromophore system among linear tetrapyrroles, BphPs exhibit the most NIR-shifted spectra that reside within the NIR tissue transparency window. Here we analyze phytochrome structure and photochemistry to describe the molecular mechanisms by which they function. We then present strategies to engineer BphP-based NIR fluorescent proteins and review their properties and applications in modern imaging technologies. We next summarize designs of reporters and biosensors and describe their use in the detection of protein-protein interactions, proteolytic activities, and posttranslational modifications. Finally, we provide an overview of optogenetic tools developed from phytochromes and describe their use in light-controlled cell signaling, gene expression, and protein localization. Our review provides guidelines for the selection of NIR probes and tools for noninvasive imaging, sensing, and light-manipulation applications, specifically focusing on probes developed for use in mammalian cells and in vivo.","1312":"","1313":"This review captures the synthesis, assembly, properties, and applications of copper chalcogenide NCs, which have achieved significant research interest in the last decade due to their compositional and structural versatility. The outstanding functional properties of these materials stems from the relationship between their band structure and defect concentration, including charge carrier concentration and electronic conductivity character, which consequently affects their optoelectronic, optical, and plasmonic properties. This, combined with several metastable crystal phases and stoichiometries and the low energy of formation of defects, makes the reproducible synthesis of these materials, with tunable parameters, remarkable. Further to this, the review captures the progress of the hierarchical assembly of these NCs, which bridges the link between their discrete and collective properties. Their ubiquitous application set has cross-cut energy conversion (photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics), energy storage (lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen generation), emissive materials (plasmonics, LEDs, biolabelling), sensors (electrochemical, biochemical), biomedical devices (magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray computer tomography), and medical therapies (photochemothermal therapies, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and drug delivery). The confluence of advances in the synthesis, assembly, and application of these NCs in the past decade has the potential to significantly impact society, both economically and environmentally.","1314":"This Review focuses on research oriented toward elucidation of the various aspects that determine adsorption of CO2 in metal-organic frameworks and its separation from gas mixtures found in industrial processes. It includes theoretical, experimental, and combined approaches able to characterize the materials, investigate the adsorption\/desorption\/reaction properties of the adsorbates inside such environments, screen and design new materials, and analyze additional factors such as material regenerability, stability, effects of impurities, and cost among several factors that influence the effectiveness of the separations. CO2 adsorption, separations, and membranes are reviewed followed by an analysis of the effects of stability, impurities, and process operation conditions on practical applications.","1315":"","1316":"The enzymology of 135 assembly lines containing primarily cis-acyltransferase modules is comprehensively analyzed, with greater attention paid to less common phenomena. Diverse online transformations, in which the substrate and\/or product of the reaction is an acyl chain bound to an acyl carrier protein, are classified so that unusual reactions can be compared and underlying assembly-line logic can emerge. As a complement to the chemistry surrounding the loading, extension, and offloading of assembly lines that construct primarily polyketide products, structural aspects of the assembly-line machinery itself are considered. This review of assembly-line phenomena, covering the literature up to 2017, should thus be informative to the modular polyketide synthase novice and expert alike.","1317":"Phosphorescence is a phenomenon of delayed luminescence that corresponds to the radiative decay of the molecular triplet state. As a general property of molecules, phosphorescence represents a cornerstone problem of chemical physics due to the spin prohibition of the underlying triplet-singlet emission and because its analysis embraces a deep knowledge of electronic molecular structure. Phosphorescence is the simplest physical process which provides an example of spin-forbidden transformation with a characteristic spin selectivity and magnetic field dependence, being the model also for more complicated chemical reactions and for spin catalysis applications. The bridging of the spin prohibition in phosphorescence is commonly analyzed by perturbation theory, which considers the intensity borrowing from spin-allowed electronic transitions. In this review, we highlight the basic theoretical principles and computational aspects for the estimation of various phosphorescence parameters, like intensity, radiative rate constant, lifetime, polarization, zero-field splitting, and spin sublevel population. Qualitative aspects of the phosphorescence phenomenon are discussed in terms of concepts like structure-activity relationships, donor-acceptor interactions, vibronic activity, and the role of spin-orbit coupling under charge-transfer perturbations. We illustrate the theory and principles of computational phosphorescence by highlighting studies of classical examples like molecular nitrogen and oxygen, benzene, naphthalene and their azaderivatives, porphyrins, as well as by reviewing current research on systems like electrophosphorescent transition metal complexes, nucleobases, and amino acids. We furthermore discuss modern studies of phosphorescence that cover topics of applied relevance, like the design of novel photofunctional materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaic cells, chemical sensors, and bioimaging.","1318":"The structure elucidation, biosynthesis, and biological activity of marine carbotricyclic sesquiterpene compounds are reviewed from the pioneering results to the end of 2015. Their total syntheses with a particular emphasis on the first syntheses, enantiomeric versions, and syntheses that led to the revision of structures or stereochemistries are summarized. Overall, 284 tricyclic compounds are classified into fused, bridged, and miscellaneous structures based on 54 different skeletal types. Tricyclic sesquiterpenes constitute an important group of natural products. Their structural diversity and biological activities have generated further interest in the field of drug discovery research, although the exact mechanisms of action of these species are not well known. Furthermore, these tricyclic structures, according to their chemical complexity, are a source of inspiration for chemists in the field of total synthesis for the development of innovative methodologies.","1319":"Catalytic C-H bond activation, which was an elusive subject of chemical research until the 1990s, has now become a standard synthetic method for the formation of new C-C and C-heteroatom bonds. The synthetic potential of C-H activation was first described for ruthenium catalysis and is now widely exploited by the use of various precious metals. Driven by the increasing interest in chemical utilization of ubiquitous metals that are abundant and nontoxic, iron catalysis has become a rapidly growing area of research, and iron-catalyzed C-H activation has been most actively explored in recent years. In this review, we summarize the development of stoichiometric C-H activation, which has a long history, and catalytic C-H functionalization, which emerged about 10 years ago. We focus in this review on reactions that take place via reactive organoiron intermediates, and we excluded those that use iron as a Lewis acid or radical initiator. The contents of this review are categorized by the type of C-H bond cleaved and the type of bond formed thereafter, and it covers the reactions of simple substrates and substrates possessing a directing group that anchors the catalyst to the substrate, providing an overview of iron-mediated and iron-catalyzed C-H activation reported in the literature by October 2016.","1320":"We present an overview of studies on the ultrafast dynamics of water at aqueous interfaces carried out by time-resolved vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopies. This research field has been growing rapidly, stimulated by technical developments achieved recently. In this review, first, the principles and instrumentations are described for conventional VSFG, heterodyne-detected VSFG, and various IR-pump\/VSFG-probe techniques, namely, time-resolved conventional VSFG, time-resolved heterodyne-detected VSFG, and their extension to two-dimensional spectroscopy. Second, the applications of these time-resolved VSFG techniques to the study of the femtosecond vibrational dynamics of water at various interfaces are discussed, in the order of silica\/water, charged monolayer\/water, and the air\/water interfaces. These studies demonstrate that there exists water dynamics specific to the interfaces and that time-resolved VSFG spectroscopies can unambiguously detect such unique dynamics in an interface-selective manner. In particular, the most recent time-resolved heterodyne-detected VSFG and two-dimensional heterodyne-detected VSFG unveil the inhomogeneity of the hydrogen bond and relevant vibrational dynamics of interfacial water through unambiguous observation of hole-burning in the OH stretch band, as well as the subsequent spectral diffusion in the femtosecond time region. These time-resolved VSFG studies have also left several issues for discussion. We describe not only the obtained conclusive physical insights into interfacial water dynamics but also the points left unclear or controversial. A new type of experiment that utilizes UV excitation is also described briefly. Lastly, the summary and some future perspectives of time-resolved VSFG spectroscopies are given.","1321":"Natural products that contain functional groups with heteroatom-heteroatom linkages (X-X, where X = N, O, S, and P) are a small yet intriguing group of metabolites. The reactivity and diversity of these structural motifs has captured the interest of synthetic and biological chemists alike. Functional groups containing X-X bonds are found in all major classes of natural products and often impart significant biological activity. This review presents our current understanding of the biosynthetic logic and enzymatic chemistry involved in the construction of X-X bond containing functional groups within natural products. Elucidating and characterizing biosynthetic pathways that generate X-X bonds could both provide tools for biocatalysis and synthetic biology, as well as guide efforts to uncover new natural products containing these structural features.","1322":"Temperature-responsive ionic liquids (ILs), their fundanmental behaviors, and catalytic applications were introduced, especially the concepts of upper critical solution temperature (UCST) and lower critical solution temperature (LCST). It is described that, during a catalytic reaction, they form a homogeneous mixture with the reactants and products at reaction temperature but separate from them afterward at ambient conditions. It is shown that this behavior offers an effective alternative approach to overcome gas\/liquid-solid interface mass transfer limitations in many catalytic transformations. It should be noted that IL-based thermomorphic systems are rarely elaborated until now, especially in the field of catalytic applications. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review about thermomorphic mixtures of an IL with H2O and\/or organic compounds. Special focus is laid on their temperature dependence concerning UCST and LCST behavior, including systems with conventional ILs, metal-containing ILs, polymerized ILs, as well as the thermomorphic behavior induced via host-guest complexation. A wide range of applications using thermoregulated IL systems in chemical catalytic reactions as well as enzymatic catalysis were also demonstrated in detail. The conclusion is drawn that, due to their highly attractive behavior, thermoregulated ILs have already and will find more applications, not only in catalysis but also in other areas.","1323":"Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool widely used in research and industry for a label-free and unambiguous identification of molecular species. Inconveniently, its application to spectroscopic analysis of minute amounts of materials, for example, in sensing applications, is hampered by the low infrared absorption cross-sections. Surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy using resonant metal nanoantennas, or short \"resonant SEIRA\", overcomes this limitation. Resonantly excited, such metal nanostructures feature collective oscillations of electrons (plasmons), providing huge electromagnetic fields on the nanometer scale. Infrared vibrations of molecules located in these fields are enhanced by orders of magnitude enabling a spectroscopic characterization with unprecedented sensitivity. In this Review, we introduce the concept of resonant SEIRA and discuss the underlying physics, particularly, the resonant coupling between molecular and antenna excitations as well as the spatial extent of the enhancement and its scaling with frequency. On the basis of these fundamentals, different routes to maximize the SEIRA enhancement are reviewed including the choice of nanostructures geometries, arrangements, and materials. Furthermore, first applications such as the detection of proteins, the monitoring of dynamic processes, and hyperspectral infrared chemical imaging are discussed, demonstrating the sensitivity and broad applicability of resonant SEIRA.","1324":null,"1325":"Post-translational modifications of histones by protein methyltransferases (PMTs) and histone demethylases (KDMs) play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and transcription and are implicated in cancer and many other diseases. Many of these enzymes also target various nonhistone proteins impacting numerous crucial biological pathways. Given their key biological functions and implications in human diseases, there has been a growing interest in assessing these enzymes as potential therapeutic targets. Consequently, discovering and developing inhibitors of these enzymes has become a very active and fast-growing research area over the past decade. In this review, we cover the discovery, characterization, and biological application of inhibitors of PMTs and KDMs with emphasis on key advancements in the field. We also discuss challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this emerging, exciting research field.","1326":"Raman scattering microscopy is becoming one of the hot topics in analytical microscopy as a tool for analyzing advanced nanomaterials, such as biomolecules in a live cell for the study of cellular dynamics, semiconductor devices for characterizing strain distribution and contamination, and nanocarbons and nano-2D materials. In this paper, we review the recent progress in the development of Raman scattering microscopy from the viewpoint of spatial resolution and scattering efficiency. To overcome the extremely small cross section of Raman scattering, we discuss three approaches for the enhancement of scattering efficiency and show that the scattering enhancement synergistically increases the spatial resolution. We discuss the mechanisms of tip-enhanced Raman scattering, deep-UV resonant Raman scattering, and coherent nonlinear Raman scattering for micro- and nanoscope applications. The combinations of these three approaches are also shown as nanometer-resolution Raman scattering microscopy. The critical issues of the structures, materials, and reproducibility of tips and three-dimensionality for TERS; photodegradation for resonant Raman scattering; and laser availability for coherent nonlinear Raman scattering are also discussed.","1327":"Biomass is increasingly perceived as a renewable resource rather than as an organic solid waste today, as it can be converted to various chemicals, biofuels, and solid biochar using modern processes. In the past few years, pyrolysis has attracted growing interest as a promising versatile platform to convert biomass into valuable resources. However, an efficient and selective conversion process is still difficult to be realized due to the complex nature of biomass, which usually makes the products complicated. Furthermore, various contaminants and inorganic elements (e.g., heavy metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine) embodied in biomass may be transferred into pyrolysis products or released into the environment, arousing environmental pollution concerns. Understanding their behaviors in biomass pyrolysis is essential to optimizing the pyrolysis process for efficient resource recovery and less environmental pollution. However, there is no comprehensive review so far about the fates of chemical elements in biomass during its pyrolysis. Here, we provide a critical review about the fates of main chemical elements (C, H, O, N, P, Cl, S, and metals) in biomass during its pyrolysis. We overview the research advances about the emission, transformation, and distribution of elements in biomass pyrolysis, discuss the present challenges for resource-oriented conversion and pollution abatement, highlight the importance and significance of understanding the fate of elements during pyrolysis, and outlook the future development directions for process control. The review provides useful information for developing sustainable biomass pyrolysis processes with an improved efficiency and selectivity as well as minimized environmental impacts, and encourages more research efforts from the scientific communities of chemistry, the environment, and energy.","1328":"Since the discovery of mechanically exfoliated graphene in 2004, research on ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. Highlighting their compelling physical, chemical, electronic, and optical properties, as well as their various potential applications, in this Review, we summarize the state-of-art progress on the ultrathin 2D nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on their recent advances. First, we introduce the unique advances on ultrathin 2D nanomaterials, followed by the description of their composition and crystal structures. The assortments of their synthetic methods are then summarized, including insights on their advantages and limitations, alongside some recommendations on suitable characterization techniques. We also discuss in detail the utilization of these ultrathin 2D nanomaterials for wide ranges of potential applications among the electronics\/optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, photocatalysis, and sensing platforms. Finally, the challenges and outlooks in this promising field are featured on the basis of its current development.","1329":"Optical super-resolution imaging has gained momentum in investigations of heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions at the single-molecule level. Thanks to its exceptional spatial resolution and ability to monitor dynamic systems, much detailed information on single-molecule reaction\/adsorption processes and single-particle catalytic processes has been revealed, including chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics; active-site distributions on single-particle surfaces; and size-, shape-, and facet-dependent catalytic activities of individual nanocatalysts. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in super-resolution chemical imaging of surface reactions.","1330":"Smelling is one of the five senses, which plays an important role in our everyday lives. Volatile compounds are, for example, characteristics of food where some of them can be perceivable by humans because of their aroma. They have a great influence on the decision making of consumers when they choose to use a product or not. In the case where a product has an offensive and strong aroma, many consumers might not appreciate it. On the contrary, soft and fresh natural aromas definitely increase the acceptance of a given product. These properties can drastically influence the economy; thus, it has been of great importance to manufacturers that the aroma of their food product is characterized by analytical means to provide a basis for further optimization processes. A lot of research has been devoted to this domain in order to link the quality of, e.g., a food to its aroma. By knowing the aromatic profile of a food, one can understand the nature of a given product leading to developing new products, which are more acceptable by consumers. There are two ways to analyze volatiles: one is to use human senses and\/or sensory instruments, and the other is based on advanced analytical techniques. This work focuses on the latter. Although requirements are simple, low-cost technology is an attractive research target in this domain; most of the data are generated with very high-resolution analytical instruments. Such data gathered based on different analytical instruments normally have broad, overlapping sensitivity profiles and require substantial data analysis. In this review, we have addressed not only the question of the application of chemometrics for aroma analysis but also of the use of different analytical instruments in this field, highlighting the research needed for future focus.","1331":"The conversion of electric power to light is an important scientific and technological challenge. Advanced experimental methods have provided access to explore the relevant microscopic processes at the nanometer scale. Here, we review state-of-the-art studies of electroluminescence induced on the molecular scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. We discuss the generation of excited electronic states and electron-hole pairs (excitons) at molecular interfaces and address interactions between electronic states, local electromagnetic fields (tip-induced plasmons), and molecular vibrations. The combination of electronic and optical spectroscopies with atomic-scale spatial resolution is able to provide a comprehensive picture of energy conversion at the molecular level. A recently developed aspect is the characterization of electroluminescence emitters as quantum light sources, which can be studied with high time resolution, thus providing access to picosecond dynamics at the atomic scale.","1332":"The pool of abundant chiral terpene building blocks (i.e., \"chiral pool terpenes\") has long served as a starting point for the chemical synthesis of complex natural products, including many terpenes themselves. As inexpensive and versatile starting materials, such compounds continue to influence modern synthetic chemistry. This review highlights 21st century terpene total syntheses which themselves use small, terpene-derived materials as building blocks. An outlook to the future of research in this area is highlighted as well.","1333":"Super-resolution fluorescence imaging by photoactivation or photoswitching of single fluorophores and position determination (single-molecule localization microscopy, SMLM) provides microscopic images with subdiffraction spatial resolution. This technology has enabled new insights into how proteins are organized in a cellular context, with a spatial resolution approaching virtually the molecular level. A unique strength of SMLM is that it delivers molecule-resolved information, along with super-resolved images of cellular structures. This allows quantitative access to cellular structures, for example, how proteins are distributed and organized and how they interact with other biomolecules. Ultimately, it is even possible to determine protein numbers in cells and the number of subunits in a protein complex. SMLM thus has the potential to pave the way toward a better understanding of how cells function at the molecular level. In this review, we describe how SMLM has contributed new knowledge in eukaryotic biology, and we specifically focus on quantitative biological data extracted from SMLM images.","1334":"The most fundamental concepts in chemistry are structure, energetics, reactivity and their inter-relationships, which are indispensable for promoting chemistry into a rational science. In this regard, bond energy, the intrinsic determinant directly related to structure and reactivity, should be most essential in serving as a quantitative basis for the design and understanding of organic transformations. Although C-H activation\/functionalization have drawn tremendous research attention and flourished during the past decades, understanding the governing rules of bond energetics in these processes is still fragmentary and seems applicable only to limited cases, such as metal-oxo-mediated hydrogen atom abstraction. Despite the complexity of C-H activation\/functionalization and the difficulties in measuring bond energies both for the substrates and intermediates, this is definitely a very important issue that should be more generally contemplated. To this end, this review is rooted in the energetic aspects of C-H activation\/functionalization, which were previously rarely discussed in detail. Starting with a concise but necessary introduction of various classical methods for measuring heterolytic and homolytic energies for C-H bonds, the present review provides examples that applied the concept and values of C-H bond energy in rationalizing the observations associated with reactivity and\/or selectivity in C-H activation\/functionalization.","1335":null,"1336":"In the wide area of host-guest chemistry, hemicryptophanes, combining a cyclotribenzylene (or cyclotriveratrylene CTV) unit with another different C3-symmetrical moiety, appears as a recent family of molecular cages. The synthesis and recognition properties of the first hemicryptophane were reported in 1982 by Collet and Lehn, but the very little attention received by this class of host compounds in the 20 years following this first promising result can account for their apparent novelty. Indeed, in the last 10 years hemicryptophanes have aroused growing interest, and new aspects have been developed. Thanks to the rigid shaping unit of the north part (CTV) and also the variable and easily functionalized south moiety, hemicryptophanes are revealed to be inherently chiral ditopic host compounds, able to encapsulate various guests, including charged and neutral species. They also enter the field of stimuli-responsive supramolecular systems exhibiting controlled functions. Moreover, endohedral functionalization of their inner cavity leads to supramolecular catalysts. The confinement of the catalytic center affords nanoreactors with improved catalytic activities or selectivities when compared to model systems without a cavity. The current trend shows that reactions in the confined space of synthetic hosts, mimicking enzyme behavior, will expand rapidly in the near future.","1337":"Noncovalent van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion forces are ubiquitous in nature and influence the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of molecules and materials throughout chemistry, biology, physics, and materials science. These forces are quantum mechanical in origin and arise from electrostatic interactions between fluctuations in the electronic charge density. Here, we explore the conceptual and mathematical ingredients required for an exact treatment of vdW interactions, and present a systematic and unified framework for classifying the current first-principles vdW methods based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem (namely the Rutgers-Chalmers vdW-DF, Vydrov-Van Voorhis (VV), exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM), Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS), many-body dispersion (MBD), and random-phase approximation (RPA) approaches). Particular attention is paid to the intriguing nature of many-body vdW interactions, whose fundamental relevance has recently been highlighted in several landmark experiments. The performance of these models in predicting binding energetics as well as structural, electronic, and thermodynamic properties is connected with the theoretical concepts and provides a numerical summary of the state-of-the-art in the field. We conclude with a roadmap of the conceptual, methodological, practical, and numerical challenges that remain in obtaining a universally applicable and truly predictive vdW method for realistic molecular systems and materials.","1338":"Core-shell nanoparticles are at the leading edge of the hot research topics and offer a wide range of applications in optics, biomedicine, environmental science, materials, catalysis, energy, and so forth, due to their excellent properties such as versatility, tunability, and stability. They have attracted enormous interest attributed to their dramatically tunable physicochemical features. Plasmonic core-shell nanomaterials are extensively used in surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies, in particular, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), due to the unique localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property. This review provides a comprehensive overview of core-shell nanoparticles in the context of fundamental and application aspects of SERS and discusses numerous classes of core-shell nanoparticles with their unique strategies and functions. Further, herein we also introduce the concept of shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) in detail because it overcomes the long-standing limitations of material and morphology generality encountered in traditional SERS. We then explain the SERS-enhancement mechanism with core-shell nanoparticles, as well as three generations of SERS hotspots for surface analysis of materials. To provide a clear view for readers, we summarize various approaches for the synthesis of core-shell nanoparticles and their applications in SERS, such as electrochemistry, bioanalysis, food safety, environmental safety, cultural heritage, materials, catalysis, and energy storage and conversion. Finally, we exemplify about the future developments in new core-shell nanomaterials with different functionalities for SERS and other surface-enhanced spectroscopies.","1339":"The rapidly expanding field of nonaqueous multivalent intercalation batteries offers a promising way to overcome safety, cost, and energy density limitations of state-of-the-art Li-ion battery technology.

The present analysis covers a wide variety of material chemistries, including chalcogenides, oxides, and polyanions, highlighting merits and challenges of each class of materials as multivalent cathodes. The review underscores the overlap of experiments and theory, ranging from charting the design metrics useful for developing the next generation of MV-cathodes to targeted in-depth studies rationalizing complex experimental results. On the basis of our critical review of the literature, we provide suggestions for future multivalent cathode studies, including a strong emphasis on the unambiguous characterization of the intercalation mechanisms.","1340":"C-H bond activation and decarboxylation are two significant processes in organic synthesis. The combination of these processes provides a novel synthetic strategy, that is, decarboxylative C-H bond functionalization. Considerable attention has been focused on such an active research field. This review offers an overview of the utility of decarboxylative C-H bond functionalization in the synthesis of various organic compounds, such as styrenes, chalcones, biaryls, and heterocycles, covering most of the recent advances of the decarboxylative functionalization of Csp-H, Csp2-H, and Csp3-H bonds, as well as their scopes, limitations, practical applications, and synthetic potentials.","1341":"Despite its short history, diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy techniques have already made a substantial imprint in the biological sciences. In this review, we describe how stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging originally evolved, how it compares to other optical super-resolution imaging techniques, and what advantages it provides compared to previous golden-standards for biological microscopy, such as diffraction-limited optical microscopy and electron microscopy. We outline the prerequisites for successful STED imaging experiments, emphasizing the equally critical roles of instrumentation, sample preparation, and photophysics, and describe major evolving strategies for how to push the borders of STED imaging even further in life science. Finally, we provide examples of how STED nanoscopy can be applied, within three different fields with particular potential for STED imaging experiments: neuroscience, plasma membrane biophysics, and subcellular clinical diagnostics. In these areas, and in many more, STED imaging can be expected to play an increasingly important role in the future.","1342":"A fundamental understanding of polymer microstructure is important in order to design novel polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) with excellent electrochemical performance and stabilities. Hydrocarbon-based polymers have distinct microstructure according to their chemical structure. The ionic clusters and\/or channels play a critical role in PEMs, affecting ion conductivity and water transport, especially at medium temperature and low relative humidity (RH). In addition, physical properties such as water uptake and dimensional swelling behavior depend strongly on polymer morphology. Over the past few decades, much research has focused on the synthetic development and microstructural characterization of hydrocarbon-based PEM materials. Furthermore, blends, composites, pressing, shear field, electrical field, surface modification, and cross-linking have also been shown to be effective approaches to obtain\/maintain well-defined PEM microstructure. This review summarizes recent work on developments in advanced PEMs with various chemical structures and architecture and the resulting polymer microstructures and morphologies that arise for potential application in fuel cell, lithium ion battery, redox flow battery, actuators, and electrodialysis.","1343":"With advances in sequencing technology, uncharacterized proteins and domains of unknown function (DUFs) are rapidly accumulating in sequence databases and offer an opportunity to discover new protein chemistry and reaction mechanisms. The focus of this review, the formerly enigmatic YcaO superfamily (DUF181), has been found to catalyze a unique phosphorylation of a ribosomal peptide backbone amide upon attack by different nucleophiles. Established nucleophiles are the side chains of Cys, Ser, and Thr which gives rise to azoline\/azole biosynthesis in ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products. However, much remains unknown about the potential for YcaO proteins to collaborate with other nucleophiles. Recent work suggests potential in forming thioamides, macroamidines, and possibly additional post-translational modifications. This review covers all knowledge through mid-2016 regarding the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), natural products, functions, mechanisms, and applications of YcaO proteins and outlines likely future research directions for this protein superfamily.","1344":"Microbial contamination arising from pathogens poses serious threats to human health and in recent decades has presented an unprecedented challenge to antibacterial research. Of the various antibacterial agents that effectively kill pathogens, halogen-based antibacterial compounds have been successful in eliminating harmful pathogen-associated diseases and are becoming the most popular disinfectants. As a significant subcategory of halogen antibacterial agents, N-halamines have drawn increasing research interest into their chemistry and practical applications. N-Halamines have many advantages over other antibacterial agents, including effectiveness against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, long-term physicochemical stability, high structural durability, and the regenerability of their functional groups, with corresponding renewal of their antibacterial properties. This review examines recent progress and research trends in both theoretical and experimental studies of N-halamines, with the aim of providing a systematic and comprehensive survey and assessment of the significant advances in our understanding of antibacterial N-halamines. This review serves as a practical guide to developing N-halamines through both broad and in-depth basic research and offers suggestions for their potential future applications.","1345":"The structure and function of biomolecules are strongly influenced by their hydration shells. Structural fluctuations and molecular excitations of hydrating water molecules cover a broad range in space and time, from individual water molecules to larger pools and from femtosecond to microsecond time scales. Recent progress in theory and molecular dynamics simulations as well as in ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy has led to new and detailed insight into fluctuations of water structure, elementary water motions, electric fields at hydrated biointerfaces, and processes of vibrational relaxation and energy dissipation. Here, we review recent advances in both theory and experiment, focusing on hydrated DNA, proteins, and phospholipids, and compare dynamics in the hydration shells to bulk water.","1346":"The synthesis of lanthanide-activated phosphors is pertinent to many emerging applications, ranging from high-resolution luminescence imaging to next-generation volumetric full-color display. In particular, the optical processes governed by the 4f-5d transitions of divalent and trivalent lanthanides have been the key to enabling precisely tuned color emission. The fundamental importance of lanthanide-activated phosphors for the physical and biomedical sciences has led to rapid development of novel synthetic methodologies and relevant tools that allow for probing the dynamics of energy transfer processes. Here, we review recent progress in developing methods for preparing lanthanide-activated phosphors, especially those featuring 4f-5d optical transitions. Particular attention will be devoted to two widely studied dopants, Ce3+ and Eu2+. The nature of the 4f-5d transition is examined by combining phenomenological theories with quantum mechanical calculations. An emphasis is placed on the correlation of host crystal structures with the 5d-4f luminescence characteristics of lanthanides, including quantum yield, emission color, decay rate, and thermal quenching behavior. Several parameters, namely Debye temperature and dielectric constant of the host crystal, geometrical structure of coordination polyhedron around the luminescent center, and the accurate energies of 4f and 5d levels, as well as the position of 4f and 5d levels relative to the valence and conduction bands of the hosts, are addressed as basic criteria for high-throughput computational design of lanthanide-activated phosphors.","1347":"Ionic liquids have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years, illustrated by their applications in a variety of areas involved with chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering. Usually, the stabilities of ionic liquids are highlighted as one of their outstanding advantages. However, are ionic liquids really stable in all cases? This review covers the chemical stabilities of ionic liquids. It focuses on the reactivity of the most popular imidazolium ionic liquids at structural positions, including C2 position, N1 and N3 positions, and C4 and C5 positions, and decomposition on the imidazolium ring. Additionally, we discuss decomposition of quaternary ammonium and phosphonium ionic liquids and hydrolysis and nucleophilic reactions of anions of ionic liquids. The review aims to arouse caution on potential decomposition of ionic liquids and provides a guide for better utilization of ionic liquids.","1348":"Flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) of azides is an extremely valuable method of generating nitrenes and studying their thermal rearrangements. The nitrenes can in many cases be isolated in low-temperature matrices and observed spectroscopically. NH and methyl, alkyl, aralkyl, vinyl, cyano, aryl and N-heteroaryl, acyl, carbamoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, imidoyl, boryl, silyl, phosphonyl, and sulfonyl nitrenes are included. FVP of triazoloazines generates diazomethylazines and azinylcarbenes, which often rearrange to the energetically more stable arylnitrenes. N2 elimination from monocyclic 1,2,3-triazoles can generate iminocarbenes, 1H-azirines, ketenimines, and cyclization products, and 1,2,4-triazoles are precursors of nitrile ylides. Benzotriazoles are preparatively useful precursors of cyanocyclopentadienes, carbazoles, and aza-analogues. FVP of 5-aryltetrazoles can result in double N2 elimination with formation of arylcarbenes or of heteroarylcarbenes, which again rearrange to arylnitrenes. Many 5-substituted and 2,5-disubstituted tetrazoles are excellent precursors of nitrile imines (propargylic, allenic, or carbenic), which are isolable at low temperatures in some cases (e.g., aryl- and silylnitrile imines) or rearrange to carbodiimides. 1,5-Disubstituted tetrazoles are precursors of imidoylnitrenes, which also rearrange to carbodiimides or add intramolecularly to aryl substituents to yield indazoles and related compounds. Where relevant for the mechanistic understanding, pyrolysis under flow conditions or in solution or the solid state will be mentioned. Results of photolysis reactions and computational chemistry complementing the FVP results will also be mentioned in several places.","1349":"Antibiotic resistance is a significant emerging health threat. Exacerbating this problem is the overprescription of antibiotics as well as a lack of development of new antibacterial agents. A paradigm shift toward the development of nonantibiotic agents that target the virulence factors of bacterial pathogens is one way to begin to address the issue of resistance. Of particular interest are compounds targeting bacterial AB toxins that have the potential to protect against toxin-induced pathology without harming healthy commensal microbial flora. Development of successful antitoxin agents would likely decrease the use of antibiotics, thereby reducing selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance mutations. In addition, antitoxin agents are not only promising for therapeutic applications, but also can be used as tools for the continued study of bacterial pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the growing number of examples of chemical entities designed to target exotoxin virulence factors from important human bacterial pathogens.","1350":"Ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl's) are conjugated to target proteins or lipids to regulate their activity, stability, subcellular localization, or macromolecular interactions. Similar to ubiquitin, conjugation is achieved through a cascade of activities that are catalyzed by E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes, and E3 ligases. In this review, we will summarize structural and mechanistic details of enzymes and protein cofactors that participate in Ubl conjugation cascades. Precisely, we will focus on conjugation machinery in the SUMO, NEDD8, ATG8, ATG12, URM1, UFM1, FAT10, and ISG15 pathways while referring to the ubiquitin pathway to highlight common or contrasting themes. We will also review various strategies used to trap intermediates during Ubl activation and conjugation.","1351":"Inserting molecular monolayers within metal\/semiconductor interfaces provides one of the most powerful expressions of how minute chemical modifications can affect electronic devices. This topic also has direct importance for technology as it can help improve the efficiency of a variety of electronic devices such as solar cells, LEDs, sensors, and possible future bioelectronic ones. The review covers the main aspects of using chemistry to control the various aspects of interface electrostatics, such as passivation of interface states and alignment of energy levels by intrinsic molecular polarization, as well as charge rearrangement with the adjacent metal and semiconducting contacts. One of the greatest merits of molecular monolayers is their capability to form excellent thin dielectrics, yielding rich and unique current-voltage characteristics for transport across metal\/molecular monolayer\/semiconductor interfaces. We explain the interplay between the monolayer as tunneling barrier on the one hand, and the electrostatic barrier within the semiconductor, due to its space-charge region, on the other hand, as well as how different monolayer chemistries control each of these barriers. Practical tools to experimentally identify these two barriers and distinguish between them are given, followed by a short look to the future. This review is accompanied by another one, concerning the formation of large-area molecular junctions and charge transport that is dominated solely by molecules.","1352":"","1353":"This review underscores the conformational flexibility of porphyrinoids, a unique class of functional molecules, starting from the smallest triphyrins(1.1.1) via [18]porphyrins(1.1.1.1) and concluding with a variety of expanded porphyrinoids and heteroporphyrinoids, including the enormous [96]tetracosaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0.1.0). The specific flexibility of porphyrinoids has been documented as instrumental in the designing or redesigning of macrocyclic frames, particularly in the search for adjustable platforms for coordination or organometallic chemistry, anion binding, or mechanistic switches in molecular devices. A structural prearrangement to coordinate one or more metal ions has been outlined. The coverage of the topic focuses on representative examples of geometry or conformational rearrangements for each selected class of the numerous porphyrinoids accordingly categorized by the number of built-in carbo- or heterocycles.","1354":"The use of cyclic polyene perimeter-model approaches, such as Gouterman's four-orbital model and Michl's perimeter model, to analyze trends in the electronic structures and optical properties of expanded, contracted, and isomeric porphyrins is described with an emphasis on the use of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy to validate the results of TD-DFT calculations. Trends in the electronic structures and optical properties of isomeric porphyrins are examined by comparing the properties of porphycenes, corrphycenes, hemiporphycenes, isoporphycenes, N-confused and neoconfused porphyrins, and norroles, whereas those of ring-contracted porphyrins are examined by comparing the properties of subporphyrins, triphyrins, and vacataporphyrins. The ring-expanded compounds that are examined include cyclo[n]pyrroles, [22]pentaphyrins(1.1.1.1.1), sapphyrins, smaragdyrins, isosmaragdyrins, orangarins, ozaphyrins, [26]hexaphyrins(1.1.1.1.1.1), rubyrins, rosarins, amethyrins, isoamethyrins, bronzaphyrins, and doubly N-confused hexaphyrins.","1355":"Porphyrins and related macrocycles have been intensively exploited as sensing materials in chemical sensors, since in these devices they mimic most of their biological functions, such as reversible binding, catalytic activation, and optical changes. Such a magnificent bouquet of properties allows applying porphyrin derivatives to different transducers, ranging from nanogravimetric to optical devices, also enabling the realization of multifunctional chemical sensors, in which multiple transduction mechanisms are applied to the same sensing layer. Potential applications are further expanded through sensor arrays, where cross-selective sensing layers can be applied for the analysis of complex chemical matrices. The possibility of finely tuning the macrocycle properties by synthetic modification of the different components of the porphyrin ring, such as peripheral substituents, molecular skeleton, coordinated metal, allows creating a vast library of porphyrinoid-based sensing layers. From among these, one can select optimal arrays for a particular application. This feature is particularly suitable for sensor array applications, where cross-selective receptors are required. This Review briefly describes chemical sensor principles. The main part of the Review is divided into two sections, describing the porphyrin-based devices devoted to the detection of gaseous or liquid samples, according to the corresponding transduction mechanism. Although most devices are based on porphyrin derivatives, seminal examples of the application of corroles or other porphyrin analogues are evidenced in dedicated sections.","1356":"Chemical modification at the periphery with nitrogen or chalcogens is a highly promising strategy to diversify the optical, electrochemical, magnetic, and coordination properties of the porphyrin family. Indeed, various kinds of phthalocyanines and related benzo-annelated azaporphyrinoids have been synthesized, and their fundamental properties have been extensively investigated. However, the synthesis of heteroatom-containing porphyrins in which the peripheral methine groups are partially replaced with nitrogen or chalcogens remains a considerable challenge. In this review, we will focus mainly on recent advances in the synthesis of aza-, oxa-, and thiaorphyrins and related compounds, including historically important examples.","1357":null,"1358":"Globally increasing energy demands and environmental concerns related to the use of fossil fuels have stimulated extensive research to identify new energy systems and economies that are sustainable, clean, low cost, and environmentally benign. Hydrogen generation from solar-driven water splitting is a promising strategy to store solar energy in chemical bonds. The subsequent combustion of hydrogen in fuel cells produces electric energy, and the only exhaust is water. These two reactions compose an ideal process to provide clean and sustainable energy. In such a process, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during water splitting, and an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a fuel cell cathodic reaction are key steps that affect the efficiency of the overall energy conversion. Catalysts play key roles in this process by improving the kinetics of these reactions. Porphyrin-based and corrole-based systems are versatile and can efficiently catalyze the ORR, OER, and HER. Because of the significance of energy-related small molecule activation, this review covers recent progress in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions catalyzed by porphyrins and corroles.","1359":"Although the biological functions of cell and tissue can be regulated by biochemical factors (e.g., growth factors, hormones), the biophysical effects of materials on the regulation of biological activity are receiving more attention. In this Review, we systematically summarize the recent progress on how biomaterials with controllable properties (e.g., compositional\/degradable dynamics, mechanical properties, 2D topography, and 3D geometry) can regulate cell behaviors (e.g., cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, cell alignment, and the differentiation or self-maintenance of stem cells) and tissue\/organ functions. How the biophysical features of materials influence tissue\/organ regeneration have been elucidated. Current challenges and a perspective on the development of novel materials that can modulate specific biological functions are discussed. The interdependent relationship between biomaterials and biology leads us to propose the concept of \"materiobiology\", which is a scientific discipline that studies the biological effects of the properties of biomaterials on biological functions at cell, tissue, organ, and the whole organism levels. This Review highlights that it is more important to develop ECM-mimicking biomaterials having a self-regenerative capacity to stimulate tissue regeneration, instead of attempting to recreate the complexity of living tissues or tissue constructs ex vivo. The principles of materiobiology may benefit the development of novel biomaterials providing combinative bioactive cues to activate the migration of stem cells from endogenous reservoirs (i.e., cell niches), stimulate robust and scalable self-healing mechanisms, and unlock the body's innate powers of regeneration.","1360":"","1361":"The rapidly growing applicability of metal-containing engineered nanoparticles (MENPs) has made their environmental fate, biouptake, and transformation important research topics. However, considering the relatively low concentration of MENPs and the high concentration of background metals in the environment and in organisms, tracking the fate of MENPs in environment-related scenarios remains a challenge. Intrinsic labeling of MENPs with radioactive or stable isotopes is a useful tool for the highly sensitive and selective detection of MENPs in the environment and organisms, thus enabling tracing of their transformation, uptake, distribution, and clearance. In this review, we focus on radioactive\/stable isotope labeling of MENPs for their environmental and biological tracing. We summarize the advantages of intrinsic radioactive\/stable isotopes for MENP labeling and discuss the considerations in labeling isotope selection and preparation of labeled MENPs, as well as exposure routes and detection of labeled MENPs. In addition, current practice in the use of radioactive\/stable isotope labeling of MENPs to study their environmental fate and bioaccumulation is reviewed. Future perspectives and potential applications are also discussed, including imaging techniques for radioactive- and stable-isotope-labeled MENPs, hyphenated multistable isotope tracers with speciation analysis, and isotope fractionation as a MENP tracer. It is expected that this critical review could provide the necessary background information to further advance the applications of isotope tracers to study the environmental fate and bioaccumulation of MENPs.","1362":"Tip-enhanced near-field Raman microscopy spectroscopy is a scanning probe technique that is capable of providing vibrational spectroscopic information on single nanoobjects and surfaces at (sub-) nanometer spatial resolution and high detection sensitivity. In this review, we first illustrate the physical principle of optical nanoantennas used in tip-enhanced near-field Raman microscopy and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) to efficiently couple light to Raman excitations on nanometer length scales. Although the antennas' electric near-field distributions are commonly understood to determine the spatial resolution, recent experiments showing subnanometer-resolved optical images put this understanding into question. This is because such images enter a regime in which classical electrodynamical descriptions might no longer be applicable and quantum plasmonic and atomistic effects could become relevant. After summarizing the current understanding of plasmonic phenomena at extremely short length scales, we discuss the different mechanisms contributing to the signal enhancement. In addition to the known contributions from electric-field and chemical enhancement, several new models have been proposed very recently that could provide important guidelines for the optimization of TERS experiments. We then review recent developments in the areas of antenna design, fabrication, and characterization. Finally, we briefly highlight recent applications to illustrate future directions of tip-enhanced near-field Raman microscopy and TERS.","1363":"The development of new methods for the direct functionalization of unactivated C-H bonds is ushering in a paradigm shift in the field of retrosynthetic analysis. In particular, the catalytic enantioselective functionalization of C-H bonds represents a highly atom- and step-economic approach toward the generation of structural complexity. However, as a result of their ubiquity and low reactivity, controlling both the chemo- and stereoselectivity of such processes constitutes a significant challenge. Herein we comprehensively review all asymmetric transition-metal-catalyzed methodologies that are believed to proceed via an inner-sphere-type mechanism, with an emphasis on the nature of stereochemistry generation. Our analysis serves to document the considerable and rapid progress within in the field, while also highlighting limitations of current methods.","1364":"Lipids and the membranes they form are fundamental building blocks of cellular life, and their geometry and chemical properties distinguish membranes from other cellular environments. Collective processes occurring within membranes strongly impact cellular behavior and biochemistry, and understanding these processes presents unique challenges due to the often complex and myriad interactions between membrane components. Super-resolution microscopy offers a significant gain in resolution over traditional optical microscopy, enabling the localization of individual molecules even in densely labeled samples and in cellular and tissue environments. These microscopy techniques have been used to examine the organization and dynamics of plasma membrane components, providing insight into the fundamental interactions that determine membrane functions. Here, we broadly introduce the structure and organization of the mammalian plasma membrane and review recent applications of super-resolution microscopy to the study of membranes. We then highlight some inherent challenges faced when using super-resolution microscopy to study membranes, and we discuss recent technical advancements that promise further improvements to super-resolution microscopy and its application to the plasma membrane.","1365":"Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) mediate the facile conversion of methane into methanol in methanotrophic bacteria with high efficiency under ambient conditions. Because the selective oxidation of methane is extremely challenging, there is considerable interest in understanding how these enzymes carry out this difficult chemistry. The impetus of these efforts is to learn from the microbes to develop a biomimetic catalyst to accomplish the same chemical transformation. Here, we review the progress made over the past two to three decades toward delineating the structures and functions of the catalytic sites in two MMOs: soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). sMMO is a water-soluble three-component protein complex consisting of a hydroxylase with a nonheme diiron catalytic site; pMMO is a membrane-bound metalloenzyme with a unique tricopper cluster as the site of hydroxylation. The metal cluster in each of these MMOs harnesses O2 to functionalize the C-H bond using different chemistry. We highlight some of the common basic principles that they share. Finally, the development of functional models of the catalytic sites of MMOs is described. These efforts have culminated in the first successful biomimetic catalyst capable of efficient methane oxidation without overoxidation at room temperature.","1366":"Daphniphyllum is an evergreen species known since 1826.

Consequently, ligand-free colloids are ideal reference materials for evaluating the effects of surface adsorbates from the initial state for application-oriented nanointegration purposes. After two decades of development, laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) has emerged as a convenient and scalable technique for the synthesis of ligand-free nanomaterials in sealed environments. In addition to the high-purity surface of LSPC-generated nanoparticles, other strengths of LSPC include its high throughput, convenience for preparing alloys or series of doped nanomaterials, and its continuous operation mode, suitable for downstream processing. Unscreened surface charge of LSPC-synthesized colloids is the key to achieving colloidal stability and high affinity to biomolecules as well as support materials, thereby enabling the fabrication of bioconjugates and heterogeneous catalysts. Accurate size control of LSPC-synthesized materials ranging from quantum dots to submicrometer spheres and recent upscaling advancement toward the multiple-gram scale are helpful for extending the applicability of LSPC-synthesized nanomaterials to various fields. By discussing key reports on both the fundamentals and the applications related to laser ablation, fragmentation, and melting in liquids, this Article presents a timely and critical review of this emerging topic.","1370":"Membrane proteins play a most important part in metabolism, signaling, cell motility, transport, development, and many other biochemical and biophysical processes which constitute fundamentals of life on the molecular level.

Apart of the analysis of data published to date, the significance of the speed of sound in ILs is regarded. An analysis of experimental methods described in the literature to determine the speed of sound in ILs as a function of temperature and pressure is reported, and the relevance of ultrasound absorption in acoustic investigations is discussed. Careful attention was paid to highlight possible artifacts, and side phenomena related to the absorption and relaxation present in such measurements. Then, an overview of existing data is depicted to describe the temperature and pressure dependences on the speed of sound in ILs, as well as the impact of impurities in ILs on this property. A relation between ions structure and speeds of sound is presented by highlighting existing correlation and evaluative methods described in the literature. Importantly, a critical analysis of speeds of sound in ILs vs those in classical molecular solvents is presented to compare these two classes of compounds.

We strive to provide a wide conceptual overview of three main subtopics. First, a broad introduction places NmJ in perspective to related fields of research and to single-molecule junctions (1mJ) in addition to a brief historical account. As charge transport presents an ultrasensitive probe for the electronic perfection of interfaces, in the second part ways to form both the monolayer and the contacts are described to construct reliable, defect-free interfaces. The last part is dedicated to understanding and analyses of current-voltage (I-V) traces across molecular junctions. Notwithstanding the original motivation of MolEl, I-V traces are often not very sensitive to molecular details and then provide a poor probe for chemical information. Instead, we focus on how to analyze the net electrical performance of molecular junctions, from a functional device perspective. Finally, we point to creation of a built-in electric field as a key to achieve functionality, including nonlinear current-voltage characteristics that originate in the molecules or their contacts to the electrodes.

Force is a fundamental regulatory mechanism of biomolecular interactions driving many cellular processes. The forces on a molecular scale are exactly in the range that can be manipulated and probed with single molecule force spectroscopy. The natural environment of a biomolecule is inside a living cell, hence, this is the most relevant environment for probing their function. In vivo studies are, however, challenged by the complexity of the cell. In this review, we start with presenting relevant theoretical tools for analyzing single molecule data obtained in intracellular environments followed by a description of state-of-the art visualization techniques.

This critical review offers a compilation on the main results achieved by the use of ionic-liquid-based processes in the extraction and separation\/purification of a large range of bioactive compounds (including small organic extractable compounds from biomass, lipids, and other hydrophobic compounds, proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids, and pharmaceuticals). ILs have been studied as solvents, cosolvents, cosurfactants, electrolytes, and adjuvants, as well as used in the creation of IL-supported materials for separation purposes. The IL-based processes hitherto reported, such as IL-based solid-liquid extractions, IL-based liquid-liquid extractions, IL-modified materials, and IL-based crystallization approaches, are here reviewed and compared in terms of extraction and separation performance.

These methods generally use wide-field microscopes and two-dimensional camera detectors to localize molecules to much higher precision than the diffraction limit. Given the limited total photons available from each single-molecule label, both modalities require careful mathematical analysis and image processing. Much more information can be obtained about the system under study by extending to three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule localization: without this capability, visualization of structures or motions extending in the axial direction can easily be missed or confused, compromising scientific understanding. A variety of methods for obtaining both 3D super-resolution images and 3D tracking information have been devised, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. These include imaging of multiple focal planes, point-spread-function engineering, and interferometric detection. These methods may be compared based on their ability to provide accurate and precise position information on single-molecule emitters with limited photons. To successfully apply and further develop these methods, it is essential to consider many practical concerns, including the effects of optical aberrations, field dependence in the imaging system, fluorophore labeling density, and registration between different color channels. Selected examples of 3D super-resolution imaging and tracking are described for illustration from a variety of biological contexts and with a variety of methods, demonstrating the power of 3D localization for understanding complex systems.","1379":"It is well-recognized that N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have provided a new dimension to the design of homogeneous catalysts.

Ionic liquids comprising entirely of ions provide a unique challenge in this respect due to the diverse chemical nature of available ions and the complex interplay of intermolecular interactions among them, thus resulting in the wide variability of physicochemical properties, such as thermodynamic, transport, and spectroscopic properties. It is well understood that intermolecular forces are directly linked to physicochemical properties of condensed systems, and therefore, an understanding of this relationship would greatly aid in the design and synthesis of functionalized materials with tailored properties for an application at hand. This review aims to give an overview of how electronic structure properties obtained from quantum chemical methods such as interaction\/binding energy and its fundamental components, dipole moment, polarizability, and orbital energies, can help shed light on the energetic, physical, and spectroscopic properties of semi-Coulomb systems such as ionic liquids.

Lanthipeptides that display antimicrobial activity are called lantibiotics. The post-translational modification reactions of lanthipeptides include dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, a transformation that is carried out in three unique ways in different classes of lanthipeptides. In a cyclization process, Cys residues then attack the dehydrated residues to generate the lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether cross-linked amino acids from which lanthipeptides derive their name. The resulting polycyclic peptides have constrained conformations that confer their biological activities. After installation of the characteristic thioether cross-links, tailoring enzymes introduce additional post-translational modifications that are unique to each lanthipeptide and that fine-tune their activities and\/or stability. This review focuses on studies published over the past decade that have provided much insight into the mechanisms of the enzymes that carry out the post-translational modifications.","1384":"The generation of polymer brushes by surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization (SI-CRP) techniques has become a powerful approach to tailor the chemical and physical properties of interfaces and has given rise to great advances in surface and interface engineering.

Topics reviewed stem from correlating the various physical (e.g., mechanical) and transport properties with morphology and structure across time and length scales. In addition, topics of recent interest such as structure\/transport correlations and modeling, composite PFSA membranes, degradation phenomena, and PFSA thin films are presented. Throughout, the impact of PFSA chemistry and side-chain is also discussed to present a broader perspective.","1390":null,"1391":"Naturally produced halogenated compounds are ubiquitous across all domains of life where they perform a multitude of biological functions and adopt a diversity of chemical structures. Accordingly, a diverse collection of enzyme catalysts to install and remove halogens from organic scaffolds has evolved in nature. Accounting for the different chemical properties of the four halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and the diversity and chemical reactivity of their organic substrates, enzymes performing biosynthetic and degradative halogenation chemistry utilize numerous mechanistic strategies involving oxidation, reduction, and substitution. Biosynthetic halogenation reactions range from simple aromatic substitutions to stereoselective C-H functionalizations on remote carbon centers and can initiate the formation of simple to complex ring structures. Dehalogenating enzymes, on the other hand, are best known for removing halogen atoms from man-made organohalogens, yet also function naturally, albeit rarely, in metabolic pathways. This review details the scope and mechanism of nature's halogenation and dehalogenation enzymatic strategies, highlights gaps in our understanding, and posits where new advances in the field might arise in the near future.","1392":null,"1393":"The nitrosocarbonyls (R-CONO) are highly reactive species and remarkable intermediates toward different synthetic targets. This review will cover a research area whose impact in current organic synthesis is constantly increasing in the chemical community. This review represents the first and comprehensive picture on the generation and trapping of nitrosocarbonyls and is solidly built on more than 380 papers. Six different classes of key starting materials such as hydroxamic acids, N-hydroxy carbamates, N-hydroxyureas, nitrile oxides, and 1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxides were highlighted. The content of the review surveys all the methods to generate the nitrosocarbonyls through different approaches (oxidative, thermal, photochemical, catalytic, aerobic, and the less common ones) in the light of efficiency, yields, and mildness. The most successful trapping agents employed to catch these fleeting intermediates are reviewed, exploiting their superior dienophilic, enophilic, and electrophilic power. The work is completed by paragraphs dedicated to the detection of the intermediates, theoretical studies, and insights about the challenges and future directions for the field.","1394":"A longstanding research goal has been to understand the nature and role of copper-oxygen intermediates within copper-containing enzymes and abiological catalysts. Synthetic chemistry has played a pivotal role in highlighting the viability of proposed intermediates and expanding the library of known copper-oxygen cores. In addition to the number of new complexes that have been synthesized since the previous reviews on this topic in this journal (Mirica, L. M.; Ottenwaelder, X.; Stack, T. D. P. Chem. Rev. 2004, 104, 1013-1046 and Lewis, E. A.; Tolman, W. B. Chem. Rev. 2004, 104, 1047-1076), the field has seen significant expansion in the (1) range of cores synthesized and characterized, (2) amount of mechanistic work performed, particularly in the area of organic substrate oxidation, and (3) use of computational methods for both the corroboration and prediction of proposed intermediates. The scope of this review has been limited to well-characterized examples of copper-oxygen species but seeks to provide a thorough picture of the spectroscopic characteristics and reactivity trends of the copper-oxygen cores discussed.","1395":"This review aims at giving the readers the basic concepts needed to understand two-dimensional bimolecular organizations at the vacuum-solid interface. The first part describes and analyzes molecules-molecules and molecules-substrates interactions. The current limitations and needs in the understanding of these forces are also detailed. Then, a critical analysis of the past and recent advances in the field is presented by discussing most of the key papers describing bicomponents self-assembly on solid surface in an ultrahigh vacuum environment. These sections are organized by considering decreasing molecule-molecule interaction strengths (i.e. starting from strong directional multiple H bonds up to weaker nondirectional bonds taking into account the increasing fundamental role played by the surface). Finally, we conclude with some research directions (predicting self-assembly, multi-components systems, and nonmetallic surfaces) and potential applications (porous networks and organic surfaces).","1396":"Climate change, global warming, urban air pollution, energy supply uncertainty and depletion, and rising costs of conventional energy sources are, among others, potential socioeconomic threats that our community faces today. Transportation is one of the primary sectors contributing to oil consumption and global warming, and natural gas (NG) is considered to be a relatively clean transportation fuel that can significantly improve local air quality, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and decrease the energy dependency on oil sources. Internal combustion engines (ignited or compression) require only slight modifications for use with natural gas; rather, the main problem is the relatively short driving distance of natural-gas-powered vehicles due to the lack of an appropriate storage method for the gas, which has a low energy density. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has set some targets for NG storage capacity to obtain a reasonable driving range in automotive applications, ruling out the option of storing methane at cryogenic temperatures. In recent years, both academia and industry have foreseen the storage of natural gas by adsorption (ANG) in porous materials, at relatively low pressures and ambient temperatures, as a solution to this difficult problem. This review presents recent developments in the search for novel porous materials with high methane storage capacities. Within this scenario, both carbon-based materials and metal-organic frameworks are considered to be the most promising materials for natural gas storage, as they exhibit properties such as large surface areas and micropore volumes, that favor a high adsorption capacity for natural gas. Recent advancements, technological issues, advantages, and drawbacks involved in natural gas storage in these two classes of materials are also summarized. Further, an overview of the recent developments and technical challenges in storing natural gas as hydrates in wetted porous carbon materials is also included. Finally, an analysis of design factors and technical issues that need to be considered before adapting vehicles to ANG technology is also presented.","1397":"Photocatalysis has been invariably considered as an unselective process (especially in water) for a fairly long period of time, and the investigation on selective photocatalysis has been largely neglected. In recent years, the field of selective photocatalysis is developing rapidly and now extended to several newer applications. This review focuses on the overall strategies which can improve the selectivity of photocatalysis encompassing a wide variety of photocatalysts, and modifications thereof, as well as the related vital processes of industrial significance such as reduction and oxidation of organics, inorganics, and CO2 transformation. Comprehensive and successful strategies for enhancing the selectivity in photocatalysis are abridged to reinvigorate and stimulate future investigations. In addition, nonsemiconductor type photocatalysts, such as Ti-Si molecular sieves and carbon quantum dots (CQDs), are also briefly appraised in view of their special role in special selective photocatalysis, namely epoxidation reactions, among others. In the end, a summary and outlook on the challenges and future directions in the research field are included in the comprehensive review.","1398":null,"1399":"Over the course of the past 15 years the success story of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) compounds in organic, inorganic, and organometallic chemistry has been extended to another dimension. The immobilization of NHC compounds, undergoing continuous diversification, broadens their range of applications and leads to new solutions for challenges in catalytic and synthetic chemistry. This review intends to present a synthetic toolkit for the immobilization of NHC compounds, giving the reader an overview on synthetic techniques and strategies available in the literature. By individually summarizing and assessing the synthetic steps of the immobilization process, a comprehensive picture of the strategies and methodologies for the immobilization of NHC compounds is presented. Furthermore, the characterization of supported NHC compounds is discussed in detail in order to set up necessary criteria for an in-depth analysis of the immobilized derivatives. Finally, the catalytic applications of immobilized NHC compounds are briefly reviewed to illustrate the practical use of this technique for a broad variety of reaction types.","1400":"Cyclic monomers bearing either vinyl or exomethylene groups have the ability to be polymerized through a radical pathway via a ring-opening mechanism (addition-fragmentation process), leading to the introduction of functionalities in the polymer backbone. Radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP) combines the advantages of both ring-opening polymerization and radical polymerization, that is the preparation of polymers bearing heteroatoms in the backbone but with the ease and robustness of a radical process. This current review presents a comprehensive description of rROP by detailing: (i) the various monomers that polymerize through rROP; (ii) the main parameters that govern the rROP mechanism; (iii) the copolymerization by conventional or controlled\/living radical polymerization between rROP monomers and traditional vinyl monomers to obtain copolymers with advanced properties; (iv) the different applications (low shrinkage materials and preparation of (bio)degradable materials) of rROP monomer-containing materials, and (v) the main alternatives to rROP to induce degradability to materials obtained by a radical polymerization.","1401":null,"1402":"This review describes the growing partnership between super-resolution imaging and plasmonics, by describing the various ways in which the two topics mutually benefit one another to enhance our understanding of the nanoscale world. First, localization-based super-resolution imaging strategies, where molecules are modulated between emissive and nonemissive states and their emission localized, are applied to plasmonic nanoparticle substrates, revealing the hidden shape of the nanoparticles while also mapping local electromagnetic field enhancements and reactivity patterns on their surface. However, these results must be interpreted carefully due to localization errors induced by the interaction between metallic substrates and single fluorophores. Second, plasmonic nanoparticles are explored as image contrast agents for both superlocalization and super-resolution imaging, offering benefits such as high photostability, large signal-to-noise, and distance-dependent spectral features but presenting challenges for localizing individual nanoparticles within a diffraction-limited spot. Finally, the use of plasmon-tailored excitation fields to achieve subdiffraction-limited spatial resolution is discussed, using localized surface plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons to create confined excitation volumes or image magnification to enhance spatial resolution.","1403":"Functional graphene nanomaterials (FGNs) are fast emerging materials with extremely unique physical and chemical properties and physiological ability to interfere and\/or interact with bioorganisms; as a result, FGNs present manifold possibilities for diverse biological applications. Beyond their use in drug\/gene delivery, phototherapy, and bioimaging, recent studies have revealed that FGNs can significantly promote interfacial biointeractions, in particular, with proteins, mammalian cells\/stem cells, and microbials. FGNs can adsorb and concentrate nutrition factors including proteins from physiological media. This accelerates the formation of extracellular matrix, which eventually promotes cell colonization by providing a more beneficial microenvironment for cell adhesion and growth. Furthermore, FGNs can also interact with cocultured cells by physical or chemical stimulation, which significantly mediate their cellular signaling and biological performance. In this review, we elucidate FGNs-bioorganism interactions and summarize recent advancements on designing FGN-based two-dimensional and three-dimensional architectures as multifunctional biological platforms. We have also discussed the representative biological applications regarding these FGN-based bioactive architectures. Furthermore, the future perspectives and emerging challenges will also be highlighted. Due to the lack of comprehensive reviews in this emerging field, this review may catch great interest and inspire many new opportunities across a broad range of disciplines.","1404":null,"1405":"","1406":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to many fundamental cellular signaling pathways. They transduce signals from the outside to the inside of cells in physiological processes ranging from vision to immune response. It is extremely challenging to look at them individually using conventional experimental techniques. Recently, a pseudo atomistic molecular model has emerged as a valuable tool to access information on GPCRs, more specifically on their interactions with their environment in their native cell membrane and the consequences on their supramolecular organization. This approach uses the Martini coarse grain (CG) model to describe the receptors, lipids, and solvent in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and in enough detail to allow conserving the chemical specificity of the different molecules. The elimination of unnecessary degrees of freedom has opened up large-scale simulations of the lipid-mediated supramolecular organization of GPCRs. Here, after introducing the Martini CGMD method, we review these studies carried out on various members of the GPCR family, including rhodopsin (visual receptor), opioid receptors, adrenergic receptors, adenosine receptors, dopamine receptor, and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor. These studies have brought to light an interesting set of novel biophysical principles. The insights range from revealing localized and heterogeneous deformations of the membrane bilayer at the surface of the protein, specific interactions of lipid molecules with individual GPCRs, to the effect of the membrane matrix on global GPCR self-assembly. The review ends with an overview of the lessons learned from the use of the CGMD method, the biophysical-chemical findings on lipid-protein interplay.","1407":"Photosynthesis begins when a network of pigment-protein complexes captures solar energy and transports it to the reaction center, where charge separation occurs. When necessary (under low light conditions), photosynthetic organisms perform this energy transport and charge separation with near unity quantum efficiency. Remarkably, this high efficiency is maintained under physiological conditions, which include thermal fluctuations of the pigment-protein complexes and changing local environments. These conditions introduce multiple types of heterogeneity in the pigment-protein complexes, including structural heterogeneity, energetic heterogeneity, and functional heterogeneity. Understanding how photosynthetic light-harvesting functions in the face of these fluctuations requires understanding this heterogeneity, which, in turn, requires characterization of individual pigment-protein complexes. Single-molecule spectroscopy has the power to probe individual complexes. In this review, we present an overview of the common techniques for single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy applied to photosynthetic systems and describe selected experiments on these systems. We discuss how these experiments provide a new understanding of the impact of heterogeneity on light harvesting and thus how these systems are optimized to capture sunlight under physiological conditions.","1408":"Transition-metal-catalyzed activation of C-H and C-C bonds is a challenging area in synthetic organic chemistry. Among various methods to accomplish these processes, the approach using metal-organic cooperative catalytic systems is one of the most promising. In this protocol, organic molecules as well as transition metals act as catalysts to bring about reactions, which proceed with high efficiencies and selectivities. Various metal-organic cooperative catalytic systems developed for C-H and C-C bond activation reactions are discussed in this review. Also discussed are how each metal-organic cooperative catalyst affects the reaction mechanism and what kinds of substrates can be applied in each of the catalytic processes.","1409":"Proteins exhibit structural fluctuations over decades of time scales. From the picosecond side chain motions to aggregates that form over the course of minutes, characterizing protein structure over these vast lengths of time is important to understanding their function. In the past 15 years, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) has been established as a versatile tool that can uniquely probe proteins structures on many time scales. In this review, we present some of the basic principles behind 2D IR and show how they have, and can, impact the field of protein biophysics. We highlight experiments in which 2D IR spectroscopy has provided structural and dynamical data that would be difficult to obtain with more standard structural biology techniques. We also highlight technological developments in 2D IR that continue to expand the scope of scientific problems that can be accessed in the biomedical sciences.","1410":"Aminoacyl-tRNAs were long thought to be involved solely in ribosome-dependent protein synthesis and essential primary metabolism processes, such as targeted protein degradation and peptidoglycan synthesis. About 10 years ago, an aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic valanimycin was discovered in a Streptomyces strain. Far from being an isolated case, this discovery has been followed by the description of an increasing number of aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. This review describes the three groups of aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent enzymes involved in the synthesis of natural products. Each group is characterized by a particular chemical reaction, and its members are predicted to share a specific fold. The three groups are cyclodipeptide synthases involved in diketopiperazine synthesis, LanB-like dehydratases involved in the posttranslational modification of ribosomal peptides, and transferases from various biosynthesis pathways.","1411":"Catalytic transformation of ubiquitous C-H bonds into valuable C-N bonds offers an efficient synthetic approach to construct N-functionalized molecules. Over the last few decades, transition metal catalysis has been repeatedly proven to be a powerful tool for the direct conversion of cheap hydrocarbons to synthetically versatile amino-containing compounds. This Review comprehensively highlights recent advances in intra- and intermolecular C-H amination reactions utilizing late transition metal-based catalysts. Initial discovery, mechanistic study, and additional applications were categorized on the basis of the mechanistic scaffolds and types of reactions. Reactivity and selectivity of novel systems are discussed in three sections, with each being defined by a proposed working mode.","1412":"The different types of acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation (AAD) reactions are discussed, followed by the catalysts and mechanisms involved. Special emphasis is put on the common appearance in AAD of pincer ligands, of noninnocent ligands, and of outer sphere mechanisms. Early work emphasized precious metals, mainly Ru and Ir, but interest in nonprecious metal AAD catalysis is growing. Alcohol-amine combinations are discussed to the extent that net oxidation occurs by loss of H2. These reactions are of potential synthetic interest because they can lead to N heterocycles such as pyrroles and pyridines. AAD also has green chemistry credentials in that an oxidation occurs without the need for an oxidizing agent and hence without the waste formation that would result from its use.","1413":"Vibrational spectroscopy has continued use as a powerful tool to characterize ionic liquids since the literature on room temperature molten salts experienced the rapid increase in number of publications in the 1990's. In the past years, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies have provided insights on ionic interactions and the resulting liquid structure in ionic liquids. A large body of information is now available concerning vibrational spectra of ionic liquids made of many different combinations of anions and cations, but reviews on this literature are scarce. This review is an attempt at filling this gap. Some basic care needed while recording IR or Raman spectra of ionic liquids is explained. We have reviewed the conceptual basis of theoretical frameworks which have been used to interpret vibrational spectra of ionic liquids, helping the reader to distinguish the scope of application of different methods of calculation. Vibrational frequencies observed in IR and Raman spectra of ionic liquids based on different anions and cations are discussed and eventual disagreements between different sources are critically reviewed. The aim is that the reader can use this information while assigning vibrational spectra of an ionic liquid containing another particular combination of anions and cations. Different applications of IR and Raman spectroscopies are given for both pure ionic liquids and solutions. Further issues addressed in this review are the intermolecular vibrations that are more directly probed by the low-frequency range of IR and Raman spectra and the applications of vibrational spectroscopy in studying phase transitions of ionic liquids.","1414":"Metal ions play significant roles in numerous fields including chemistry, geochemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. With computational tools increasingly becoming important in chemical research, methods have emerged to effectively face the challenge of modeling metal ions in the gas, aqueous, and solid phases. Herein, we review both quantum and classical modeling strategies for metal ion-containing systems that have been developed over the past few decades. This Review focuses on classical metal ion modeling based on unpolarized models (including the nonbonded, bonded, cationic dummy atom, and combined models), polarizable models (e.g., the fluctuating charge, Drude oscillator, and the induced dipole models), the angular overlap model, and valence bond-based models. Quantum mechanical studies of metal ion-containing systems at the semiempirical, ab initio, and density functional levels of theory are reviewed as well with a particular focus on how these methods inform classical modeling efforts. Finally, conclusions and future prospects and directions are offered that will further enhance the classical modeling of metal ion-containing systems.","1415":null,"1416":"In vivo imaging, which enables us to peer deeply within living subjects, is producing tremendous opportunities both for clinical diagnostics and as a research tool. Contrast material is often required to clearly visualize the functional architecture of physiological structures. Recent advances in nanomaterials are becoming pivotal to generate the high-resolution, high-contrast images needed for accurate, precision diagnostics. Nanomaterials are playing major roles in imaging by delivering large imaging payloads, yielding improved sensitivity, multiplexing capacity, and modularity of design. Indeed, for several imaging modalities, nanomaterials are now not simply ancillary contrast entities, but are instead the original and sole source of image signal that make possible the modality's existence. We address the physicochemical makeup\/design of nanomaterials through the lens of the physical properties that produce contrast signal for the cognate imaging modality-we stratify nanomaterials on the basis of their (i) magnetic, (ii) optical, (iii) acoustic, and\/or (iv) nuclear properties. We evaluate them for their ability to provide relevant information under preclinical and clinical circumstances, their in vivo safety profiles (which are being incorporated into their chemical design), their modularity in being fused to create multimodal nanomaterials (spanning multiple different physical imaging modalities and therapeutic\/theranostic capabilities), their key properties, and critically their likelihood to be clinically translated.","1417":"Porous organic materials have garnered colossal interest with the scientific fraternity due to their excellent gas sorption performances, catalytic abilities, energy storage capacities, and other intriguing applications. This review encompasses the recent significant breakthroughs and the conventional functions and practices in the field of porous organic materials to find useful applications and imparts a comprehensive understanding of the strategic evolution of the design and synthetic approaches of porous organic materials with tunable characteristics. We present an exhaustive analysis of the design strategies with special emphasis on the topologies of crystalline and amorphous porous organic materials. In addition to elucidating the structure-function correlation and state-of-the-art applications of porous organic materials, we address the challenges and restrictions that prevent us from realizing porous organic materials with tailored structures and properties for useful applications.","1418":null,"1419":"Ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely investigated as novel solvents, electrolytes, and soft functional materials. Nevertheless, the widespread applications of ILs in most cases have been hampered by their liquid state. The confinement of ILs into nanoporous hosts is a simple but versatile strategy to overcome this problem. Nanoconfined ILs constitute a new class of composites with the intrinsic chemistries of ILs and the original functions of solid matrices. The interplay between these two components, particularly the confinement effect and the interactions between ILs and pore walls, further endows ILs with significantly distinct physicochemical properties in the restricted space compared to the corresponding bulk systems. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of nanoconfined ILs. After a brief introduction of bulk ILs, the synthetic strategies and investigation methods for nanoconfined ILs are documented. The local structure and physicochemical properties of ILs in diverse porous hosts are summarized in the next sections. The final section highlights the potential applications of nanoconfined ILs in diverse fields, including catalysis, gas capture and separation, ionogels, supercapacitors, carbonization, and lubrication. Further research directions and perspectives on this topic are also provided in the conclusion.","1420":"Acetalated dextran (Ac-DEX) is a tunable acid-labile biopolymer with facile synthesis, aptly designed for the formulation of microparticles for vaccines and immune modulation. Tunability of degradation is achieved based on the kinetics of reaction and the molecular weight of the parent dextran polymer. This tunability translated to differential rates of activation of CD8+ T cells in an in vitro ovalbumin model and illustrated that acid-labile polymer can activate CD8+ T cells at an increased rate compared to acid-insensitive polymers. In addition, Ac-DEX has been used to encapsulate small molecules, deliver nucleotides, transport inorganic molecules, formulate immune modulating therapies and vaccines, and trigger pH responsive constructs for therapy. Here we highlight the properties and results of Ac-DEX nano-\/microparticles as well as the use of the polymer in other constructs and chemistries.","1421":null,"1422":"Fostriecin and related natural products present a significant challenge for synthetic chemists due to their structural complexity and chemical sensitivity.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art progress on the design and fabrication of plasmonic solar cells and their enhancement mechanism. The working principle is first addressed in terms of the combined effects of plasmon decay, scattering, near-field enhancement, and plasmonic energy transfer, including direct hot electron transfer and resonant energy transfer. Then, we summarize recent developments for various types of plasmonic solar cells based on silicon, dye-sensitized, organic photovoltaic, and other types of solar cells, including quantum dot and perovskite variants. We also address several issues regarding the limitations of plasmonic nanostructures, including their electrical, chemical, and physical stability, charge recombination, narrowband absorption, and high cost. Next, we propose a few potentially useful approaches that can improve the performance of plasmonic cells, such as the inclusion of graphene plasmonics, plasmon-upconversion coupling, and coupling between fluorescence resonance energy transfer and plasmon resonance energy transfer. This review is concluded with remarks on future prospects for plasmonic solar cell use.","1424":"This review describes the known electrochemistry of corroles in nonaqueous media from 1980 until the present. The outline of the review is grouped according to the periodic table, proceeding from left to right, describing first monomeric free-base derivatives and then transition-metal compounds, followed by main-group corroles, before ending with a brief description of lanthanide and actinide corroles. Many similarities exist between the redox properties of metallocorroles and metalloporphyrins, but there are also many differences due, in part, to the different charges of the two conjugated macrocycles and the noninnocence of the corrole ligand in a variety of compounds. One part of this review will focus on describing redox behavior as a function of metal ion and axial ligands, while another will focus on how changes in structure of the macrocycle are associated with changes in redox behavior. It is hoped that this review will answer the majority of the readers' questions as to what has been electrochemically observed for corroles in the past while at the same time enabling the reader to utilize data in the literature to predict and \"tune\" what might be observed in future electrochemical studies of corroles that have yet to be synthesized and characterized.","1425":"Compared to porphyrin, its isomeric, expanded, and contracted analogues are less well explored. This contrast is found to be even more drastic in the case of their peripherally annulated counterparts. Nevertheless, the chemistry of annulated isomeric, expanded, and contracted porphyrins started flourishing recently with considerable efforts over the past few years, as evidenced by an increasing number of publications. While keeping the essence of porphyrins, these annulated versions exhibit quite unique properties that have no precedence in their nonannulated counterparts. An in-depth update of research carried out so far in this emerging area will be presented in this review.","1426":"Molecule-surface interactions and processes are at the heart of many technologies, including heterogeneous catalysis, organic photovoltaics, and nanoelectronics, yet they are rarely well understood at the molecular level. Given the inhomogeneous nature of surfaces, molecular properties often vary among individual surface sites, information that is lost in ensemble-averaged techniques. In order to access such site-resolved behavior, a technique must possess lateral resolution comparable to the size of surface sites under study, analytical power capable of examining chemical properties, and single-molecule sensitivity. Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), wherein light is confined and amplified at the apex of a nanoscale plasmonic probe, meets these criteria. In ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), TERS can be performed in pristine environments, allowing for molecular-resolution imaging, low-temperature operation, minimized tip and molecular degradation, and improved stability in the presence of ultrafast irradiation. The aim of this review is to give an overview of TERS experiments performed in UHV environments and to discuss how recent reports will guide future endeavors. The advances made in the field thus far demonstrate the utility of TERS as an approach to interrogate single-molecule properties, reactions, and dynamics with spatial resolution below 1 nm.","1427":"Isoprenoids constitute one of the most diverse classes of natural products. As a compound class, they are essential to basic metabolic processes including cell-wall biosynthesis, post-translational protein modifications, and signaling. In addition, isoprenoid secondary metabolites are highly valuable natural products with a wide range of biotechnological applications. The biosynthesis of their two universal building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, was thought to proceed exclusively by way of mevalonate as a key intermediate until a novel pathway involving methylerithritol phosphate (MEP) was discovered in the early 1990s. In this review, we describe the seven enzymes of the MEP pathway, along with their discoveries, three-dimensional structures, and mechanisms. The latter include examples of remarkable enzyme catalysis including an unusual cytidilation reaction and the use of iron-sulfur cluster cofactors in reductive ring opening and hydroxy-group elimination. Furthermore, isoprenoid biosynthesis shows a characteristic species distribution. A brief overview highlights the MEP pathway's potential as a selective drug target, which is absent in humans but essential to the survival of many important bacterial and apicomplexan pathogens.","1428":null,"1429":"Modification of aromaticity is regarded as one of the most interesting and important research topics in the field of physical organic chemistry. Particularly, porphyrins and their analogues (porphyrinoids) are attractive molecules for exploring various types of aromaticity because most porphyrinoids exhibit circular conjugation pathways in their macrocyclic rings with various molecular structures. Aromaticity in porphyrinoids is significantly affected by structural modification, redox chemistry, NH tautomerization, and electronic states (singlet and triplet excited states). Conversely, aromaticity significantly affects the spectroscopic properties and chemical reactivities of porphyrinoids. In this context, considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding and controlling the aromaticity and antiaromaticity of porphyrinoids. Thus, a series of porphyrinoids are in the limelight, being expected to shed light on this field because they have some advantages to demonstrate the switching of aromaticity; it is possible to control the aromaticity by lowering the temperature, adding and removing the protons of expanded porphyrins, changing the chemical environment, and switching the electronic states (triplet and singlet excited states) by photoexcitation. In this regard, this Review describes the control of aromaticity in various expanded porphyrins from the spectroscopic point of view with assistance from theoretical calculations.","1430":null,"1431":"In this paper, we review nano-Raman techniques based on aperture scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). Fundamentals of SNOM and aperture-tip-based near-field Raman spectroscopy and their applications in key technical issues, including Raman signal intensity and collection time, are introduced. Recent advances in the tip design are discussed, and applications of the aperture-SNOM-based nano-Raman technique are presented. We attempt to identify the most pressing open questions in this field. We believe that, by improving the power transmission efficiency and combining the local field enhancing technique with the tip-enhanced spectroscopy, the performance of aperture-SNOM can be significantly improved. Its nanometer-scale excitation volume and the consequent low background make the aperture-tip technique feasible for many important samples that cannot be measured by other optical nanospectroscopies.","1432":"Electrochemical reduction of halogenated organic compounds is gaining increasing attention as a strategy for the remediation of environmental pollutants. We begin this review by discussing key components (cells, electrodes, solvents, and electrolytes) in the design of a procedure for degrading a targeted pollutant, and we describe and contrast some experimental techniques used to explore and characterize the electrochemical behavior of that pollutant. Then, we describe how to probe various mechanistic features of the pertinent electrochemistry (including stepwise versus concerted carbon-halogen bond cleavage, identification of reaction intermediates, and elucidation of mechanisms). Knowing this information is vital to the successful development of a remediation procedure. Next, we outline techniques, instrumentation, and cell designs involved in scaling up a benchtop experiment to an industrial-scale system. Finally, the last and major part of this review is directed toward surveying electrochemical studies of various categories of halogenated pollutants (chlorofluorocarbons; disinfection byproducts; pesticides, fungicides, and bactericides; and flame retardants) and looking forward to future developments.","1433":null,"1434":"Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) describes a family of techniques first discovered and developed in the 1960s. Whereas the nascent history of the technique is parallel to that of laser light sources, recent advances have spurred a resurgence in its use and development that has spanned across scientific fields and spatial scales. SRS is a nonlinear technique that probes the same vibrational modes of molecules that are seen in spontaneous Raman scattering. While spontaneous Raman scattering is an incoherent technique, SRS is a coherent process, and this fact provides several advantages over conventional Raman techniques, among which are much stronger signals and the ability to time-resolve the vibrational motions. Technological improvements in pulse generation and detection strategies have allowed SRS to probe increasingly smaller volumes and shorter time scales. This has enabled SRS research to move from its original domain, of probing bulk media, to imaging biological tissues and single cells at the micro scale, and, ultimately, to characterizing samples with subdiffraction resolution at the nanoscale. In this Review, we give an overview of the history of the technique, outline its basic properties, and present historical and current uses at multiple length scales to underline the utility of SRS to the molecular sciences.","1435":"This review collects the major progress in the field of enantioselective transformations promoted by chiral silver catalysts, covering the literature since 2008, well illustrating the power of these especially mild Lewis acid catalysts to provide novel asymmetric reactions.","1436":"Nucleoside, nucleotide, and base analogs have been in the clinic for decades to treat both viral pathogens and neoplasms.

We highlight the cellular biology and clinical biology of analogs, drug resistance mechanisms, and compound specificity towards different cancer types. Furthermore, we explore analog syntheses as well as improved and scale-up syntheses.

Over the last half-century, the layer-by-layer assembly of nanoscale films has received intense and growing interest. This has been fueled by innovation in the available materials and assembly technologies, as well as the film-characterization techniques. In this Review, we explore, discuss, and detail innovation in layer-by-layer assembly in terms of past and present developments, and we highlight how these might guide future advances. A particular focus is on conventional and early developments that have only recently regained interest in the layer-by-layer assembly field. We then review unconventional assemblies and approaches that have been gaining popularity, which include inorganic\/organic hybrid materials, cells and tissues, and the use of stereocomplexation, patterning, and dip-pen lithography, to name a few. A relatively recent development is the use of layer-by-layer assembly materials and techniques to assemble films in a single continuous step. We name this \"quasi\"-layer-by-layer assembly and discuss the impacts and innovations surrounding this approach. Finally, the application of characterization methods to monitor and evaluate layer-by-layer assembly is discussed, as innovation in this area is often overlooked but is essential for development of the field. While we intend for this Review to be easily accessible and act as a guide to researchers new to layer-by-layer assembly, we also believe it will provide insight to current researchers in the field and help guide future developments and innovation.","1438":"The ruthenium-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) affords 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles in one step and complements the more established copper-catalyzed reaction providing the 1,4-isomer.

Recent progress in the preparative organic and organometallic chemistry of polypyridines has resulted in the elimination of the most serious drawbacks concerning qtpy synthesis, consequently giving rise to a renewed interest in this class of compounds.

The hydrogen atoms in these clusters can be replaced by convenient groups that open the way to a chemical alternative to conventional \"organic\" or \"organometallic\" realms. Icosahedral boron cluster derivatives have been reviewed from different perspectives; however, there is a need for a review dedicated to the redox and photophysical characteristics of easily accessible borane and carborane derivatives, which are excellent materials for a wide range of applications. This review deals with the redox properties and photoluminescence behavior of this collection of compounds, as well as their influence on the properties of materials and devices whose working principles are related to electron-transfer or electron-promotion phenomena.

After a simple introduction of apparatuses used for gas-phase cluster reactions, we focus on the reactivity of metal clusters with various polar and nonpolar molecules in the gas phase and illustrate how elementary reactions of metal clusters proceed one-step at a time under a combination of geometric and electronic reorganization. The topics discussed in this study include chemical adsorption, addition reaction, cleavage of chemical bonds, etching effect, spin effect, the harpoon mechanism, and the complementary active sites (CAS) mechanism, among others.

For example, chemical glycoproteomics technologies have enabled the identification of specific glycosylation sites and glycan structures that modulate protein function in a number of biological processes. This field is now entering a stage of logarithmic growth, during which chemical innovations combined with mass spectrometry advances could make it possible to fully characterize the human glycoproteome. In this review, we describe the important role that chemical glycoproteomics methods are playing in such efforts. We summarize developments in four key areas: enrichment of glycoproteins and glycopeptides from complex mixtures, emphasizing methods that exploit unique chemical properties of glycans or introduce unnatural functional groups through metabolic labeling and chemoenzymatic tagging; identification of sites of protein glycosylation; targeted glycoproteomics; and functional glycoproteomics, with a focus on probing interactions between glycoproteins and glycan-binding proteins. Our goal with this survey is to provide a foundation on which continued technological advancements can be made to promote further explorations of protein glycosylation.","1448":"Porphyrins, called the pigments of life, have been studied for decades. However, the first constitutional isomer of porphyrin, porphycene, was not synthesized until 1986. This milestone marked the beginning of a new era in the field of porphyrinoids and presented opportunities for the creation of an abundance of new pigments. The unique structural and electronic features of these compounds give rise to interesting physical and optical properties with applications in biomedicine and materials science. This review focuses on the synthetic methodologies available for the preparation of porphycenes (functionalized porphycenes, extended porphycenes, benzoporphycenes, naphthoporphycenes, and heteroanalogues) and the other known isomers, namely, corrphycene, hemiporphycene, and isoporphycene.

AFM-IR works by using the tip of an AFM probe to locally detect thermal expansion in a sample resulting from absorption of infrared radiation. AFM-IR thus can provide the spatial resolution of AFM in combination with the chemical analysis and compositional imaging capabilities of infrared spectroscopy. This article briefly reviews the development and underlying technology of AFM-IR, including recent advances, and then surveys a wide range of applications and investigations using AFM-IR. AFM-IR applications that will be discussed include those in polymers, life sciences, photonics, solar cells, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and cultural heritage. In the Supporting Information , the authors provide a theoretical section that reviews the physics underlying the AFM-IR measurement and detection mechanisms.","1450":"Ultrafast photochemical reactions in liquids occur on similar or shorter time scales compared to the equilibration of the optically populated excited state. This equilibration involves the relaxation of intramolecular and\/or solvent modes. As a consequence, the reaction dynamics are no longer exponential, cannot be quantified by rate constants, and may depend on the excitation wavelength contrary to slower photochemical processes occurring from equilibrated excited states. Such ultrafast photoinduced reactions do no longer obey the Kasha-Vavilov rule. Nonequilibrium effects are also observed in diffusion-controlled intermolecular processes directly after photoexcitation, and their proper description gives access to the intrinsic reaction dynamics that are normally hidden by diffusion. Here we discuss these topics in relation to ultrafast organic photochemical reactions in homogeneous liquids. Discussed reactions include intra- and intermolecular electron- and proton-transfer processes, as well as photochromic reactions occurring with and without bond breaking or bond formation, namely ring-opening reactions and cis-trans isomerizations, respectively.","1451":"The field of organic photovoltaics has developed rapidly over the last 2 decades, and small solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 13% have been demonstrated. Light absorbed in the organic layers forms tightly bound excitons that are split into free electrons and holes using heterojunctions of electron donor and acceptor materials, which are then extracted at electrodes to give useful electrical power. This review gives a concise description of the fundamental processes in photovoltaic devices, with the main emphasis on the characterization of energy transfer and its role in dictating device architecture, including multilayer planar heterojunctions, and on the factors that impact free carrier generation from dissociated excitons. We briefly discuss harvesting of triplet excitons, which now attracts substantial interest when used in conjunction with singlet fission. Finally, we introduce the techniques used by researchers for characterization and engineering of bulk heterojunctions to realize large photocurrents, and examine the formed morphology in three prototypical blends.","1452":null,"1453":"Light-driven phenomena both in living systems and nonliving materials have enabled truly fascinating and incredible dynamic architectures with terrific forms and functions.

In this Review, we focus on the developments of light-driven liquid crystalline materials containing photochromic components over the past decade. Design and synthesis of photochromic liquid crystals (LCs), photoinduced phase transitions in LC, and photoalignment and photoorientation of LCs have been covered. Photomodulation of pitch, polarization, lattice constant and handedness inversion of chiral LCs is discussed. Light-driven phenomena and properties of liquid crystalline polymers, elastomers, and networks have also been analyzed. The applications of photoinduced phase transitions, photoalignment, photomodulation of chiral LCs, and photomobile polymers have been highlighted wherever appropriate. The combination of photochromism, liquid crystallinity, and fabrication techniques has enabled some fascinating functional materials which can be driven by ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light irradiation. Nanoscale particles have been incorporated to widen and diversify the scope of the light-driven liquid crystalline materials.

Several structure types are also found in proteins. The large majority of research on these clusters has involved elucidation of physical properties. Here, we direct attention to reactivity in the form of cluster conversions in which the FemSq cores of reactants are transformed to new structures, usually of different nuclearity, in overall reactions such as self-assembly and fragment condensation and dissociation. An extensive body of core conversions, many of which have not been recognized as such, are presented including those in biological systems. All structural core types are depicted, and all core conversions are diagrammatically summarized. Clusters containing the cubane-type Fe4S4 core play a central role in conversion chemistry.

However, current state-of-the-art materials have low tolerance to sulfur, a common contaminant of many fuels, and are vulnerable to deactivation due to carbon deposition when using carbon-containing compounds. In this review, we first study the theoretical basis behind carbon and sulfur poisoning, before examining the strategies toward carbon and sulfur tolerance used so far in the SOFC literature. We then study the more extensive relevant heterogeneous catalysis literature for strategies and materials which could be incorporated into carbon and sulfur tolerant fuel cells.","1459":"The control of luminous radiation has extremely important implications for modern and future technologies as well as in medicine.

The properties of heteroporphyrins depend on the nature and number of different heterocycle(s) present in place of pyrrole ring(s). The heteroporphyrins provide unique and unprecedented coordination environments for metals. Unlike regular porphyrins, the monoheteroporphyrins are known to stabilize metals in unusual oxidation states such as Cu and Ni in +1 oxidation states. The diheteroporphyrins, which are neutral macrocycles without ionizable protons, also showed interesting coordination chemistry. Thus, significant progress has been made in last few decades on core-modified porphyrins in terms of their synthesis, their use in building multiporphyrin arrays for light-harvesting applications, their use as ligands to form interesting metal complexes, and also their use for several other studies. The synthetic methods available in the literature allow one to prepare mono- and diheteroporphyrins and their functionalized derivatives, which were used extensively to prepare several covalent and noncovalent heteroporphyrin-based multiporphyrin arrays. The methods are also developed to synthesize different hetero analogues of porphyrin derivatives such as heterocorroles, heterochlorins, heterocarbaporphyrinoids, heteroatom-substituted confused porphyrins, and so on. This Review summarizes the key developments that have occurred in heteroporphyrin chemistry over the last four decades.","1461":"Corroles have come a long way from being a curiosity to being a mainstream research topic.

To aid the investigator in developing synthetic strategies, some of the sections culminate in tables containing comparisons of various methodologies leading to meso-substituted corroles. The remaining challenges are delineated. In the second part of this review, we also describe the syntheses of isocorroles and heteroanalogs of corroles such as triazacorroles (corrolazines), 10-heterocorroles, 21-heterocorroles, 22-heterocorroles, N-confused corroles, as well as norcorroles.

Thus, they are key monomers for the synthesis of polyamides, polyureas, polyepoxydes, which are all of growing interest in automotive, aerospace, building, or health applications. Despite a growing interest for biobased monomers and polymers, and particularly polyamides, it should be noticed that very few natural amines are available. Actually, there is only chitosan and poly(lysine). In this review we present both fundamental and applied research on the synthesis of biobased primary and secondary amines with current available biobased resources. Their use is described as a building block for material chemistry. Hence, we first recall some background on the synthesis of amines, including the reactivity of amines. Second we focus on the synthesis of biobased amines from all sorts of biomass, from carbohydrate, terpenes, or oleochemical sources. Third, because they need optimization and technological developments, we discuss some examples of their use for the creation of biobased polymers. We conclude with the future of the synthesis of biobased amines and their use in different applications.","1463":"Direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP) has recently been established as an environmentally benign method for the preparation of conjugated polymers. This synthetic tool features the formation of C-C bonds between halogenated (hetero)arenes and simple (hetero)arenes with active C-H bonds, thereby circumventing the preparation of organometallic derivatives and decreasing the overall production cost of conjugated polymers. Since its inception, selectivity and reactivity of DHAP procedures have been improved tremendously through the careful scrutinity of polymerization outcomes and the fine-tuning of reaction conditions. A broad range of monomers, from simple arenes to complex functionalized heteroarenes, can now be readily polymerized. The successful application of DHAP now leads to nearly defect-free conjugated polymers possessing comparable, if not slightly better, characteristics than their counterparts prepared using classical cross-coupling methods.

We highlight the challenge of obtaining acid-stable OER catalysts, with proposals for elements that could be employed to reach this goal. We suggest that future advances in solar fuels science will be accelerated by the development of new methods for materials synthesis and characterization, along with in-depth investigations of redox mechanisms at catalytic surfaces.","1466":"Organophosphonic acids are unique as natural products in terms of stability and mimicry. The C-P bond that defines these compounds resists hydrolytic cleavage, while the phosphonyl group is a versatile mimic of transition-states, intermediates, and primary metabolites. This versatility may explain why a variety of organisms have extensively explored the use organophosphonic acids as bioactive secondary metabolites. Several of these compounds, such as fosfomycin and bialaphos, figure prominently in human health and agriculture. The enzyme reactions that create these molecules are an interesting mix of chemistry that has been adopted from primary metabolism as well as those with no chemical precedent. Additionally, the phosphonate moiety represents a source of inorganic phosphate to microorganisms that live in environments that lack this nutrient; thus, unusual enzyme reactions have also evolved to cleave the C-P bond.

Depending on the element chelated by the corrole, these theranostic agents may be tuned primarily for diagnostic or therapeutic function. Versatile synthetic methodologies allow for the preparation of amphipolar derivatives, which form stable noncovalent conjugates with targeting biomolecules. These conjugates can be engineered for imaging and targeting as well as therapeutic function within one theranostic assembly. In this review, we begin with a brief outline of corrole chemistry that has been uniquely useful in designing corrole-based anticancer agents. Then we turn attention to the early literature regarding corrole anticancer activity, which commenced one year after the first scalable synthesis was reported (1999-2000). In 2001, a major advance was made with the introduction of negatively charged corroles, as these molecules, being amphipolar, form stable conjugates with many proteins. More recently, both cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of metallocorroles have been documented in experimental investigations employing advanced optical spectroscopic as well as magnetic resonance imaging techniques. Key results from work on both cellular and animal models are reviewed, with emphasis on those that have shed new light on the mechanisms associated with anticancer activity.

Among such processes are photoisomerization, photooxidation\/photoreduction, breaking and making of covalent bonds, and excited-state proton transfer (ESPT). Many of these transformations are initiated by electron transfer (ET). The quantum yields of these processes vary significantly, from nearly 1 for ESPT to 10-4-10-6 for ET. Importantly, even when quantum yields are relatively small, at the conditions of repeated illumination the overall effect is significant. Depending on the task at hand, fluorescent protein photochemistry is regarded either as an asset facilitating new applications or as a nuisance leading to the loss of optical output. The phenomena arising due to phototransformations include (i) large Stokes shifts, (ii) photoconversions, photoactivation, and photoswitching, (iii) phototoxicity, (iv) blinking, (v) permanent bleaching, and (vi) formation of long-lived intermediates. The focus of this review is on the most recent experimental and theoretical work on photoinduced transformations in fluorescent proteins.

The interesting inherent electronic donor properties of TTFs control the overall electrochemical properties of the supramolecular structures, leading to the construction of highly efficient optoelectronic materials, photovoltaic solar cells, organic field-effect transistors, and optical sensors. Modified TTF structures thus constitute promising candidates for the development of so-called \"functional materials\" that could see use in modern technological applications.

They can serve as either a complement or an alternative to conventional, metal-based SERS, offering key advantages in terms of low invasiveness, reproducibility, versatility, and recyclability. In comparison to metals, dielectric systems and, in particular, semiconductors are characterized by a much greater variety of parameters and properties that can be tailored to achieve enhanced Raman scattering or related effects.

Selected examples of C-N cross-coupling reactions between nine classes of nitrogen-based coupling partners and (pseudo)aryl halides are described for the synthesis of heterocycles, medicinally relevant compounds, natural products, organic materials, and catalysts.","1487":"Advanced drug delivery systems (DDS) enhance treatment efficacy of different therapeutics in a dosage, spatial, and\/or temporal controlled manner. To date, numerous chemical- or physical-based stimuli-responsive formulations or devices for controlled drug release have been developed. Among them, the emerging mechanical force-based stimulus offers a convenient and robust controlled drug release platform and has attracted increasing attention. The relevant DDS can be activated to promote drug release by different types of mechanical stimuli, including compressive force, tensile force, and shear force as well as indirect formats, remotely triggered by ultrasound and magnetic field. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in mechanically activated DDS. The opportunities and challenges regarding clinical translations are also discussed.","1488":"In the past decade, the asymmetric synthesis of chiral nonracemic isoquinoline alkaloids, a family of natural products showing a wide range of structural diversity and biological and pharmaceutical activity, has been based either on continuation or improvement of known traditional methods or on new, recently developed, strategies. Both diastereoselective and enantioselective catalytic methods have been applied. This review describes the stereochemically modified traditional syntheses (the Pictet-Spengler, the Bischler-Napieralski, and the Pomeranz-Fritsch-Bobbitt) along with strategies based on closing of the nitrogen-containing ring B of the isoquinoline core by the formation of bonds between C1-N2, N2-C3, C1-N2\/N2-C3, and C1-N2\/C4-C4a atoms. Methods involving introduction of substituents at the C1 carbon of isoquinoline core along with syntheses applying various biocatalytic techniques have also been reviewed.","1489":"Biomass has been long exploited as an anthropogenic energy source; however, the 21st century challenges of energy security and climate change are driving resurgence in its utilization both as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels and as a sustainable carbon feedstock for chemicals production. Deconstruction of cellulose and hemicellulose carbohydrate polymers into their constituent C5 and C6 sugars, and subsequent heterogeneously catalyzed transformations, offer the promise of unlocking diverse oxygenates such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and gluconic acid as biorefinery platform chemicals. Here, we review recent advances in the design and development of catalysts and processes for C5-C6 sugar reforming into chemical intermediates and products, and highlight the challenges of aqueous phase operation and catalyst evaluation, in addition to process considerations such as solvent and reactor selection.","1490":"The field of nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) is already more than 30 years old, and yet continuing interest in these structures is driven by both the fascinating physics emerging from strong quantum confinement of electronic excitations, as well as a large number of prospective applications that could benefit from the tunable properties and amenability toward solution-based processing of these materials. The focus of this review is on recent advances in nanocrystal research related to applications of QD materials in lasing, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and solar energy conversion. A specific underlying theme is innovative concepts for tuning the properties of QDs beyond what is possible via traditional size manipulation, particularly through heterostructuring. Examples of such advanced control of nanocrystal functionalities include the following: interface engineering for suppressing Auger recombination in the context of QD LEDs and lasers; Stokes-shift engineering for applications in large-area luminescent solar concentrators; and control of intraband relaxation for enhanced carrier multiplication in advanced QD photovoltaics. We examine the considerable recent progress on these multiple fronts of nanocrystal research, which has resulted in the first commercialized QD technologies. These successes explain the continuing appeal of this field to a broad community of scientists and engineers, which in turn ensures even more exciting results to come from future exploration of this fascinating class of materials.

The review aims to comprehensively discuss relevant work, which was mainly done in the field in the last 20 years. Organization of the data follows a subdivision according to substrate classes: catalytic direct formation of amides from carboxylic and amines ( section 2 ); the use of carboxylic acid surrogates ( section 3 ); and the use of amine surrogates ( section 4 ). The ligation strategies (NCL, Staudinger, KAHA, KATs, etc.) that could involve both carboxylic acid and amine surrogates are treated separately in section 5 .","1493":"","1494":"Following immediately after the serendipitous discovery of N-confused porphyrins, remarkably diverse carbaporphyrinoid systems have been synthesized and investigated. By replacing a pyrrolic unit within the porphyrin framework with cyclopentadiene, indene, azulene, cycloheptatriene, or benzene, new families of porphyrin-like macrocycles were produced. True carbaporphyrins are fully aromatic structures, while benziporphyrins are essentially devoid of macrocyclic aromatic character, and azuliporphyrins fall midway between the two extremes. Monocarbaporphyrinoids are superior organometallic ligands and form stable complexes with copper(III), silver(III), gold(III), nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II), rhodium(III), iridium(III), and ruthenium(II). Unusual oxidation reactions have also been discovered, commonly leading to derivatization of the internal carbon atom. In addition, structural rearrangements have been uncovered that allow the conversion of azuliporphyrins into benzocarbaporphyrins, and benziporphyrins into carbaporphyrins. Although less well studied, many examples of dicarbaporphyrinoids have been reported, and these show equally intriguing characteristics. Furthermore, contracted and expanded carbaporphyrinoids have been investigated. Studies in this area provide fundamental insights into the aromatic properties, tautomerization, and reactivity of porphyrins and related macrocyclic systems.","1495":"This review summarizes recent progress in the design and applications of cadmium-free quantum dots (Cd-free QDs), with an emphasis on their role in biophotonics and nanomedicine. We first present the features of Cd-free QDs and describe the physics and emergent optical properties of various types of Cd-free QDs whose applications are discussed in subsequent sections. Selected specific QD systems are introduced, followed by the preparation of these Cd-free QDs in a form useful for biological applications, including recent advances in achieving high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) and tunability of emission color. Next, we summarize biophotonic applications of Cd-free QDs in optical imaging, photoacoustic imaging, sensing, optical tracking, and photothermal therapy. Research advances in the use of Cd-free QDs for nanomedicine applications are discussed, including drug\/gene delivery, protein\/peptide delivery, image-guided surgery, diagnostics, and medical devices. The review then considers the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of Cd-free QDs and summarizes current studies on the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of Cd-free QDs. Finally, we provide perspectives on the overall current status, challenges, and future directions in this field.","1496":"The four-membered oxetane ring has been increasingly exploited for its contrasting behaviors: its influence on physicochemical properties as a stable motif in medicinal chemistry and its propensity to undergo ring-opening reactions as a synthetic intermediate. These applications have driven numerous studies into the synthesis of new oxetane derivatives. This review takes an overview of the literature for the synthesis of oxetane derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last five years up to the end of 2015. These methods are clustered by strategies for preparation of the ring and further derivatization of preformed oxetane-containing building blocks. Examples of the use of oxetanes in medicinal chemistry are reported, including a collation of oxetane derivatives appearing in recent patents for medicinal chemistry applications. Finally, examples of oxetane derivatives in ring-opening and ring-expansion reactions are described.","1497":"Rod MOFs are metal-organic frameworks in which the metal-containing secondary building units consist of infinite rods of linked metal-centered polyhedra. For such materials, we identify the points of extension, often atoms, which define the interface between the organic and inorganic components of the structure. The pattern of points of extension defines a shape such as a helix, ladder, helical ribbon, or cylinder tiling. The linkage of these shapes into a three-dimensional framework in turn defines a net characteristic of the original structure. Some scores of rod MOF structures are illustrated and deconstructed into their underlying nets in this way. Crystallographic data for all nets in their maximum symmetry embeddings are provided.","1498":"Peptides are important biological molecular entities in biomedical research. They can be prepared in a large variety of shapes, with a host of chemical functions, and tailored for specific applications. Organometallic medicinal chemistry is a relatively young field that explores biomedical and bioanalytical applications of organometallic complexes, that is, metal compounds with at least one direct, covalent metal-carbon bond. The conjugation of peptides to such medicinally active organometallic moieties started only about 20 years ago, and it has been very beneficial for the development of bioorganometallic chemistry in general. Similarly, the biomedical properties of peptides have been altered by their conjugation to organometallic (OM) moieties. In this review, synthetic methods by which OM moieties can be conjugated to peptides via a carbon-metal bond are described, and selected medicinal applications of such conjugates are discussed. Inorganic coordination complexes between metal ions and peptides are excluded from this review. Also, the labeling of peptides with radiometals and applications of radiolabeled peptides will not be treated herein. First, modifications of the peptide backbone (either N- or C-terminally, or both) with organometallic moieties will be described, including the insertion of OM moieties as part of the peptide backbone. Then side-chain modifications will be reported, among them the most recent strategies for chemoselective arene metalation on peptides. Finally, approaches by which multiple metalation can be achieved are explored. In each section, selected examples of biological applications are highlighted.","1499":"","1500":"","1501":"The function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-which represent the largest class of both human membrane proteins and drug targets-depends critically on their ability to change shape, transitioning among distinct conformations. Determining the structural dynamics of GPCRs is thus essential both for understanding the physiology of these receptors and for the rational design of GPCR-targeted drugs. Here we review what is currently known about the flexibility and dynamics of GPCRs, as determined through crystallography, spectroscopy, and computer simulations. We first provide an overview of the types of motion exhibited by a GPCR and then discuss GPCR dynamics in the context of ligand binding, activation, allosteric modulation, and biased signaling. Finally, we discuss the implications of GPCR conformational plasticity for drug design.","1502":"Solution combustion is an exciting phenomenon, which involves propagation of self-sustained exothermic reactions along an aqueous or sol-gel media. This process allows for the synthesis of a variety of nanoscale materials, including oxides, metals, alloys, and sulfides. This Review focuses on the analysis of new approaches and results in the field of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) obtained during recent years. Thermodynamics and kinetics of reactive solutions used in different chemical routes are considered, and the role of process parameters is discussed, emphasizing the chemical mechanisms that are responsible for rapid self-sustained combustion reactions. The basic principles for controlling the composition, structure, and nanostructure of SCS products, and routes to regulate the size and morphology of the nanoscale materials are also reviewed. Recently developed systems that lead to the formation of novel materials and unique structures (e.g., thin films and two-dimensional crystals) with unusual properties are outlined. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, several application categories of SCS produced materials, such as for energy conversion and storage, optical devices, catalysts, and various important nanoceramics (e.g., bio-, electro-, magnetic), are discussed.","1503":"More than 80 years ago, artificial materials with molecular recognition sites emerged. The application of molecular imprinting to membrane separation has been studied since 1962. Especially after 1990, such research has been intensively conducted by membranologists and molecular imprinters to understand the advantages of each technique with the aim of constructing an ideal membrane, which is still an active area of research. The present review aims to be a substantial, comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and general-interest review, placed at the cross section of two broad, interconnected, practical, and extremely dynamic fields, namely, the fields of membrane separation and molecularly imprinted polymers. This review describes the recent discoveries that appeared after repeated and fertile collisions between these two fields in the past three years, to which are added the worthy acknowledgments of pioneering discoveries and a look into the future of molecularly imprinted membranes. The review begins with a general introduction in membrane separation, followed by a short theoretical section regarding the basic principles of mass transport through a membrane. Following these general aspects on membrane separation, two principles of obtaining polymeric materials with molecular recognition properties are reviewed, namely, molecular imprinting and alternative molecular imprinting, followed the methods of obtaining and practical applications for the particular case of molecularly imprinted membranes. The review continues with insights into molecularly imprinted nanofiber membranes as a promising, highly optimized type of membrane that could provide a relatively high throughput without a simultaneous unwanted reduction in permselectivity. Finally, potential applications of molecularly imprinted membranes in a variety of fields are highlighted, and a look into the future of membrane separations is offered.","1504":"Modern gas monitoring scenarios for medical diagnostics, environmental surveillance, industrial safety, and other applications demand new sensing capabilities. This Review provides analysis of development of new generation of gas sensors based on the multivariable response principles. Design criteria of these individual sensors involve a sensing material with multiresponse mechanisms to different gases and a multivariable transducer with independent outputs to recognize these different gas responses. These new sensors quantify individual components in mixtures, reject interferences, and offer more stable response over sensor arrays. Such performance is attractive when selectivity advantages of classic gas chromatography, ion mobility, and mass spectrometry instruments are canceled by requirements for no consumables, low power, low cost, and unobtrusive form factors for Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, and other applications. This Review is concluded with a perspective for future needs in fundamental and applied aspects of gas sensing and with the 2025 roadmap for ubiquitous gas monitoring.","1505":"Nature endows life with a wide variety of sophisticated, synergistic, and highly functional protein assemblies. Following Nature's inspiration to assemble protein building blocks into exquisite nanostructures is emerging as a fascinating research field. Dictating protein assembly to obtain highly ordered nanostructures and sophisticated functions not only provides a powerful tool to understand the natural protein assembly process but also offers access to advanced biomaterials. Over the past couple of decades, the field of protein assembly has undergone unexpected and rapid developments, and various innovative strategies have been proposed. This Review outlines recent advances in the field of protein assembly and summarizes several strategies, including biotechnological strategies, chemical strategies, and combinations of these approaches, for manipulating proteins to self-assemble into desired nanostructures. The emergent applications of protein assemblies as versatile platforms to design a wide variety of attractive functional materials with improved performances have also been discussed.

The basic chemistry concepts are critically emphasized at the very beginning as these are strongly correlated with the selection of ligands and the optimal formation of aqueous QDs and their more sophisticated structures. The synergies of biomimetic and biosynthetic methods that can combine biospecific reactivity with the robust and strong optical responses of QDs have also resulted in new approaches to the synthesis of the nanoparticles themselves. A related new avenue is the recent extension of QD synthesis to form nanoparticles endowed with chiral optical properties. The optical characteristics of QD materials and their advanced forms such as core\/shell heterostructures, alloys, and doped QDs are discussed: from the design considerations of optical band gap tuning, the control and reduction of the impact of surface traps, the consideration of charge carrier processes that affect emission and energy and charge transfer, to the impact and influence of lattice strain. We also describe the considerable progress in some selected QD applications such as in bioimaging and theranostics.

","1507":"The AID\/APOBEC family enzymes convert cytosines in single-stranded DNA to uracils, causing base substitutions and strand breaks. They are induced by cytokines produced during the body's inflammatory response to infections, and they help combat infections through diverse mechanisms. AID is essential for the maturation of antibodies and causes mutations and deletions in antibody genes through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) processes. One member of the APOBEC family, APOBEC1, edits mRNA for a protein involved in lipid transport. Members of the APOBEC3 subfamily in humans (APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H) inhibit infections of viruses such as HIV-1, HBV, and HCV, and retrotransposition of endogenous retroelements through mutagenic and nonmutagenic mechanisms. There is emerging consensus that these enzymes can cause mutations in the cellular genome at replication forks or within transcription bubbles depending on the physiological state of the cell and the phase of the cell cycle during which they are expressed. We describe here the state of knowledge about the structures of these enzymes, regulation of their expression, and both the advantageous and deleterious consequences of their expression, including carcinogenesis. We highlight similarities among them and present a holistic view of their regulation and function.","1508":"Colloidal nanoparticles are being intensely pursued in current nanoscience research. Nanochemists are often frustrated by the well-known fact that no two nanoparticles are the same, which precludes the deep understanding of many fundamental properties of colloidal nanoparticles in which the total structures (core plus surface) must be known. Therefore, controlling nanoparticles with atomic precision and solving their total structures have long been major dreams for nanochemists. Recently, these goals are partially fulfilled in the case of gold nanoparticles, at least in the ultrasmall size regime (1-3 nm in diameter, often called nanoclusters). This review summarizes the major progress in the field, including the principles that permit atomically precise synthesis, new types of atomic structures, and unique physical and chemical properties of atomically precise nanoparticles, as well as exciting opportunities for nanochemists to understand very fundamental science of colloidal nanoparticles (such as the stability, metal-ligand interfacial bonding, ligand assembly on particle surfaces, aesthetic structural patterns, periodicities, and emergence of the metallic state) and to develop a range of potential applications such as in catalysis, biomedicine, sensing, imaging, optics, and energy conversion. Although most of the research activity currently focuses on thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters, important progress has also been achieved in other ligand-protected gold, silver, and bimetal (or alloy) nanoclusters. All of these types of unique nanoparticles will bring unprecedented opportunities, not only in understanding the fundamental questions of nanoparticles but also in opening up new horizons for scientific studies of nanoparticles. ","1509":"There has been a renaissance of interest in exploring highly efficient thermoelectric materials as a possible route to address the worldwide energy generation, utilization, and management. This review describes the recent advances in designing high-performance bulk thermoelectric materials. We begin with the fundamental stratagem of achieving the greatest thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of a given material by carrier concentration engineering, including Fermi level regulation and optimum carrier density stabilization. We proceed to discuss ways of maximizing ZT at a constant doping level, such as increase of band degeneracy (crystal structure symmetry, band convergence), enhancement of band effective mass (resonant levels, band flattening), improvement of carrier mobility (modulation doping, texturing), and decrease of lattice thermal conductivity (synergistic alloying, second-phase nanostructuring, mesostructuring, and all-length-scale hierarchical architectures). We then highlight the decoupling of the electron and phonon transport through coherent interface, matrix\/precipitate electronic bands alignment, and compositionally alloyed nanostructures. Finally, recent discoveries of new compounds with intrinsically low thermal conductivity are summarized, where SnSe, BiCuSeO, MgAgSb, complex copper and bismuth chalcogenides, pnicogen-group chalcogenides with lone-pair electrons, and tetrahedrites are given particular emphasis. Future possible strategies for further enhancing ZT are considered at the end of this review.","1510":"Gel-nanocomposites are rapidly emerging functional advanced materials having widespread applications in materials and biological sciences. Herein, we review syntheses, properties, and applications of various gel-nanocomposites assembled from different metal-based nanoparticles or nanocarbons [fullerene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphenes] with tailor-made supramolecular (small molecular) or polymeric physical organogels and hydrogels. Dynamic supramolecular self-assembly of gelators prove to be excellent hosts for the incorporation of these dimensionally different nanomaterials. Thus, gel-nanocomposites doped with preformed\/in situ synthesized nanoparticles show magnetic or near-infrared-responsive, catalytic or antibacterial properties. Fullerene-based gel-nanocomposites show applications in organic solar cells. Gel-nanocomposites based on CNTs and graphenes and their functionalized (covalent\/noncovalent) analogues find interesting properties including electrical conductivity, viscoelasticity, thermal robustness, magnetic, phase-selective, redox and near-infrared radiation sensitive properties. We present appropriate rationale to explain most of these phenomena at the molecular level, which provide useful perspectives for future designs and new spin-offs. Finally, a possible outlook is projected for the design and syntheses of next generation multifunctional gel-nanocomposites, which could be achieved by increasing the complexity of the system upon adding selective nanomaterials with desired properties in a multicomponent mixture following a de novo design in order to take advantage of their individual properties.","1511":null,"1512":"The increase in the global atmospheric CO2 concentration resulting from over a century of combustion of fossil fuels has been associated with significant global climate change. With the global population increase driving continued increases in fossil fuel use, humanity's primary reliance on fossil energy for the next several decades is assured. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the direct removal of CO2 from the air, or \"direct air capture\" (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration. The past decade has seen a steep rise in the use of chemical sorbents that are cycled through sorption and desorption cycles for CO2 removal from ultradilute gases such as air. This Review provides a historical overview of the field of DAC, along with an exhaustive description of the use of chemical sorbents targeted at this application. Solvents and solid sorbents that interact strongly with CO2 are described, including basic solvents, supported amine and ammonium materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the primary classes of chemical sorbents. Hypothetical processes for the deployment of such sorbents are discussed, as well as the limited array of technoeconomic analyses published on DAC. Overall, it is concluded that there are many new materials that could play a role in emerging DAC technologies. However, these materials need to be further investigated and developed with a practical sorbent-air contacting process in mind if society is to make rapid progress in deploying DAC as a means of mitigating climate change.","1513":"In today's perspective, natural gas has gained considerable attention, due to its low emission, indigenous availability, and improvement in the extraction technology. Upon extraction, it undergoes several purification protocols including dehydration, sweetening, and inert rejection. Although purification is a commercially established technology, several drawbacks of the current process provide an essential impetus for developing newer separation protocols, most importantly, adsorption and membrane separation. This Review summarizes the needs of natural gas separation, gives an overview of the current technology, and provides a detailed discussion of the progress in research on separation and purification of natural gas including the benefits and drawbacks of each of the processes. The transportation sector is another growing sector of natural gas utilization, and it requires an efficient and safe on-board storage system. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are the most common forms in which natural gas can be stored. Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) is an alternate storage system of natural gas, which is advantageous as compared to CNG and LNG in terms of safety and also in terms of temperature and pressure requirements. This Review provides a detailed discussion on ANG along with computation predictions. The catalytic conversion of methane to different useful chemicals including syngas, methanol, formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, heavier hydrocarbons, aromatics, and hydrogen is also reviewed. Finally, direct utilization of methane onto fuel cells is also discussed.","1514":"Chemical methods developed over the past two decades enable preparation of colloidal nanocrystals with uniform size and shape. These Brownian objects readily order into superlattices. Recently, the range of accessible inorganic cores and tunable surface chemistries dramatically increased, expanding the set of nanocrystal arrangements experimentally attainable. In this review, we discuss efforts to create next-generation materials via bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is often driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence of the assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader with a practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly, and superlattice characterization. We then summarize the theory of nanocrystal interactions and examine fundamental principles governing nanocrystal self-assembly from hard and soft particle perspectives borrowed from the comparatively established fields of micrometer colloids and block copolymer assembly. We outline the extensive catalog of superlattices prepared to date using hydrocarbon-capped nanocrystals with spherical, polyhedral, rod, plate, and branched inorganic core shapes, as well as those obtained by mixing combinations thereof. We also provide an overview of structural defects in nanocrystal superlattices. We then explore the unique possibilities offered by leveraging nontraditional surface chemistries and assembly environments to control superlattice structure and produce nonbulk assemblies. We end with a discussion of the unique optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties of ordered nanocrystal superlattices, and the coming advances required to make use of this new class of solids.

Inherently solvent and ligand-free, nonthermal plasmas offer the ability to synthesize high purity nanocrystals of materials that require high synthesis temperatures. The nonequilibrium environment in nonthermal plasmas has a number of attractive attributes: energetic surface reactions selectively heat the nanoparticles to temperatures that can strongly exceed the gas temperature; charging of nanoparticles through plasma electrons reduces or eliminates nanoparticle agglomeration; and the large difference between the chemical potentials of the gaseous growth species and the species bound to the nanoparticle surfaces facilitates nanocrystal doping. This paper reviews the state of the art in nonthermal plasma synthesis of nanocrystals. It discusses the fundamentals of nanocrystal formation in plasmas, reviews practical implementations of plasma reactors, surveys the materials that have been produced with nonthermal plasmas and surface chemistries that have been developed, and provides an overview of applications of plasma-synthesized nanocrystals.

When the unique modes of activation exhibited by gold species meet species with either fluorinated building blocks or fluorinating reagents, new opportunities arise for the development of new methodologies in fluoroorganic chemistry. Indeed, gold and fluorine truly formed a very fruitful partnership, and different types of reactivity emerged from their combination. This review gives an overview of such endeavors. The special properties imparted by fluorine to organic molecules have been exploited in gold-catalyzed processes, allowing for the generation of unprecedented fluorinated chemical entities. Thus, the interaction of gold salts with fluorinated building blocks has been revised. In a second section, recent developments in gold-catalyzed nucleophilic fluorinations have been covered. The development of new gold catalysts that stabilize the Au-F bond as well as recent mechanistic studies in the field raised the interest of these types of methodologies for the generation of new C-F bonds. The use of electrophilic fluorine sources enabled new modes of gold catalysis. The incorporation of Selectfluor as an external oxidant constituted a new paradigm in gold chemistry, incorporating the elusive Au(I)\/Au(III) redox couple in gold-catalyzed transformations. This strategy provided access to both new fluorinated chemical entities and nonfluorinated derivatives by means of coupling reactions.

Organic gain materials are highly attractive for lasing due to their chemical tunability and large stimulated emission cross section. While the traditional dye laser has been largely replaced by solid-state lasers, a number of new and miniaturized organic lasers have emerged that hold great potential for lab-on-chip applications, biointegration, low-cost sensing and related areas, which benefit from the unique properties of organic gain materials. On the fundamental level, these include high exciton binding energy, low refractive index (compared to inorganic semiconductors), and ease of spectral and chemical tuning. On a technological level, mechanical flexibility and compatibility with simple processing techniques such as printing, roll-to-roll, self-assembly, and soft-lithography are most relevant. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive review of the developments in the field over the past decade, discussing recent advances in organic gain materials, which are today often based on solid-state organic semiconductors, as well as optical feedback structures, and device fabrication.

BER counters the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of damage that occurs continuously to the nitrogenous bases in DNA, and its critical role in maintaining genomic integrity is well established. However, BER also performs essential functions in processes other than DNA repair, where it acts on naturally modified bases in DNA. A prominent example is the central role of BER in mediating active DNA demethylation, a multistep process that erases the epigenetic mark 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and derivatives thereof, converting them back to cytosine. Herein, we review recent advances in the understanding of how BER mediates this critical component of epigenetic regulation in plants and animals.","1524":"The subject of this review is the colloidal quantum dot (QD) and specifically the interaction of the QD with proximate molecules. It covers various functions of these molecules, including (i) ligands for the QDs, coupled electronically or vibrationally to localized surface states or to the delocalized states of the QD core, (ii) energy or electron donors or acceptors for the QDs, and (iii) structural components of QD assemblies that dictate QD-QD or QD-molecule interactions. Research on interactions of ligands with colloidal QDs has revealed that ligands determine not only the excited state dynamics of the QD but also, in some cases, its ground state electronic structure. Specifically, the article discusses (i) measurement of the electronic structure of colloidal QDs and the influence of their surface chemistry, in particular, dipolar ligands and exciton-delocalizing ligands, on their electronic energies; (ii) the role of molecules in interfacial electron and energy transfer processes involving QDs, including electron-to-vibrational energy transfer and the use of the ligand shell of a QD as a semipermeable membrane that gates its redox activity; and (iii) a particular application of colloidal QDs, photoredox catalysis, which exploits the combination of the electronic structure of the QD core and the chemistry at its surface to use the energy of the QD excited state to drive chemical reactions.","1525":"Chlorophylls make Earth green, are the central constituents in the engine of photosynthesis, and not surprisingly have garnered immense attention. A chlorin, the core chromophore of a chlorophyll, is a dihydroporphyrin macrocycle that contains one pyrroline ring and three pyrrole rings. The dominant method for the synthesis of chlorins has entailed the derivatization of porphyrins. The present review covers the ostensibly simple conversion of porphyrins, regardless of synthetic or biological origin, to chlorins. The period covered encompasses the entire history since the beginnings of chlorin synthetic chemistry in the early 20th century through 2015. Representative transformations include hydrogenation, cycloaddition, annulation, and diverse \"breaking and mending\" approaches. Altogether, the synthesis of &gt;1000 chlorins or chlorin-like compounds (containing &gt;50 distinct pyrroline motifs) is described. Such diversity animates the question \"what structural features are essential for a chlorin to resemble chlorophyll?\" To begin to address the structure-spectrum relationship, &gt; 250 absorption spectra are provided for representative structures. The synthesis and spectral properties of the vast collection of compounds described herein are expected to illuminate the scope to which synthetic chlorins can serve as surrogates for chlorophylls and be exploited in diverse ways.","1526":"The easily rotatable peripheral aromatic rings around central benzene in hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives create a very intriguing nonplanar, propeller-shaped geometry. Because of the very low susceptibility toward self-aggregation, HAB derivatives are much stronger candidates among various polyphenylenes\/hetero-oligophenylenes when poor molecular cohesion and inefficient packing is required. However, the native properties of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) can be varied by proper tailoring and substitution of the HAB core. The cohesion and packing in the structures of HAB aggregates induce effective structural variations so as to modify the fundamental features. Recently, HAB derivatives attracted a lot of research interest because of their significant role as liquid crystalline materials, organic light-emitting diodes, photochemical switches, redox materials, and molecular receptors. Herein, detailed attention is given to the pioneering work based on synthetic optimization of different HAB cores, elaborated study of their crystal engineering, various interesting applications of HAB derivatives, and future possibilities and capabilities of this still underexplored scaffold.

Knowledge of free energies for cleaving metal hydride bonds enables the prediction of chemical reactivity, such as for the bond-forming and bond-breaking events that occur in a catalytic reaction. Thermodynamic hydricity is the free energy required to cleave an M-H bond to generate a hydride ion (H(-)). Three primary methods have been developed for hydricity determination: the hydride transfer method establishes hydride transfer equilibrium with a hydride donor\/acceptor pair of known hydricity, the H2 heterolysis method involves measuring the equilibrium of heterolytic cleavage of H2 in the presence of a base, and the potential-pKa method considers stepwise transfer of a proton and two electrons to give a net hydride transfer. Using these methods, over 100 thermodynamic hydricity values for transition metal hydrides have been determined in acetonitrile or water. In acetonitrile, the hydricity of metal hydrides spans a range of more than 50 kcal\/mol. Methods for using hydricity values to predict chemical reactivity are also discussed, including organic transformations, the reduction of CO2, and the production and oxidation of hydrogen.

The substitution of conventional metals as redox-active material by organic materials offers a promising alternative for the next generation of rechargeable batteries since these organic batteries are excelling in charging speed and cycling stability. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these systems and discusses the numerous classes of organic, polymer-based active materials as well as auxiliary components of the battery, like additives or electrolytes. Moreover, a definition of important cell characteristics and an introduction to selected characterization techniques is provided, completed by the discussion of potential socio-economic impacts.

The intramolecular double hydrogen transfer occurring in the ground and electronically excited states leads to uncommon spectroscopic characteristics, such as depolarized emission, viscosity-dependent radiationless depopulation, and vibrational-mode-specific tunneling splittings. This review starts with documentation of the electronic spectra of porphycenes: Absorption and magnetic circular dichroism are discussed, together with their analysis based on the perimeter model. Next, photophysical characteristics are presented, setting the stage for the final part, which discusses the developments in research on tautomerism. Porphycenes have been studied in different experimental regimes: molecules in condensed phases, isolated in supersonic jets and helium nanodroplets, and, recently also on the level of single molecules investigated by optical and scanning probe microscopies. Because of the rich and detailed information obtained from these diverse investigations, porphycenes emerge as very good models for studying the complex, multidimensional phenomena involved in the process of intramolecular double hydrogen transfer.","1532":null,"1533":"Cofactor-mimetic aerobic oxidation has conceptually merged with catalysis of syngas reactions to form a wide range of Markovnikov-selective olefin radical hydrofunctionalizations.

","1534":"With the arising of global climate change and resource shortage, in recent years, increased attention has been paid to environmentally friendly materials. Trees are sustainable and renewable materials, which give us shelter and oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees are a primary resource that human society depends upon every day, for example, homes, heating, furniture, and aircraft. Wood from trees gives us paper, cardboard, and medical supplies, thus impacting our homes, school, work, and play. All of the above-mentioned applications have been well developed over the past thousands of years. However, trees and wood have much more to offer us as advanced materials, impacting emerging high-tech fields, such as bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Wood naturally has a hierarchical structure, composed of well-oriented microfibers and tracheids for water, ion, and oxygen transportation during metabolism. At higher magnification, the walls of fiber cells have an interesting morphology-a distinctly mesoporous structure. Moreover, the walls of fiber cells are composed of thousands of fibers (or macrofibrils) oriented in a similar angle. Nanofibrils and nanocrystals can be further liberated from macrofibrils by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. The obtained nanocellulose has unique optical, mechanical, and barrier properties and is an excellent candidate for chemical modification and reconfiguration. Wood is naturally a composite material, comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Wood is sustainable, earth abundant, strong, biodegradable, biocompatible, and chemically accessible for modification; more importantly, multiscale natural fibers from wood have unique optical properties applicable to different kinds of optoelectronics and photonic devices. Today, the materials derived from wood are ready to be explored for applications in new technology areas, such as electronics, biomedical devices, and energy. The goal of this study is to review the fundamental structures and chemistries of wood and wood-derived materials, which are essential for a wide range of existing and new enabling technologies. The scope of the review covers multiscale materials and assemblies of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as other biomaterials derived from wood, in regard to their major emerging applications. Structure-properties-application relationships will be investigated in detail. Understanding the fundamental properties of these structures is crucial for designing and manufacturing products for emerging applications. Today, a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and performance of wood and wood-derived materials is advancing historical applications of these materials. This new level of understanding also enables a myriad of new and exciting applications, which motivate this review. There are excellent reviews already on the classical topic of woody materials, and some recent reviews also cover new understanding of these materials as well as potential applications. This review will focus on the uniqueness of woody materials for three critical applications: green electronics, biological devices, and energy storage and bioenergy.","1535":"The aim of this review is to highlight how the diversity generated by N-substitution in the well-known short-bite ligand bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (DPPA) allows a fine-tuning of the ligand properties and offers a considerable scope for tailoring the properties and applications of their corresponding metal complexes. The various N-substituents include nitrogen-, oxygen-, phosphorus-, sulfur-, halogen-, and silicon-based functionalities and directly N-bound metals. Multiple DPPA-type ligands linked through an organic spacer and N-functionalized DRPA-type ligands, in which the PPh2 substituents are replaced by PR2 (R = alkyl, benzyl) groups, are also discussed. Owing to the considerable diversity of N-functionalized DPPA-type ligands available, the applications of their mono- and polynuclear metal complexes are very diverse and range from homogeneous catalysis with well-defined or in situ generated (pre)catalysts to heterogeneous catalysis and materials science. In particular, sustained interest for DPPA-type ligands has been motivated, at least in part, by their ability to promote selective ethylene tri- or tetramerization in combination with chromium. Ligands and metal complexes where the N-substituent is a pure hydrocarbon group (as opposed to N-functionalization) are outside the scope of this review. However, when possible, a comparison between the catalytic performances of N-functionalized systems with those of their N-substituted analogs will be provided.","1536":"Hydride complexes of copper, silver, and gold encompass a broad array of structures, and their distinctive reactivity has enabled dramatic recent advances in synthesis and catalysis.

It discusses catalytic processes in which coinage metal hydrides are known or probable intermediates, and presents mechanistic studies of selected catalytic reactions. The purpose of this Review is to convey how developments in coinage metal hydride chemistry have led to new organic transformations, and how developments in catalysis have in turn inspired the synthesis of reactive new complexes. ","1537":"Decreased antimicrobial efficiency has become a global public health issue. The paucity of new antibacterial drugs is evident, and the arsenal against infectious diseases needs to be improved urgently. The selection of plants as a source of prototype compounds is appropriate, since plant species naturally produce a wide range of secondary metabolites that act as a chemical line of defense against microorganisms in the environment. Although traditional approaches to combat microbial infections remain effective, targeting microbial virulence rather than survival seems to be an exciting strategy, since the modulation of virulence factors might lead to a milder evolutionary pressure for the development of resistance. Additionally, anti-infective chemotherapies may be successfully achieved by combining antivirulence and conventional antimicrobials, extending the lifespan of these drugs. This review presents an updated discussion of natural compounds isolated from plants with chemically characterized structures and activity against the major bacterial virulence factors: quorum sensing, bacterial biofilms, bacterial motility, bacterial toxins, bacterial pigments, bacterial enzymes, and bacterial surfactants. Moreover, a critical analysis of the most promising virulence factors is presented, highlighting their potential as targets to attenuate bacterial virulence. The ongoing progress in the field of antivirulence therapy may therefore help to translate this promising concept into real intervention strategies in clinical areas.","1538":"Nickel hydride complexes, defined herein as any molecules bearing a nickel hydrogen bond, are crucial intermediates in numerous nickel-catalyzed reactions.

","1540":"In this paper, we review recent progress on colloidal growth of 2D nanocrystals. We identify the four main sources of anisotropy which lead to the formation of plate- and sheet-like colloidal nanomaterials. Defect-induced anisotropy is a growth method which relies on the presence of topological defects at the nanoscale to induce 2D shapes objects. Such a method is particularly important in the growth of metallic nano-objects. Another way to induce anisotropy is based on ligand engineering. The availability of some nanocrystal facets can be tuned by selectively covering the surface with ligands of tunable thickness. Cadmium chalcogenides nanoplatelets (NPLs) strongly rely on this method which offers atomic control in the thinner direction, down to a few monolayers. Two-dimensional objects can also be obtained by post or in situ self-assembly of nanocrystals. This growth method differs from the previous ones in the sense that the elementary objects are not molecular precursors and is a common method for lead chalcogenide compounds. Finally, anisotropy may simply rely on the lattice anisotropy itself as it is common for rod-like nanocrystals. Colloidally grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) in particular result from such process. We also present hybrid syntheses which combine several of the previously described methods and other paths, such as cation exchange, which expand the range of available materials. Finally, we discuss in which sense 2D objects differ from 0D nanocrystals and review some of their applications in optoelectronics, including lasing and photodetection, and biology.

Through evolution, genetic drift, and speciation, photosynthetic organisms have discovered many solutions for light harvesting. In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules. In the latter half of the article, we focus on the light-harvesting complexes of purple bacteria as a model to illustrate the present understanding of the synergetic effects leading to EET optimization of light-harvesting antenna systems while exploring the structure and function of the integral chromophores. We end this review with a brief overview of the energy-transfer dynamics and pathways in the light-harvesting antennas of various photosynthetic organisms.","1542":"Rapid progress in identifying biomarkers that are hallmarks of disease has increased demand for high-performance detection technologies.

It has been exploited to design different types of photocatalytic reactions and to obtain NMR spectra of dilute solutions with a single pulse of an NMR spectrometer. Because photolysis can be performed on fast time scales and at low temperature, metal-hydride photochemistry has enabled determination of the molecular structure and rates of reaction of highly reactive intermediates. We identify five characteristic photoprocesses of metal monohydride complexes associated with the M-H bond, of which the most widespread are M-H homolysis and R-H reductive elimination. For metal dihydride complexes, the dominant photoprocess is reductive elimination of H2. Dihydrogen complexes typically lose H2 photochemically. The majority of photochemical reactions are likely to be dissociative, but hydride complexes may be designed with equilibrated excited states that undergo different photochemical reactions, including proton transfer or hydride transfer. The photochemical mechanisms of a few reactions have been analyzed by computational methods, including quantum dynamics.

","1553":"Water is the most abundant liquid on earth and also the substance with the largest number of anomalies in its properties. It is a prerequisite for life and as such a most important subject of current research in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In spite of its simplicity as a liquid, it has an enormously rich phase diagram where different types of ices, amorphous phases, and anomalies disclose a path that points to unique thermodynamics of its supercooled liquid state that still hides many unraveled secrets. In this review we describe the behavior of water in the regime from ambient conditions to the deeply supercooled region. The review describes simulations and experiments on this anomalous liquid. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous properties that become strongly enhanced in the supercooled region. Among those, the second critical-point scenario has been investigated extensively, and at present most experimental evidence point to this scenario. Starting from very low temperatures, a coexistence line between a high-density amorphous phase and a low-density amorphous phase would continue in a coexistence line between a high-density and a low-density liquid phase terminating in a liquid-liquid critical point, LLCP. On approaching this LLCP from the one-phase region, a crossover in thermodynamics and dynamics can be found. This is discussed based on a picture of a temperature-dependent balance between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid favored by, respectively, entropy and enthalpy, leading to a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of bulk water. Ice nucleation is also discussed, since this is what severely impedes experimental investigation of the vicinity of the proposed LLCP. Experimental investigation of stretched water, i.e., water at negative pressure, gives access to a different regime of the complex water diagram. Different ways to inhibit crystallization through confinement and aqueous solutions are discussed through results from experiments and simulations using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques. These findings represent tiles of a global picture that still needs to be completed. Some of the possible experimental lines of research that are essential to complete this picture are explored.","1554":"The electronics surrounding us in our daily lives rely almost exclusively on electrons as the dominant charge carrier. In stark contrast, biological systems rarely use electrons but rather use ions and molecules of varying size.

Our aim is to present a comprehensive review of recent research activities on bimetallic nanocrystals. We begin with a brief introduction to the architectural diversity of bimetallic nanocrystals, followed by discussion of the various synthetic techniques necessary for controlling the elemental ratio and spatial arrangement. We have selected key examples from the literature that exemplify critical concepts and place a special emphasis on mechanistic understanding.

Synthetic modeling of the many H2ase states has provided insight into H2ase structure and mechanism, as well as afforded catalysts for the H2 energy vector. Particularly important are hydride-bearing states, with synthetic hydride analogues now known for each hydrogenase class. These hydrides are typically prepared by protonation of low-valent cores. Examples of FeFe and NiFe hydrides derived from H2 have also been prepared. Such chemistry is more developed than mimicry of the redox-inactive monoFe enzyme, although functional models of the latter are now emerging.

Traditional routes to these building blocks have commonly involved multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, and the use of stoichiometric and\/or toxic reagents. In this regard, using transition metals to catalyze the synthesis of organohalides has become a mature field in itself, and applying these technologies has allowed for a decrease in the production of waste, higher levels of regio- and stereoselectivity, and the ability to produce enantioenriched target compounds. Furthermore, transition metals offer the distinct advantage of possessing a diverse spectrum of mechanistic possibilities which translate to the capability to apply new substrate classes and afford novel and difficult-to-access structures. This Review provides comprehensive coverage of modern transition metal-catalyzed syntheses of organohalides via a diverse array of mechanisms. Attention is given to the seminal stoichiometric organometallic studies which led to the corresponding catalytic processes being realized. By breaking this field down into the synthesis of aryl, vinyl, and alkyl halides, it becomes clear which methods have surfaced as most favored for each individual class. In general, a pronounced shift toward the use of C-H bonds as key functional groups, in addition to methods which proceed by catalytic, radical-based mechanisms has occurred. Although always evolving, this field appears to be heading in the direction of using starting materials with a significantly lower degree of prefunctionalization in addition to less expensive and abundant metal catalysts.","1561":"Photocurrent generation in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is most commonly understood as a process which predominantly involves photoexcitation of the lower ionization potential species (donor) followed by electron transfer to the higher electron affinity material (acceptor) [i.e., photoinduced electron transfer (PET), which we term Channel I]. A mirror process also occurs in which photocurrent is generated through photoexcitation of the acceptor followed by hole transfer to the nonexcited donor or photoinduced hole transfer (PHT), which we term Channel II. The role of Channel II photocurrent generation has often been neglected due to overlap of the individual absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor materials that are commonly used. More recently Channel II charge generation has been explored for several reasons. First, many of the new high-efficiency polymeric donors are used as the minority component in bulk heterojunction blends, and therefore, the acceptor absorption is a significant fraction of the total; second, nonfullerene acceptors have been prepared, which through careful design, allow for spectral separation from the donor material, facilitating fundamental studies on charge generation. In this article, we review the methodologies for investigating the two charge generation channels. We also discuss the factors that affect charge generation via Channel I and II pathways, including energy levels of the materials involved, exciton diffusion, and other considerations. Finally, we take a comprehensive look at the nonfullerene acceptor literature and discuss what information about Channel I and Channel II can be obtained from the experiments conducted and what other experiments could be undertaken to provide further information about the operational efficiencies of Channels I and II.","1562":"The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediates a wide range of physiological responses and serves as an important category of drug targets.

Aromatic rings would in principle be ideal reaction partners, as they contain, at least from the topological point of view, both olefinic and diene subunits; however, the stability of the conjugated aromatic system would be broken by cycloaddition reactions, which are therefore rarely applied, because kinetics and thermodynamics hinder the process. From that aspect, photochemical activation opens interesting perspectives, as one can selectively provide excess energy to one of the reactants but not to the product, thus preventing thermal back reaction. Indeed, aromatic rings show a rich photochemistry, ranging from isomerizations, substitutions, and additions to cycloadditions.

In this review we provide an overview of coarse-grained models focusing on their design, including choices of representation, models of energy functions, sampling of conformational space, and applications in the modeling of protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. A more detailed description is given for applications of coarse-grained models suitable for efficient combinations with all-atom simulations in multiscale modeling strategies.","1566":"Over the past decade there has been a revolution in the field of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structural biology. Many years of innovative research from different areas have come together to fuel this significant change in the fortunes of this field, which for many years was characterized by the paucity of high-resolution structures. The determination to succeed has been in part due to the recognized importance of these proteins as drug targets, and although the pharmaceutical industry has been focusing on these receptors, it can be justifiably argued and demonstrated that many of the approved and commercially successful GPCR drugs can be significantly improved to increase efficacy and\/or reduce undesired side effects. In addition, many validated targets in this class remain to be drugged. It is widely recognized that application of structure-based drug design approaches can help medicinal chemists a long way toward discovering better drugs. The achievement of structural biologists in providing high-resolution insight is beginning to transform drug discovery efforts, and there are a number of GPCR drugs that have been discovered by use of structural information that are in clinical development.

The current surge in MHP research has largely arisen out of their rapid progress in PV devices; however, these materials are potentially suitable for a diverse array of optoelectronic applications. Like oxide perovskites, MHPs have ABX3 stoichiometry, where A and B are cations and X is a halide anion. Here, the underlying physical and photophysical properties of inorganic (A = inorganic) and hybrid organic-inorganic (A = organic) MHPs are reviewed with an eye toward their potential application in emerging optoelectronic technologies. Significant attention is given to the prototypical compound methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) due to the preponderance of experimental and theoretical studies surrounding this material. We also discuss other salient MHP systems, including 2-dimensional compounds, where relevant. More specifically, this review is a critical account of the interrelation between MHP electronic structure, absorption, emission, carrier dynamics and transport, and other relevant photophysical processes that have propelled these materials to the forefront of modern optoelectronics research.","1568":"Focusing on the recent literature (since 2000), this review outlines the main synthetic approaches for the preparation of 5'-mono-, 5'-di-, and 5'-triphosphorylated nucleosides, also known as nucleotides, as well as several derivatives, namely, cyclic nucleotides and dinucleotides, dinucleoside 5',5'-polyphosphates, sugar nucleotides, and nucleolipids. Endogenous nucleotides and their analogues can be obtained enzymatically, which is often restricted to natural substrates, or chemically. In chemical synthesis, protected or unprotected nucleosides can be used as the starting material, depending on the nature of the reagents selected from P(III) or P(V) species. Both solution-phase and solid-support syntheses have been developed and are reported here.

Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) are a particularly rich but still underexploited source of such modified variant nucleotides. The modifications conserve the coding and base-pairing functions of DNA, but add regulatory and protective functions. In prokaryotes, modified bases appear primarily to be part of an arms race between bacteriophages (and other genomic parasites) and their hosts, although, as in eukaryotes, some modifications have been adapted to convey epigenetic information. The first half of this review catalogs the identification and diversity of DNA modifications found in bacteria and bacteriophages. What is known about the biogenesis, context, and function of these modifications are also described. The second part of the review places these DNA modifications in the context of the arms race between bacteria and bacteriophages.

Besides their obvious importance in acid-base chemistry, these ions play an important role in numerous applications ranging from enzyme catalysis to environmental chemistry. Despite a long history of research, many fundamental issues regarding their properties continue to be an active area of research. Here, we provide a review of the experimental and theoretical advances made in the last several decades in understanding the structure, dynamics, and transport of the proton and hydroxide ions in different aqueous environments, ranging from water clusters to the bulk liquid and its interfaces with hydrophobic surfaces. The propensity of these ions to accumulate at hydrophobic surfaces has been a subject of intense debate, and we highlight the open issues and challenges in this area. Biological applications reviewed include proton transport along the hydration layer of various membranes and through channel proteins, problems that are at the core of cellular bioenergetics.","1572":"The cyanine platforms including cyanine, hemicyanine, and squaraine are good candidates for developing chemosensors because of their excellent photophysical properties, outstanding biocompatibility, and low toxicity to living systems. A huge amount of research work involving chemosensors based on the cyanine platforms has emerged in recent years. This review focuses on the development from 2000 to 2015, in which cyanine, hemicyanine, and squaraine sensors will be separately summarized. In each section, a systematization according to the type of detection mechanism is established. The basic principles about the design of the chemosensors and their applications as bioimaging agents are clearly discussed. In addition, we emphasize the advances that have been made in improving the detection performance through incorporation of the chemosensors into nanoparticles.","1573":"Although the Hertz-Knudsen (HK) relation is often used to correlate evaporation data, the relation contains two empirical parameters (the evaporation and condensation coefficients) that have inexplicably been found to span 3 orders of magnitude. Explicit expressions for these coefficients have yet to be determined. This review will examine sources of error in the HK relation that have led to the coefficients' scatter. Through an examination of theoretical, experimental, and molecular dynamics simulation studies of evaporation, this review will show that the HK relation is incomplete, since it is missing an important physical concept: the coupling between the vapor and liquid phases during evaporation. The review also examines a modified HK relation, obtained from the quantum-mechanically based statistical rate theory (SRT) expression for the evaporation flux and applying a limit to it in which the thermal energy is dominant. Explicit expressions for the evaporation and condensation coefficients are defined in this limit, with the surprising result that the coefficients are not bounded by unity. An examination is made with 127 reported evaporation experiments of water and of ethanol, leading to a new physical interpretation of the coefficients. The review concludes by showing how seemingly small simplifications, such as assuming thermal equilibrium across the liquid-vapor interface during evaporation, can lead to the erroneous predictions from the HK relation that have been reported in the literature.","1574":"","1575":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are historically the most successful family of drug targets. In recent times it has become clear that the pharmacology of these receptors is far more complex than previously imagined. Understanding of the pharmacological regulation of GPCRs now extends beyond simple competitive agonism or antagonism by ligands interacting with the orthosteric binding site of the receptor to incorporate concepts of allosteric agonism, allosteric modulation, signaling bias, constitutive activity, and inverse agonism. Herein, we consider how evolving concepts of GPCR pharmacology have shaped understanding of the complex pharmacology of receptors that recognize and are activated by nonesterified or \"free\" fatty acids (FFAs). The FFA family of receptors is a recently deorphanized set of GPCRs, the members of which are now receiving substantial interest as novel targets for the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Further understanding of the complex pharmacology of these receptors will be critical to unlocking their ultimate therapeutic potential.","1576":"Recent advances in controlled\/living polymerization techniques and highly efficient coupling chemistries have enabled the facile synthesis of complex polymer architectures with controlled dimensions and functionality. As an example, star polymers consist of many linear polymers fused at a central point with a large number of chain end functionalities.

Among other rationale, the inability to influence photochemical reactions with temperature, solvent, additives, etc., dissuades chemists from employing light-initiated reactions as a routine synthetic tool. This review highlights how diverse, highly organized structures such as solvent-free crystals and water-soluble host-guest assemblies can be employed to control and manipulate photoreactions and thereby serve as an efficient tool for chemists, including those interested in synthesis. The efficacy of the media in modifying the excited-state behavior of organic molecules is illustrated with photocycloaddition in general and [2 + 2] photocycloaddition in particular, reactions widely employed in the synthesis of complex natural products as well as highly constrained molecules, as exemplars. The reaction media, highly pertinent in the context of green sustainable chemistry, include solvent-free crystals and solids such as silica, clay, and zeolite and water-soluble hosts that can solubilize and preorganize hydrophobic reactants in water. Since no other reagent would be more sustainable than light and no other medium greener than water, we believe that the supramolecular photochemistry expounded here has a momentous role as a synthetic tool in the future.","1584":"Advances in the design and application of highly efficient conjugated polymers and small molecules over the past years have enabled the rapid progress in the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology as a promising alternative to conventional solar cells.

Photon-induced ionization followed by detection of electrons from either the O 1s level or the valence band is the basis of photoelectron spectroscopy. Excitation between the O 1s and the unoccupied states or occupied states is utilized in X-ray absorption and X-ray emission spectroscopies. These techniques probe the electronic structure of the liquid phase and show sensitivity to the local hydrogen-bonding structure. Both experimental aspects related to the measurements and theoretical simulations to assist in the interpretation are discussed in detail. Different model systems are presented such as the different bulk phases of ice and various adsorbed monolayer structures on metal surfaces.","1587":"The interfaces of neat water and aqueous solutions play a prominent role in many technological processes and in the environment. Examples of aqueous interfaces are ultrathin water films that cover most hydrophilic surfaces under ambient relative humidities, the liquid\/solid interface which drives many electrochemical reactions, and the liquid\/vapor interface, which governs the uptake and release of trace gases by the oceans and cloud droplets.

As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.","1589":"Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as indium tin oxide and zinc oxide, play an important role as electrode materials in organic-semiconductor devices. The properties of the inorganic-organic interface-the offset between the TCO Fermi level and the relevant transport level, the extent to which the organic semiconductor can wet the oxide surface, and the influence of the surface on semiconductor morphology-significantly affect device performance. This review surveys the literature on TCO modification with phosphonic acids (PAs), which has increasingly been used to engineer these interfacial properties. The first part outlines the relevance of TCO surface modification to organic electronics, surveys methods for the synthesis of PAs, discusses the modes by which they can bind to TCO surfaces, and compares PAs to alternative organic surface modifiers. The next section discusses methods of PA monolayer deposition, the kinetics of monolayer formation, and structural evidence regarding molecular orientation on TCOs. The next sections discuss TCO work-function modification using PAs, tuning of TCO surface energy using PAs, and initiation of polymerizations from TCO-tethered PAs.

The applications of bromine, a total of 107 bromo-organic compounds, 11 other brominating agents, and a few natural bromine sources were incorporated. The scope of these reagents for various organic transformations such as bromination, cohalogenation, oxidation, cyclization, ring-opening reactions, substitution, rearrangement, hydrolysis, catalysis, etc. has been described briefly to highlight important aspects of the bromo-organic compounds in organic synthesis.","1591":"As a fascinating conjugated polymer, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has become a new research hotspot and drawn broad interdisciplinary attention as a metal-free and visible-light-responsive photocatalyst in the arena of solar energy conversion and environmental remediation. This is due to its appealing electronic band structure, high physicochemical stability, and \"earth-abundant\" nature. This critical review summarizes a panorama of the latest progress related to the design and construction of pristine g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-based nanocomposites, including (1) nanoarchitecture design of bare g-C3N4, such as hard and soft templating approaches, supramolecular preorganization assembly, exfoliation, and template-free synthesis routes, (2) functionalization of g-C3N4 at an atomic level (elemental doping) and molecular level (copolymerization), and (3) modification of g-C3N4 with well-matched energy levels of another semiconductor or a metal as a cocatalyst to form heterojunction nanostructures. The construction and characteristics of each classification of the heterojunction system will be critically reviewed, namely metal-g-C3N4, semiconductor-g-C3N4, isotype g-C3N4\/g-C3N4, graphitic carbon-g-C3N4, conducting polymer-g-C3N4, sensitizer-g-C3N4, and multicomponent heterojunctions.

Last but not least, this comprehensive review will conclude with a summary and some invigorating perspectives on the challenges and future directions at the forefront of this research platform. It is anticipated that this review can stimulate a new research doorway to facilitate the next generation of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts with ameliorated performances by harnessing the outstanding structural, electronic, and optical properties for the development of a sustainable future without environmental detriment.","1592":"The integration of a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into host chromatin is the defining step of retroviral replication. This enzymatic process is catalyzed by the virus-encoded integrase protein, which is conserved among retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons. Retroviral integration proceeds via two integrase activities: 3'-processing of the viral DNA ends, followed by the strand transfer of the processed ends into host cell chromosomal DNA. Herein we review the molecular mechanism of retroviral DNA integration, with an emphasis on reaction chemistries and architectures of the nucleoprotein complexes involved. We additionally discuss the latest advances on anti-integrase drug development for the treatment of AIDS and the utility of integrating retroviral vectors in gene therapy applications.","1593":"This review article focuses on the most recent advances in X-ray and neutron scattering studies of water structure, from ambient temperature to the deeply supercooled and amorphous states, and of water diffusive and collective dynamics, in disparate thermodynamic conditions and environments. In particular, the ability to measure X-ray and neutron diffraction of water with unprecedented high accuracy in an extended range of momentum transfers has allowed the derivation of detailed O-O pair correlation functions. A panorama of the diffusive dynamics of water in a wide range of temperatures (from 400 K down to supercooled water) and pressures (from ambient up to multiple gigapascals) is presented. The recent results obtained by quasi-elastic neutron scattering under high pressure are compared with the existing data from nuclear magnetic resonance, dielectric and infrared measurements, and modeling. A detailed description of the vibrational dynamics of water as measured by inelastic neutron scattering is presented. The dependence of the water vibrational density of states on temperature and pressure, and in the presence of biological molecules, is discussed. Results about the collective dynamics of water and its dispersion curves as measured by coherent inelastic neutron scattering and inelastic X-ray scattering in different thermodynamic conditions are reported.","1594":"DNA transposons are defined segments of DNA that are able to move from one genomic location to another. Movement is facilitated by one or more proteins, called the transposase, typically encoded by the mobile element itself. Here, we first provide an overview of the classification of such mobile elements in a variety of organisms. From a mechanistic perspective, we have focused on one particular group of DNA transposons that encode a transposase with a DD(E\/D) catalytic domain that is topologically similar to RNase H. For these, a number of three-dimensional structures of transpososomes (transposase-nucleic acid complexes) are available, and we use these to describe the basics of their mechanisms. The DD(E\/D) group, in addition to being the largest and most common among all DNA transposases, is the one whose members have been used for a wide variety of genomic applications. Therefore, a second focus of the article is to provide a nonexhaustive overview of transposon applications. Although several non-transposon-based approaches to site-directed genome modifications have emerged in the past decade, transposon-based applications are highly relevant when integration specificity is not sought. In fact, for many applications, the almost-perfect randomness and high frequency of integration make transposon-based approaches indispensable.","1595":"Water is an essential participant in the stability, structure, dynamics, and function of proteins and other biomolecules. Thermodynamically, changes in the aqueous environment affect the stability of biomolecules. Structurally, water participates chemically in the catalytic function of proteins and nucleic acids and physically in the collapse of the protein chain during folding through hydrophobic collapse and mediates binding through the hydrogen bond in complex formation. Water is a partner that slaves the dynamics of proteins, and water interaction with proteins affect their dynamics. Here we provide a review of the experimental and computational advances over the past decade in understanding the role of water in the dynamics, structure, and function of proteins. We focus on the combination of X-ray and neutron crystallography, NMR, terahertz spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and computer simulations to reveal how water assist proteins in their function.

Possible future research directions are also discussed.","1597":"Almost 50 years have passed from the first computer simulations of water, and a large number of molecular models have been proposed since then to elucidate the unique behavior of water across different phases. In this article, we review the recent progress in the development of analytical potential energy functions that aim at correctly representing many-body effects. Starting from the many-body expansion of the interaction energy, specific focus is on different classes of potential energy functions built upon a hierarchy of approximations and on their ability to accurately reproduce reference data obtained from state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements. We show that most recent potential energy functions, which include explicit short-range representations of two-body and three-body effects along with a physically correct description of many-body effects at all distances, predict the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase with unprecedented accuracy, thus opening the door to the long-sought \"universal model\" capable of describing the behavior of water under different conditions and in different environments.","1598":"Natural sunlight offers a cost-efficient and sustainable energy source for photochemical reactions. In contrast to the lengthy and small-scale \"flask in the sun\" procedures of the past, modern solar concentrator systems nowadays significantly shorten reaction times and enable technical-scale operations. After a brief historical introduction, this review presents the most important solar reactor types and their successful application in preparative solar syntheses. The examples demonstrate that solar manufacturing of fine chemicals is technically feasible and environmentally sustainable. After over 100 years, Ciamician's prophetic vision of \"the photochemistry of the future\" as a clean and green manufacturing methodology has yet to be realized. At the same time, his warning \"for nature is not in a hurry but mankind is\" is still valid today.

As tools they find increasing use for the generation and systematic modification of genomes in a plethora of organisms. If applied in host organisms, they enable precise DNA cleavage and ligation without the gain or loss of nucleotides. Criteria directing the choice of the most appropriate T-SSR system for genetic engineering include that, whenever possible, the recombinase should act independent of cofactors and that the target sequences should be long enough to be unique in a given genome. This review is focused on recent advancements in our mechanistic understanding of simple T-SSRs and their application in developmental and synthetic biology, as well as in biomedical research.","1604":"Copper-doped semiconductors are classic phosphor materials that have been used in a variety of applications for many decades. Colloidal copper-doped semiconductor nanocrystals have recently attracted a great deal of interest because they combine the solution processability and spectral tunability of colloidal nanocrystals with the unique photoluminescence properties of copper-doped semiconductor phosphors. Although ternary and quaternary semiconductors containing copper, such as CuInS2 and Cu2ZnSnS4, have been studied primarily in the context of their photovoltaic applications, when synthesized as colloidal nanocrystals, these materials have photoluminescence properties that are remarkably similar to those of copper-doped semiconductor nanocrystals. This review focuses on the luminescent properties of colloidal copper-doped, copper-based, and related copper-containing semiconductor nanocrystals. Fundamental investigations into the luminescence of copper-containing colloidal nanocrystals are reviewed in the context of the well-established luminescence mechanisms of bulk copper-doped semiconductors and copper(I) molecular coordination complexes.

After a brief introduction to the definition and classification of the hollow micro-\/nanostructures, we discuss various synthetic strategies that can be grouped into three major categories, including hard templating, soft templating, and self-templating synthesis. For both hard and soft templating strategies, we focus on how different types of templates are generated and then used for creating hollow structures. At the end of each section, the structural and morphological control over the product is discussed.

In these studies, interactions between ions, and between ions and water, are investigated with relatively novel approaches, including dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, far-infrared (terahertz) absorption spectroscopy, femtosecond mid-infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray spectroscopy and scattering, as well as molecular dynamics simulation methods. With these methods, it is found that ion pairing is not a rare phenomenon only occurring for very particular, strongly interacting cations and anions. Instead, for many salt solutions and their interfaces, the measured and calculated structure and dynamics reveal the presence of a distinct concentration of contact ion pairs (CIPs), solvent shared ion pairs (SIPs), and solvent-separated ion pairs (2SIPs). We discuss the importance of specific ion-pairing interactions between cations like Li(+) and Na(+) and anionic carboxylate and phosphate groups for the structure and functioning of large (bio)molecular systems.","1607":"A complete review of the published data on the mixing enthalpies of mixtures containing ionic liquids, measured directly using calorimetric techniques, is presented in this paper. The field of ionic liquids is very active and a number of research groups in the world are dealing with different applications of these fluids in the fields of chemistry, chemical engineering, energy, gas storage and separation or materials science. In all these fields, the knowledge of the energetics of mixing is capital both to understand the interactions between these fluids and the different substrates and also to establish the energy and environmental cost of possible applications. Due to the relative novelty of the field, the published data is sometimes controversial and recent reviews are fragmentary and do not represent a set of reliable data. This fact can be attributed to different reasons: (i) difficulties in controlling the purity and stability of the ionic liquid samples; (ii) availability of accurate experimental techniques, appropriate for the measurement of viscous, charged, complex fluids; and (iii) choice of an appropriate clear thermodynamic formalism to be used by an interdisciplinary scientific community. In this paper, we address all these points and propose a critical review of the published data, advise on the most appropriate apparatus and experimental procedure to measure this type of physical-chemical data in ionic liquids as well as the way to treat the information obtained by an appropriate thermodynamic formalism.","1608":null,"1609":"Contaminated soil and water pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystem. For the treatment of industrial effluents or minimizing their detrimental effects, preventive and remedial approaches must be adopted prior to the occurrence of any severe environmental, health, or safety hazard. Conventional treatment methods of wastewater are insufficient, complicated, and expensive. Therefore, a method that could use environmentally friendly surfactants for the simultaneous removal of both organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater is deemed a smart approach. Surfactants containing potential donor ligands can coordinate with metal ions, and thus such compounds can be used for the removal of toxic metals and organometallic compounds from aqueous systems. Surfactants form host-guest complexes with the hydrophobic contaminants of water and soil by a mechanism involving the encapsulation of hydrophobes into the self-assembled aggregates (micelles) of surfactants. However, because undefined amounts of surfactants may be released into the aqueous systems, attention must be paid to their own environmental risks as well. Moreover, surfactant remediation methods must be carefully analyzed in the laboratory before field implementation. The use of biosurfactants is the best choice for the removal of water toxins as such surfactants are associated with the characteristics of biodegradability, versatility, recovery, and reuse. This Review is focused on the currently employed surfactant-based soil and wastewater treatment technologies owing to their critical role in the implementation of certain solutions for controlling pollution level, which is necessary to protect human health and ensure the quality standard of the aquatic environment.","1610":"This Review describes singlet oxygen ((1)O2) in the organic synthesis of targets on possible (1)O2 biosynthetic routes.

The input of energy provided by light thus offers a means to produce strained and unique target compounds that cannot be assembled using thermal protocols.

Synthetic designs based on photochemical transformations have the potential to afford complex polycyclic carbon skeletons with impressive efficiency, which are of high value in total synthesis.","1612":"Cerium dioxide (CeO2, ceria) is becoming an ubiquitous constituent in catalytic systems for a variety of applications. 2016 sees the 40(th) anniversary since ceria was first employed by Ford Motor Company as an oxygen storage component in car converters, to become in the years since its inception an irreplaceable component in three-way catalysts (TWCs). Apart from this well-established use, ceria is looming as a catalyst component for a wide range of catalytic applications. For some of these, such as fuel cells, CeO2-based materials have almost reached the market stage, while for some other catalytic reactions, such as reforming processes, photocatalysis, water-gas shift reaction, thermochemical water splitting, and organic reactions, ceria is emerging as a unique material, holding great promise for future market breakthroughs. While much knowledge about the fundamental characteristics of CeO2-based materials has already been acquired, new characterization techniques and powerful theoretical methods are deepening our understanding of these materials, helping us to predict their behavior and application potential.

Such advances have been driven not only by new theoretical models and pharmacological applications of allostery, but also by progress in the experimental approaches designed to map allosteric sites and transitions. Among these techniques, NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here, we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions. The picture of the allosteric \"NMR toolbox\" is provided starting from one of the simplest models of allostery (i.e., the four-state thermodynamic cycle) and continuing to more complex multistate mechanisms. We also review how such an \"NMR toolbox\" has assisted the elucidation of the allosteric molecular basis for disease-related mutations and the discovery of novel leads for allosteric drugs.

This review covers the principles, advantages, and drawbacks of passive and active targeting based on various polymer and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle carriers with drug attached by both covalent and noncovalent pathways. Attention is devoted to the tailored conjugation of targeting ligands (e.g., enzymes, antibodies, peptides) to drug carrier systems. Similarly, the approaches toward controlled drug release are discussed. Various polymer-drug conjugates based, for example, on polyethylene glycol (PEG), N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA), polymeric micelles, and nanoparticle carriers are explored with respect to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME scheme) of administrated drug. Design and structure of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) and condensed magnetic clusters are classified according to the mechanism of noncovalent drug loading involving hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, coordination chemistry, and encapsulation in porous materials. Principles of covalent conjugation of drugs with SPIONs including thermo- and pH-degradable bonds, amide linkage, redox-cleavable bonds, and enzymatically-cleavable bonds are also thoroughly described.

This Review provides an overview of reported methods for enantioselective and asymmetric syntheses of cyclopentenones, including chemical and enzymatic resolution, asymmetric synthesis via Pauson-Khand reaction, Nazarov cyclization and organocatalyzed reactions, asymmetric functionalization of the existing cyclopentenone unit, and functionalization of chiral building blocks.","1619":"The interstellar medium is characterized by a rich and diverse chemistry. Many of its complex organic molecules are proposed to form through radical chemistry in icy grain mantles. Radicals form readily when interstellar ices (composed of water and other volatiles) are exposed to UV photons and other sources of dissociative radiation, and if sufficiently mobile the radicals can react to form larger, more complex molecules. The resulting complex organic molecules (COMs) accompany star and planet formation and may eventually seed the origins of life on nascent planets. Experiments of increasing sophistication have demonstrated that known interstellar COMs as well as the prebiotically interesting amino acids can form through ice photochemistry. We review these experiments and discuss the qualitative and quantitative kinetic and mechanistic constraints they have provided. We finally compare the effects of UV radiation with those of three other potential sources of radical production and chemistry in interstellar ices: electrons, ions, and X-rays.

A broad range of water investigations are addressed, from conventional infrared and Raman spectroscopy to femtosecond pump-probe, photon-echo, optical Kerr effect, sum-frequency generation, and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic studies. Additionally, we discuss novel approaches, such as two-dimensional sum-frequency generation, three-dimensional infrared, and two-dimensional Raman terahertz spectroscopy. By comparison of the complementary aspects probed by various linear and nonlinear spectroscopic techniques, a coherent picture of water dynamics and energetics emerges.

Over the past years, medicinal chemistry approaches from a kinetic perspective have been increasingly applied to G protein-coupled receptors including the adenosine receptors (AR), which are involved in a plethora of physiological and pathological conditions. The study of ligand-AR binding kinetics offers room for detailed structure-kinetics relationships next to more traditional structure-activity relationships. Their combination may facilitate the triage of candidate compounds in hit-to-lead campaigns. Furthermore, kinetic studies also help in understanding AR allosterism. Allosteric modulation may yield a change in the activity and conformation of a receptor resulting from the binding of a compound at a site distinct from where the endogenous agonist adenosine binds. Hence, in this Review, we summarize available data and evidence for the binding kinetics of orthosteric and allosteric AR ligands.

Colorimetric and fluorescent chemosensors based on organic molecular species have been demonstrated to be effective for the detection of various ions and possess the significant advantages of low cost, high sensitivity, and convenient implementation. Of the available classes of organic molecules, porphyrin analogues possess inherently many advantageous features, making them suitable for the design of ion chemosensors, with the targeted sensing behavior achieved and easily modulated based on their following characteristics: (1) NH moieties properly disposed for binding of anions through cooperative hydrogen-bonding interactions; (2) multiple pyrrolic N atoms or other heteroatoms for selectively chelating metal ions; (3) variability of macrocycle size and peripheral substitution for modulation of ion selectivity and sensitivity; and (4) tunable near-infrared emission and good biocompatibility.

Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5%. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).","1626":null,"1627":"This review is a comprehensive survey of the last 10 years of research on ammonia-borane and amine-borane dehydrogenation mediated by complex metal hydrides (CMHs), within the broader context of chemical hydrogen storage.

To date, the discovery of allosteric binding sites and lead compounds has been mostly serendipitous, achieved through high-throughput screening. Over the past decade, structural data has become more readily available for larger protein systems and more membrane protein classes (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels), which are common allosteric drug targets. In parallel, improved simulation methods now provide better atomistic understanding of the protein dynamics and cooperative motions that are critical to allosteric mechanisms. As a result of these advances, the field of predictive allosteric drug development is now on the cusp of a new era of rational structure-based computational methods. Here, we review algorithms that predict allosteric sites based on sequence data and molecular dynamics simulations, describe tools that assess the druggability of these pockets, and discuss how Markov state models and topology analyses provide insight into the relationship between protein dynamics and allosteric drug binding. In each section, we first provide an overview of the various method classes before describing relevant algorithms and software packages.","1630":"Semiempirical (SE) methods can be derived from either Hartree-Fock or density functional theory by applying systematic approximations, leading to efficient computational schemes that are several orders of magnitude faster than ab initio calculations. Such numerical efficiency, in combination with modern computational facilities and linear scaling algorithms, allows application of SE methods to very large molecular systems with extensive conformational sampling. To reliably model the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of biological and other soft matter systems, however, good accuracy for the description of noncovalent interactions is required. In this review, we analyze popular SE approaches in terms of their ability to model noncovalent interactions, especially in the context of describing biomolecules, water solution, and organic materials. We discuss the most significant errors and proposed correction schemes, and we review their performance using standard test sets of molecular systems for quantum chemical methods and several recent applications. The general goal is to highlight both the value and limitations of SE methods and stimulate further developments that allow them to effectively complement ab initio methods in the analysis of complex molecular systems.","1631":null,"1632":"The present review offers an overview of the current approaches for the photochemical and photocatalytic generation of reactive intermediates and their application in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.

Although solvation dynamics of interfacial or biological water has been studied extensively in aqueous solution, the results are generally averaged over several solvation layers and the motion of individual solvent molecules is difficult to capture. This review describes the development and application of a new experimental approach, namely, picosecond time-resolved pump-probe infrared spectroscopy of size- and isomer-selected aromatic clusters, in which for the first time the dynamics of a single individual solvent molecule can be followed in real time. The intermolecular isomerization reaction is triggered by resonant photoionization (pump), and infrared photodissociation (probe) at variable delay generates the spectroscopic signature of salient properties of the reaction, including rates, yields, pathways, branching ratios of competing reactions, existence of reaction intermediates, occurrence of back reactions, and time scales of energy relaxation processes. It is shown that this relevant information can reliably be decoded from the experimental spectra by sophisticated molecular dynamics simulations.

Many such cements are ideally suited to specialist applications in precast construction, road repair, and other fields including nuclear waste immobilization. The majority of MgO-based cements are more costly to produce than Portland cement because of the relatively high cost of reactive sources of MgO and do not have a sufficiently high internal pH to passivate mild steel reinforcing bars. This precludes MgO-based cements from providing a large-scale replacement for Portland cement in the production of steel-reinforced concretes for civil engineering applications, despite the potential for CO2 emissions reductions offered by some such systems.

Plasma technologies are predominantly used in two different ways: for the treatment of polymer substrates by a reactive or inert gas aiming at a specific surface functionalization or for the synthesis of a plasma polymer with a unique set of properties from an organic or mixed organic-inorganic precursor. Plasma polymer films (PPFs), often deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), currently attract a great deal of attention. Such films are widely used in various fields for the coating of solid substrates, including membranes, semiconductors, metals, textiles, and polymers, because of a combination of interesting properties such as excellent adhesion, highly cross-linked structures, and the possibility of tuning properties by simply varying the precursor and\/or the synthesis parameters. Among the many appealing features of plasma-synthesized and -treated polymers, a highly reactive surface, rich in free radicals arising from deposition\/treatment specifics, offers a particular advantage. When handled carefully, these reactive free radicals open doors to the controllable surface functionalization of materials without affecting their bulk properties.

Another reason to restrict the size of water domains by different types of geometrical confinements has been the possibility to study the structural and dynamical behavior of water in the deeply supercooled regime (e.g., 150-230 K at ambient pressure), where bulk water immediately crystallizes to ice. In this paper we give a short review of studies with this particular goal. However, from these studies it is also clear that the interpretations of the experimental data are far from evident. Therefore, we present three main interpretations to explain the experimental data, and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately, none of the proposed scenarios is able to predict all the observations for supercooled and glassy bulk water, indicating that either the structural and dynamical alterations of confined water are too severe to make predictions for bulk water or the differences in how the studied water has been prepared (applied cooling rate, resulting density of the water, etc.) are too large for direct and quantitative comparisons.","1662":"The applications of copper (Cu) and Cu-based nanoparticles, which are based on the earth-abundant and inexpensive copper metal, have generated a great deal of interest in recent years, especially in the field of catalysis.

The focus of this Review will be predominantly on the design principles around the construction of temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSL) and their use in combination with external local hyperthermia to achieve heat-triggered drug release. The emphasis lies on the chemical components synthesized and incorporated in the design and engineering of TSL. We conclude that the development of TSL with ultrafast drug release capabilities needs to progress in parallel with vesicle pharmacokinetic profiling, imaging, and monitoring capacity and technologies for accurate temperature elevation and control. The development of heat-triggered liposome systems offer the greatest opportunity for clinical translation of the next generation, nanoscale \"smart\" vesicle systems of enhanced functionality, following from the successful legacy and rich clinical history from multiple earlier liposome technologies.

Quantum mechanical studies have played a key role in interpretating the results of modern time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, and in elucidating the main photoactivated reactive paths. This review provides a concise, complete picture of the computational studies carried out, approximately, in the past decade. We start with an overview of the photophysics of the nucleobases in the gas phase and in solution. We discuss the proposed mechanisms for ultrafast decay to the ground state, that involve conical intersections, consider the role of triplet states, and analyze how the solvent modulates the photophysics. Then we move to larger systems, from dinucleotides to single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides. We focus on the possible role of charge transfer and delocalized or excitonic states in the photophysics of these systems and discuss the main photochemical paths.

The measurement and understanding of their energy levels is key to scientific and technological progress. Here we review how the confined electronic orbitals and related energy levels of individual semiconductor quantum dots have been measured by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. These techniques were originally developed for flat conducting surfaces, but they have been adapted to investigate the atomic and electronic structure of semiconductor quantum dots. We compare the results obtained on colloidal quantum dots with those on comparable solid-state ones. We also compare the results obtained with scanning tunneling spectroscopy with those of optical spectroscopy. The first three sections provide an introduction to colloidal quantum dots, and a theoretical basis to be able to understand tunneling spectroscopy on dots attached to a conducting surface. In sections 4 and 5 , we review the work performed on lead-chalcogenide nanocrystals and on colloidal quantum dots and rods of II-VI compounds, respectively.

In this review, we offer two case studies that demonstrate the possibilities of these versatile and reliable synthetic tools, namely, in the field of polymer science as well as in more recently emerging applications in the field of click chemistry. As the general use of triazolinediones has always been hampered by the limited commercial and synthetic availability of such reagents, we also offer a review of the available TAD reagents, together with a detailed discussion of their synthesis and reactivity. This review thus aims to serve as a practical guide for researchers that are interested in exploiting and further developing the exceptional click-like reactivity of triazolinediones in various applications. ","1671":"Allosteric transition, defined as conformational changes induced by ligand binding, is one of the fundamental properties of proteins. Allostery has been observed and characterized in many proteins, and has been recently utilized to control protein function via regulation of protein activity. Here, we review the physical and evolutionary origin of protein allostery, as well as its importance to protein regulation, drug discovery, and biological processes in living systems. We describe recently developed approaches to identify allosteric pathways, connected sets of pairwise interactions that are responsible for propagation of conformational change from the ligand-binding site to a distal functional site. We then present experimental and computational protein engineering approaches for control of protein function by modulation of allosteric sites. As an example of application of these approaches, we describe a synergistic computational and experimental approach to rescue the cystic-fibrosis-associated protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which upon deletion of a single residue misfolds and causes disease. This example demonstrates the power of allosteric manipulation in proteins to both elucidate mechanisms of molecular function and to develop therapeutic strategies that rescue those functions. Allosteric control of proteins provides a tool to shine a light on the complex cascades of cellular processes and facilitate unprecedented interrogation of biological systems.","1672":"Solute transport across cell membranes is ubiquitous in biology as an essential physiological process. Secondary active transporters couple the unfavorable process of solute transport against its concentration gradient to the energetically favorable transport of one or several ions. The study of such transporters over several decades indicates that their function involves complex allosteric mechanisms that are progressively being revealed in atomistic detail. We focus on two well-characterized sodium-coupled symporters: the bacterial amino acid transporter LeuT, which is the prototype for the \"gated pore\" mechanism in the mammalian synaptic monoamine transporters, and the archaeal GltPh, which is the prototype for the \"elevator\" mechanism in the mammalian excitatory amino acid transporters. We present the evidence for the role of allostery in the context of a quantitative formalism that can reconcile biochemical and biophysical data and thereby connects directly to recent insights into the molecular structure and dynamics of these proteins. We demonstrate that, while the structures and mechanisms of these transporters are very different, the available data suggest a common role of specific models of allostery in their functions. We argue that such allosteric mechanisms appear essential not only for sodium-coupled symport in general but also for the function of other types of molecular machines in the membrane.","1673":"Among the various postsynthesis treatments of colloidal nanocrystals that have been developed to date, transformations by cation exchange have recently emerged as an extremely versatile tool that has given access to a wide variety of materials and nanostructures. One notable example in this direction is represented by partial cation exchange, by which preformed nanocrystals can be either transformed to alloy nanocrystals or to various types of nanoheterostructures possessing core\/shell, segmented, or striped architectures. In this review, we provide an up to date overview of the complex colloidal nanostructures that could be prepared so far by cation exchange. At the same time, the review gives an account of the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing these types of reactions, as they are currently understood, and outlines the main open issues and possible future developments in the field. ","1674":"Proteins are dynamic entities that undergo a plethora of conformational changes that may take place on a wide range of time scales. These changes can be as small as the rotation of one or a few side-chain dihedral angles or involve concerted motions in larger portions of the three-dimensional structure; both kinds of motions can be important for biological function and allostery. It is becoming increasingly evident that \"connector regions\" are important components of the dynamic personality of protein structures. These regions may be either disordered loops, i.e., poorly structured regions connecting secondary structural elements, or linkers that connect entire protein domains. Experimental and computational studies have, however, revealed that these regions are not mere connectors, and their role in allostery and conformational changes has been emerging in the last few decades. Here we provide a detailed overview of the structural properties and classification of loops and linkers, as well as a discussion of the main computational methods employed to investigate their function and dynamical properties. We also describe their importance for protein dynamics and allostery using as examples key proteins in cellular biology and human diseases such as kinases, ubiquitinating enzymes, and transcription factors.","1675":"In this review we focus on the catalytic removal of a series of N-containing exhaust gases with various valences, including nitriles (HCN, CH3CN, and C2H3CN), ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxides (NO(x)), which can cause some serious environmental problems, such as acid rain, haze weather, global warming, and even death.

Although the industrial production of these chemicals started over 100 years ago, there are still factors that limit the energy efficiencies of the processes. This review focuses on the unwanted production of oxygen gas, which decreases the charge yield by up to 5%. Understanding the factors that control the rate of oxygen production requires understanding of both chemical reactions occurring in the electrolyte, as well as surface reactions occurring on the anodes. The dominant anode material used in chlorate and chlor-alkali production is the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), Ti coated by a mixed oxide of RuO2 and TiO2. Although the selectivity for chlorine evolution on DSA is high, the fundamental reasons for this high selectivity are just now becoming elucidated. This review summarizes the research, since the early 1900s until today, concerning the selectivity between chlorine and oxygen evolution in chlorate and chlor-alkali production. It covers experimental as well as theoretical studies and highlights the relationships between process conditions, electrolyte composition, the material properties of the anode, and the selectivity for oxygen formation. ","1682":"The functions of many proteins are regulated through allostery, whereby effector binding at a distal site changes the functional activity (e.g., substrate binding affinity or catalytic efficiency) at the active site. Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions. Here we assess the roles of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation. Two cases are highlighted where NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation have been used as complementary approaches to identify residues possibly involved in allosteric communication. Perspectives on contentious issues, for example, the relationship between picosecond-nanosecond local and microsecond-millisecond conformational exchange dynamics, are presented.","1683":null,"1684":"The platinum drugs, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, prevail in the treatment of cancer, but new platinum agents have been very slow to enter the clinic.

Separately, the Black\/Leff operational model has furnished an extremely valuable method of quantifying drug agonism. In the past few years, incorporation of the basic allosteric nature of 7TMRs has led to additional useful models of functional receptor allosteric mechanisms; these models yield valuable methods for quantifying allosteric effects.

A similar central dogma for guiding and unifying nanoscience has been missing. This review traces the origins, evolution, and current status of such a critical nanoperiodic concept\/framework for defining and unifying nanoscience. Based on parallel efforts and a mutual consensus now shared by both chemists and physicists, a nanoperiodic\/systematic framework concept has emerged. This concept is based on the well-documented existence of discrete, nanoscale collections of traditional inorganic\/organic atoms referred to as hard and soft superatoms (i.e., nanoelement categories). These nanometric entities are widely recognized to exhibit nanoscale atom mimicry features reminiscent of traditional picoscale atoms. All unique superatom\/nanoelement physicochemical features are derived from quantized structural control defined by six critical nanoscale design parameters (CNDPs), namely, size, shape, surface chemistry, flexibility\/rigidity, architecture, and elemental composition. These CNDPs determine all intrinsic superatom properties, their combining behavior to form stoichiometric nanocompounds\/assemblies as well as to exhibit nanoperiodic properties leading to new nanoperiodic rules and predictive Mendeleev-like nanoperiodic tables, and they portend possible extension of these principles to larger quantized building blocks including meta-atoms.

We argue that allostery can be rationalized in terms of pathways of residues that efficiently transmit energy between different binding sites. We then provide examples that show how this picture could account for most of the observed data, since energy flow may be manifested as changes in both structure and dynamics. We conclude by acknowledging that the proposed view is still a simplification and should not be taken as a rigorous model of allosteric communication in proteins. Nevertheless, simple pictures like this can go a long way in improving our understanding of many complex phenomena observed in nature.","1715":"","1716":"","1717":"Solving structures or structural ensembles of large macromolecular systems in solution poses a challenging problem. While NMR provides structural information at atomic resolution, increased spectral complexity, chemical shift overlap, and short transverse relaxation times (associated with slow tumbling) render application of the usual techniques that have been so successful for medium sized systems (&lt;50 kDa) difficult. Solution X-ray scattering, on the other hand, is not limited by molecular weight but only provides low resolution structural information related to the overall shape and size of the system under investigation. Here we review how combining atomic resolution structures of smaller domains with sparse experimental data afforded by NMR residual dipolar couplings (which yield both orientational and shape information) and solution X-ray scattering data in rigid-body simulated annealing calculations provides a powerful approach for investigating the structural aspects of conformational dynamics in large multidomain proteins. The application of this hybrid methodology is illustrated for the 128 kDa dimer of bacterial Enzyme I which exists in a variety of open and closed states that are sampled at various points in the catalytic cycles, and for the capsid protein of the human immunodeficiency virus.","1718":"Allostery is a ubiquitous biological regulatory process in which distant binding sites within a protein or enzyme are functionally and thermodynamically coupled. Allosteric interactions play essential roles in many enzymological mechanisms, often facilitating formation of enzyme-substrate complexes and\/or product release. Thus, elucidating the forces that drive allostery is critical to understanding the complex transformations of biomolecules. Currently, a number of models exist to describe allosteric behavior, taking into account energetics as well as conformational rearrangements and fluctuations. In the following Review, we discuss the use of solution NMR techniques designed to probe allosteric mechanisms in enzymes. NMR spectroscopy is unequaled in its ability to detect structural and dynamical changes in biomolecules, and the case studies presented herein demonstrate the range of insights to be gained from this valuable method. We also provide a detailed technical discussion of several specialized NMR experiments that are ideally suited for the study of enzymatic allostery.","1719":"Multidisciplinary research at the forefront of the field of hybrid materials has paved the way to the development of endless examples of smart devices. One appealing concept in this fertile field is related to the design of gated materials. These are constructed for finely tuning the delivery of chemical or biochemical species from voids of porous supports to a solution in response to predefined stimuli. Such gated materials are composed mainly of two subunits: (i) a porous inorganic support in which a cargo is loaded and (ii) certain molecular or supramolecular entities, generally grafted onto the external surface, which can control mass transport from pores. On the basis of this concept, a large number of imaginative examples have been developed. This review intends to be a comprehensive analysis of papers published until 2014 on hybrid mesoporous gated materials. The molecules used as gates, the opening mechanisms, and controlled release behavior are detailed. We hope this review will not only help researchers who work in this field but also may open the minds of related ones to develop new advances in this fertile research area.

Ever-increasing demands on conversion and energy efficiencies are a strong driving force for the development of alternative approaches. Similarly, synthesis of several functional materials (such as nanowires and nanotubes) demands special processing conditions. Plasma catalysis provides such an alternative, where the catalytic process is complemented by the use of plasmas that activate the source gas. This combination is often observed to result in a synergy between plasma and catalyst. This Review introduces the current state-of-the-art in plasma catalysis, including numerous examples where plasma catalysis has demonstrated its benefits or shows future potential, including CO2 conversion, hydrocarbon reforming, synthesis of nanomaterials, ammonia production, and abatement of toxic waste gases.

The basic parameter that controls the degree of distortion is the metal-donor atom bond distance that induces nonideal bond angles due to the rigidity of the ligands. Thus, the degree of distortion within each family of complexes depends on the atomic size, on which the high- or low-spin state has a large effect. Special attention is therefore paid to several spin-crossover systems and to the enhanced distortions that go along with the transition from low- to high-spin state affected by temperature, light, or pressure. Several families of complexes show deviations from the expected distortion pathways in the high-spin state that can be associated to the onset of intermolecular interactions such as secondary coordination of counterions or solvent molecules. Also, significant displacement of counterions in an extended solid may result from the changes in metal-ligand bond distances when ligands are involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

this review, we have examined the different models for polymer-electrolyte fuel cells operating with hydrogen. The major focus has been on transport of the various species within the fuel cell. The different regions of the fuel cell were examined, and their modeling methodologies and equations were elucidated. In particular, the 1-D fuel-cell sandwich was discussed thoroughly because it is the most important part of the fuel-cell assembly. Models that included other effects such as temperature gradients and transport in other directions besides through the fuel-cell sandwich were also discussed. Models were not directly compared to each other; instead they were broken down into their constitutive parts. The reason for this is that validation of the models is usually accomplished by comparison of simulation to experimental polarization data (e.g., Figure 3). However, other data can also be used such as the net flux of water through the membrane. In fitting these data, the models vary not only in their complexity and treatments but also in their number and kind of fitting parameters. This is one reason it is hard to justify one approach over another by just looking at the modeling results. In general, it seems reasonable that the more complex models, which are based on physical arguments and do not contain many fitting parameters, are perhaps closest to reality. Of course, this assumes that they fit the experimental data and observations. This last point has been overlooked in the validation of many models. For example, a model may fit the data very well for certain operating conditions, but if it does not at least predict the correct trend when one of those conditions is changed, then the model is shown to be valid only within a certain operating range. This review has highlighted the important effects that should be modeled. These include two-phase flow of liquid water and gas in the fuel-cell sandwich, a robust membrane model that accounts for the different membrane transport modes, nonisothermal effects, especially in the directions perpendicular to the sandwich, and multidimensional effects such as changing gas composition along the channel, among others. For any model, a balance must be struck between the complexity required to describe the physical reality and the additional costs of such complexity. In other words, while more complex models more accurately describe the physics of the transport processes, they are more computationally costly and may have so many unknown parameters that their results are not as meaningful. Hopefully, this review has shown and broken down for the reader the vast complexities of transport within polymer-electrolyte fuel cells and the various ways they have been and can be modeled.","3978":"","3979":"","3980":"","3981":"","3982":"","3983":"","3984":"","3985":"The ideal battery separator would be infinitesimally thin, offer no resistance to ionic transport in electrolytes, provide infinite resistance to electronic conductivity for isolation of electrodes, be highly tortuous to prevent dendritic growths, and be inert to chemical reactions. Unfortunately, in the real world the ideal case does not exist. Real world separators are electronically insulating membranes whose ionic resistivity is brought to the desired range by manipulating the membranes thickness and porosity. It is clear that no single separator satisfies all the needs of battery designers, and compromises have to be made. It is ultimately the application that decides which separator is most suitable. We hope that this paper will be a useful tool and will help the battery manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate separators for their batteries and respective applications. The information provided is purely technical and does not include other very important parameters, such as cost of production, availability, and long-term stability. There has been a continued demand for thinner battery separators to increase battery power and capacity. This has been especially true for lithiumion batteries used in portable electronics. However, it is very important to ensure the continued safety of batteries, and this is where the role of the separator is greatest. Thus, it is essential to optimize all the components of battery to improve the performance while maintaining the safety of these cells. Separator manufacturers should work along with the battery manufacturers to create the next generation of batteries with increased reliability and performance, but always keeping safety in mind. This paper has attempted to present a comprehensive review of literature on separators used in various batteries. It is evident that a wide variety of separators are available and that they are critical components in batteries. In many cases, the separator is one of the major factors limiting the life and\/or performance of batteries. Consequently, development of new improved separators would be very beneficial for the advanced high capacity batteries.","3986":"","3987":"","3988":"Electrochemical energy conversion devices are pervasive in our daily lives.

oxidation catalysts have gained much attention in recent years. The reason for this surge in activity is 2-fold: On one hand, a number of such catalysts has become readily accessible; on the other hand, such catalysts are quite resistant toward self-oxidation and compatible under aerobic and aqueous reaction conditions. In this review, we have focused on five nonmetal catalytic systems which have attained prominence in the oxidation field in view of their efficacy and their potential for future development; stoichiometric cases have been mentioned to provide overview and scope. Such nonmetal oxidation catalysts include the alpha-halo carbonyl compounds 1, ketones 2, imines 3, iminium salts 4, and nitroxyl radicals 5. In combination with a suitable oxygen source (H2O2, KHSO5, NaOCl), these catalysts serve as precursors to the corresponding oxidants, namely, the perhydrates I, dioxiranes II, oxaziridines III, oxaziridinium ions IV, and finally oxoammonium ions V. A few of the salient features about these nonmetal, catalytic systems shall be reiterated in this summary. The first class entails the alpha-halo ketones, which catalyze the oxidation of a variety of organic substrates [figure: see text] by hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen source. The perhydrates I, formed in situ by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the alpha-halo ketones, are quite strong electrophilic oxidants and expectedly transfer an oxygen atom to diverse nucleophilic acceptors. Thus, alpha-halo ketones have been successfully employed for catalytic epoxidation, heteroatom (S, N) oxidation, and arene oxidation. Although high diastereoselectivities have been achieved by these nonmetal catalysts, no enantioselective epoxidation and sulfoxidation have so far been reported. Consequently, it is anticipated that catalytic oxidations by perhydrates hold promise for further development, especially, and should ways be found to transfer the oxygen atom enantioselectively. The second class, namely, the dioxiranes, has been extensively used during the last two decades as a convenient oxidant in organic synthesis. These powerful and versatile oxidizing agents are readily available from the appropriate ketones by their treatment [figure: see text] with potassium monoperoxysulfate. The oxidations may be performed either under stoichiometric or catalytic conditions; the latter mode of operation is featured in this review. In this case, a variety of structurally diverse ketones have been shown to catalyze the dioxirane-mediated epoxidation of alkenes by monoperoxysulfate as the oxygen source. By employing chiral ketones, highly enantioselective (up to 99% ee) epoxidations have been developed, of which the sugar-based ketones are so far the most effective. Reports on catalytic oxidations by dioxiranes other than epoxidations are scarce; nevertheless, fructose-derived ketones have been successfully employed as catalysts for the enantioselective CH oxidation in vic diols to afford the corresponding optically active alpha-hydroxy ketones. To date, no catalytic asymmetric sulfoxidations by dioxiranes appear to have been documented in the literature, an area of catalytic dioxirane chemistry that merits attention. A third class is the imines; their reaction with hydrogen peroxide or monoperoxysulfate affords oxaziridines. These relatively weak electrophilic oxidants only manage to oxidize electron-rich substrates such as enolates, silyl enol ethers, sulfides, selenides, and amines; however, the epoxidation of alkenes has been achieved with activated oxaziridines produced from perfluorinated imines. Most of the oxidations by in-situ-generated oxaziridines have been performed stoichiometrically, with the exception of sulfoxidations. When chiral imines are used as catalysts, optically active sulfoxides are obtained in good ee values, a catalytic asymmetric oxidation by oxaziridines that merits further exploration. The fourth class is made up by the iminium ions, which with monoperoxysulfate lead to the corresponding oxaziridinium ions, structurally similar to the above oxaziridine oxidants except they possess a much more strongly electrophilic oxygen atom due to the positively charged ammonium functionality. Thus, oxaziridinium ions effectively execute besides sulfoxidation and amine oxidation the epoxidation of alkenes under catalytic conditions. As expected, chiral iminium salts catalyze asymmetric epoxidations; however, only moderate enantioselectivities have been obtained so far. Although asymmetric sulfoxidation has been achieved by using stoichiometric amounts of isolated optically active oxaziridinium salts, iminium-ion-catalyzed asymmetric sulf-oxidations have not been reported to date, which offers attractive opportunities for further work. The fifth and final class of nonmetal catalysts concerns the stable nitroxyl-radical derivatives such as TEMPO, which react with the common oxidizing agents (sodium hypochlorite, monoperoxysulfate, peracids) to generate oxoammonium ions. The latter are strong oxidants that chemoselectively and efficiently perform the CH oxidation in alcohols to produce carbonyl compounds rather than engage in the transfer of their oxygen atom to the substrate. Consequently, oxoammonium ions behave quite distinctly compared to the previous four classes of oxidants in that their catalytic activity entails formally a dehydrogenation, one of the few effective nonmetal-based catalytic transformations of alcohols to carbonyl products. Since less than 1 mol% of nitroxyl radical is required to catalyze the alcohol oxidation by the inexpensive sodium hypochlorite as primary oxidant under mild reaction conditions, this catalytic process holds much promise for future practical applications.","4642":"","4643":"PdX2L2\/L\/HA (A = weakly coordinating anion, L = phosphine) complexes are active catalysts in the hydroesterification of alkenes, alkynes, and conjugated dienes. Shell, the only major corporate player in the field, recently developed two very active catalyst systems tailored to the hydroesterification of either alkenes or alkynes. The hydroesterification of propyne with their Pd(OAc)2\/PN\/HA (PN = (2-pyridyl)diphenylphosphine, HA = strong acid with weakly coordinating anion, like methanesulfonic acid) catalyst has been declared commercially ready. However, despite the significant progress in the activity of Pd-hydroesterification catalysts, further improvements are warranted. Thus, for example, activity maintenance still seems to be an issue. Homogeneous Pd catalysts are prone to a number of deactivation reactions. Activity and stability promoters are often corrosive and add to the complexity of the system, making it less attractive. Nonetheless, the versatility of the process and its tolerance toward the functional groups of substrates should appeal especially to the makers of specialty products. Although hydroesterification yields esters from alkenes, alkynes, and dienes in fewer steps than hydroformylation does, the latter has some advantages at the current state of the art. (1) Hydroformylation catalysts, particularly some recently published phosphine-modified Rh systems, can achieve very high regioselectivity for the linear product that hydroesterification catalysts cannot match yet. By analogy with hydroformylation, bulkier ligands ought to be tested in hydroesterification to increase normal-ester selectivity. (2) Hydroformylation is proven, commercial. Hydroesterification can only replace it if it can provide significant economic incentives. Similar or just marginally better performance could not justify the cost of development of a new technology. (3) Hydroesterification requires pure CO while hydroformylation uses syngas, a mixture of CO and H2. The latter is typically more available and less expensive (for industrial applications CO is most often separated from syngas). (4) The acid component of the hydroesterification catalyst makes the process corrosive. It would be desirable to develop new hydroesterification catalysts that do not require acid stabilizer\/activity booster. Clearly, any new hydroesterification technology will directly compete with the hydroformylation route. This is especially true for olefin feeds, since both processes add one CO to the olefin, yielding oxygenates that can be converted into identical products. For some niche applications, like the production of MMA from propyne, hydroesterification seems to have an advantage as compared to hydroformylation due to the high activity and selectivity of the Pd(OAc)2\/(2-pyridyl)diphenylphosphine catalyst. Since hydroesterification is an emerging technology, it is reasonable to assume that the potential for improvement is greater than in the mature hydroformylation. It is therefore possible that hydroesterification will become competitive in the future; thus, continued effort in the field is warranted.","4644":"","4645":"","4646":"","4647":"","4648":"","4649":"","4650":"","4651":"","4652":"","4653":"","4654":"","4655":"","4656":"","4657":"","4658":"","4659":"","4660":"","4661":"","4662":"","4663":"","4664":"","4665":"","4666":"","4667":"","4668":"","4669":"","4670":"","4671":"","4672":"","4673":"","4674":"","4675":"","4676":"","4677":"","4678":"","4679":"","4680":"","4681":"","4682":"","4683":"","4684":"","4685":"","4686":"","4687":"","4688":"","4689":"","4690":"","4691":"","4692":"","4693":"","4694":"","4695":"","4696":"","4697":"","4698":"","4699":"","4700":"","4701":"","4702":"","4703":"","4704":"","4705":"","4706":"","4707":"","4708":"","4709":"","4710":"","4711":"","4712":"","4713":"","4714":"","4715":"","4716":"","4717":"","4718":"","4719":"","4720":"","4721":"","4722":"","4723":"","4724":"","4725":"","4726":"","4727":"","4728":"","4729":"","4730":"","4731":"","4732":"","4733":"","4734":"","4735":"","4736":"","4737":"","4738":"","4739":"","4740":"","4741":"","4742":"","4743":"","4744":"","4745":"","4746":"","4747":"","4748":"","4749":"","4750":"","4751":"","4752":"","4753":"","4754":"","4755":"","4756":"","4757":"","4758":"","4759":"","4760":"","4761":"","4762":"","4763":"","4764":"","4765":"","4766":"","4767":"","4768":"","4769":"","4770":"","4771":"","4772":"","4773":"","4774":"","4775":"","4776":"","4777":"","4778":"","4779":"","4780":"","4781":"","4782":"","4783":"","4784":"","4785":"","4786":"","4787":"","4788":"","4789":"","4790":"","4791":"","4792":"","4793":"","4794":"","4795":"","4796":"","4797":"","4798":"","4799":"","4800":"","4801":"","4802":"","4803":"","4804":"","4805":"","4806":"","4807":"","4808":"","4809":"","4810":"","4811":"","4812":"","4813":"","4814":"","4815":"","4816":"","4817":"","4818":"","4819":"","4820":"","4821":"","4822":"","4823":"","4824":"","4825":"","4826":"","4827":"","4828":"","4829":"","4830":"","4831":"","4832":"","4833":"","4834":"","4835":"","4836":"","4837":"","4838":"","4839":"","4840":"","4841":"","4842":"","4843":"","4844":"","4845":"","4846":"","4847":"","4848":"","4849":"","4850":"","4851":"","4852":"","4853":"","4854":"","4855":"","4856":"","4857":"","4858":"","4859":"","4860":"","4861":"","4862":"","4863":"","4864":"","4865":"","4866":"","4867":"","4868":"","4869":"","4870":"","4871":"","4872":"","4873":"","4874":"","4875":"","4876":"","4877":"","4878":"","4879":"","4880":"","4881":"","4882":"","4883":"","4884":"","4885":"","4886":"","4887":"","4888":"","4889":"","4890":"","4891":"","4892":"","4893":"","4894":"","4895":"","4896":"","4897":"","4898":"","4899":"","4900":"","4901":"","4902":"","4903":"","4904":"","4905":"","4906":"","4907":"","4908":"","4909":"","4910":"","4911":"","4912":"","4913":"","4914":"","4915":"","4916":"","4917":"","4918":"","4919":"","4920":"","4921":"","4922":"","4923":"","4924":"","4925":"","4926":"","4927":"Because of the tremendous effort of a great number of researchers, the catalytic asymmetric dialkylzinc addition to aldehydes has become a mature method. Ligands of diverse structures have been obtained, and high enantioselectivity for all different types of aldehydes have been achieved. Among the representative excellent catalysts are compounds 1, 8, 120, 325, 352, and 360 discussed above. However, compared to the well-developed dialkylzinc addition, the catalytic asymmetric reactions of aryl-, vinyl-, and alkynylzinc reagents with aldehydes are still very much under developed. Although catalysts such as (S)-402 and 210 prepared by Pu and Bolm have shown good enantioselectivity for the reaction of diphenylzinc with certain aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, the generality of these catalysts for other [formula: see text] arylzinc reagents have not been studied. The vinylzinc additions using ligands 1 and 412 reported by Oppolzer and Wipf were highly enantioselective for certain aromatic aldehydes but not as good for aliphatic aldehydes. Carreira discovered highly enantioselective alkynylzinc additions to aldehydes promoted by the chiral amino alcohol 415, but this process was not catalytic yet. Ishizaki achieved good enantioselectivity for the catalytic alkynylzinc addition to certain aldehydes by using compounds 160, but the enantioselectivity for simple linear aliphatic aldehydes was low. Another much less explored area is the organozinc addition to ketones. Yus and Fu showed very promising results by using ligands 381 and 406 for both dialkylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to ketones, but the scope of these reactions were still very limited. Therefore, more work is needed for the aryl-, vinyl-, and alkynylzinc additions and for the organozinc addition to ketones, although many good catalysts have been obtained for the dialkylzinc addition to aldehydes. Development of these reactions will allow the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of a great variety of functional chiral alcohols that are either the structural units or synthons of many important organic molecules as well as molecules of biological functions. Macromolecular chiral catalysts have become a very attractive research subject in recent years because these materials offer the advantages of simplified product isolation, easy recovery of the generally quite expensive chiral catalysts, and potential use for continuous production. Three types of macromolecules including flexible achiral polymers anchored with chiral catalysts, rigid and sterically regular main chain chiral polymers, and chiral dendrimers have been used for the asymmetric organozinc addition to aldehydes. Among these materials, the binaphthyl-based polymers such as (R)-451 developed by Pu have shown very high and general enantioselectivity. Study of the binaphthyl polymers in the asymmetric organozinc addition has demonstrated that it is possible to systematically modify the structure and function of the rigid and sterically regular polymer for the development of highly enantioselective polymer catalysts. The catalytic properties of highly enantioselective monomer catalysts can also be preserved in the rigid and sterically regular polymer provided the catalytically active species of the monomer catalyst is not its aggregate. The TADDOL-based polymers and dendrimers prepared by Seebach showed very high and stable enantioselectivity for the diethylzinc addition to benzaldehyde even after many cycles. These studies on macromolecular chiral catalysts demonstrate that these materials are potentially very useful for practical applications.","4928":"","4929":"","4930":"","4931":"","4932":"There have been many new and exciting developments in mass spectrometer systems in recent years. Many of these developments are being driven by challenges presented by molecular biology. The activity is fueled by resources being devoted to drug development, for example, and other medically and biologically related activities. Progress in these applications will be accelerated by improved sensitivity, specificity, and speed. In mass spectrometry, this translates to greater mass resolving power, mass accuracy, mass-to-charge range, efficiency, and speed. It is safe to say that the demands resulting from current analytical needs are likely to be met to varying degrees but probably not by a single analyzer technology or hybrid instrument. On-line and\/or off-line separations and manipulations combined with mass spectrometry will also play increasingly important roles. For any analyzer, or combination of analyzers, to become widely used it must have an important application for which its figures of merit are best suited, relative to competing approaches. The relative cost of competing technologies is also an important factor. The mass filter has seen so much use in the past 30 years because its characteristics best fit a wide range of applications. As an example, biological applications, which are currently driving many instrument development activities in mass spectrometry, demand more information, of higher quality, from less material, faster, and at lower cost. Which technologies will dominate biological applications in the coming years is open to speculation. However, in considering the relative merits of today's dominant mass analyzers, areas of opportunity for improvement are apparent. Furthermore, new and more demanding measurement needs are constantly being recognized that will continue to exercise the creativity of the mass spectrometry community.","4933":"","4934":"","4935":"","4936":"","4937":"","4938":"","4939":"In the past 25 years, a tremendous amount of work has been published on the ion\/molecule reactions of organic species. This review provides an overview of the areas where gas phase ion chemistry has made a contribution to our understanding of fundamental organic reaction processes. It is clear that the gas phase work can provide insights into subtle features of reaction mechanisms that could not be addressed by conventional condensed phase methods. The study of ion\/molecule reactions has already had a major impact on the way that organic chemists think about reaction mechanisms and interpret substituent effects. Moreover, it has heightened our awareness of the importance of solvation effects and how they can alter not only absolute rates but also relative rates, leading in some cases to complete reversals in reactivity patterns. A large body of work could not be included in this review due to space limitations. For example, the study of thermochemistry in the gas phase (i.e., acidities, basicities, bond strengths, binding energies, etc.) has provided a wealth of data that has been exceptionally useful in interpreting organic reaction mechanisms. This has spilled over into the study of organometallic systems, and several groups are making major headway in using mass spectrometry to probe the stability and reactivity of transition metal species. Finally, work involving chemical ionization has provided abundant information on gas phase reaction mechanisms. The future appears to be very promising for the study of gas phase organic reaction mechanisms. In particular, the emergence of new ionization techniques and more powerful mass analyzers will allow chemists to explore a wider range of species. Although still at an early stage, the gas phase study of biochemical transformations offers great promise and has been facilitated by electrospray and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization methods. In addition, these techniques provide a means for introducing important, metal-centered catalytic species into the gas phase and exploring the details of their reactivity. Finally, mass spectrometry continues to play a major role in the study of atmospheric ion chemistry and is providing important kinetic as well as mechanistic data.","4940":"","4941":"","4942":"","4943":"","4944":"","4945":"","4946":"In a previous review it was predicted that \"the reactivity of five-coordinate complexes would certainly be different than that of the four-coordinate derivatives\". Structurally and spectroscopically, there is very little difference in the higher-coordinate compounds when compared to the four-coordinate derivatives. However, the prediction was remarkably accurate, if not a bit understated, for the reactivity of these compounds. There appears to be a tremendous potential in catalysis and synthesis for the five-coordinate derivatives, far more possibilities than exist for the lower-coordinate derivatives. Furthermore, the higher-coordinate derivatives are rarely air or moisture sensitive and, thus, may be handled under a wider range of conditions. Although reactions such as oxirane and lactide polymerizations are fairly well-known now with five- and six-coordinate aluminum compounds, the potential of these compounds has only begun to be developed. It is easy to imagine that these types of compounds will see wider use than the related transition-metal compounds.","4947":"","4948":"","4949":"","4950":"","4951":"","4952":"","4953":"","4954":"","4955":"","4956":"","4957":"","4958":"Figure 18 presents the C-O stretching vibrational frequencies of the first-row transition-metal monocarbonyl cations, neutrals, and anions in solid neon; similar diagrams have been reported for neutral MCO species in solid argon, but three of the early assignments have been changed by recent work and one new assignment added. The laser-ablation method produces mostly neutral atoms with a few percent cations and electrons for capture to make anions; in contrast, thermal evaporation gives only neutral species. Hence, the very recent neon matrix investigations in our laboratory provide carbonyl cations and anions for comparison to neutrals on a level playing field. Several trends are very interesting. First, for all metals, the C-O stretching frequencies follow the order cations &gt; neutrals &gt; anions with large diagnostic 100-200 cm-1 separations, which is consistent with the magnitude of the metal d to CO pi * donation. Second, for a given charge, there is a general increase in C-O stretching vibrational frequencies with increasing metal atomic number, which demonstrates the expected decrease in the metal to CO pi * donation with increasing metal ionization potential. Some of the structure in this plot arises from the extra stability of the filled and half-filled d shell and from the electron pairing that occurs at the middle of the TM row; the plot resembles the \"double-humped\" graph found for the variation in properties across a row of transition metals. For the anions, the variation with metal atom is the smallest since all of the metals can easily donate charge to the CO ligand. Third, for the early transition-metal Ti, V, and Cr families, the C-O stretching frequencies decrease when going down the family, but the reverse relationship is observed for the late transition-metal Fe, Co, and Ni families. In most of the present discussion, we have referred to neon matrix frequencies; however, the argon matrix frequencies are complementary, and useful information can be obtained from comparison of the two matrix hosts. In most cases, the neon-to-argon red shift for neutral carbonyls is from 11 to 26 cm-1, but a few (CrCO) lie outside of this range. In the case of FeCO and Fe(CO)2, it appears that neon and argon trap different low-lying electronic states. In general, the carbonyl neutrals and anions have similar shifts but carbonyl cations have larger matrix shifts. For example, the FeCO+ fundamental is at 2123.0 cm-1 in neon and 2081.5 cm-1 in argon, a 42.5 cm-1 shift, which is larger than those found for FeCO- (11.7 cm-1) and FeCO (11.7 cm-1). It is unusual for different low-lying electronic states to be trapped in different matrices, but CUO provides another example. The linear singlet state (1047.3, 872.2 cm-1) is trapped in solid neon, and a calculated 1.2 kcal\/mol higher triplet state is trapped in solid argon (852.5, 804.3 cm-1) and stabilized by a specific interaction with argon. The bonding trends are well described by theoretical calculations of vibrational frequencies. Table 5 compares the scale factors (observed neon matrix\/calculated) for the C-O stretching modes of the monocarbonyl cations, neutrals, and anions of the first-row transition metals observed in a neon matrix using the B3LYP and BP86 density functionals. Most of the calculated carbonyl harmonic stretching frequencies are within 1% of the experimental fundamentals at the BP86 level of theory, while calculations using the B3LYP functional give frequencies that are 3-4% higher as expected for these density functionals and calculations on saturated TM-carbonyls. For second- and third-row carbonyls using the BP86 density functional and the LANL effective core potential in conjunction with the DZ basis set, the agreement between theory and experiment is just as good. For example, the 16 M(CO)1-4 neutral and anion and 2 MCO+ cation (M = Ru, Os) carbonyl frequencies are fit within 1.5%. The 16 species (M = Rh, Ir) are fit within 1%, but the Rh(CO)1-4+ calculations are 2-3% too low and Ir(CO)1-4+ computations are 1-2% too low. In addition to predicting the vibrational frequencies, DFT can be used to calculate different isotopic frequencies, and isotopic frequency ratios can be computed as a measure of the normal vibrational mode in the molecule for an additional diagnostic. For diatomic CO, the 12CO\/13CO ratio 1.0225 and C16O\/C18O ratio 1.0244 characterize a pure C-O stretching mode. In a series of molecules such as RhCO+, RhCO, and RhCO-, where the metal-CO bonding varies, the Rh-C, C-O vibrational interaction is different and the unique isotopic ratios for the carbonyl vibration are characteristic of that particular molecule. Table 6 summarizes the isotopic ratios observed and calculated for the RhCO+,0,- species. Note that RhCO+ exhibits slightly more carbon-13 and less oxygen-18 involvement in the C-O vibration than CO itself and that this trend increases to RhCO and to RhCO- as the Rh-C bond becomes shorter and stronger. Note also how closely the calculated and observed ratios both follow this trend. In a molecule with two C-O stretching modes, for example, bent Ni(CO)2 exhibits a strong b2 mode at 1978.9 cm-1 and a weak a1 mode at 2089.7 cm-1 in solid neon, and these two modes involve different C and O participations. The symmetric mode shows substantially more C (1.0242) and less O (1.0217) participation than does the antisymmetric mode with C (1.0228) and O (1.0238) involvement, based on the given isotopic frequency ratios, which are nicely matched by DFT calculations (a1 1.0244, 1.0224 and b2 1.0232, 1.0241, respectively). These investigations of vibrational frequencies in unsaturated transition-metal carbonyl cations, neutrals, and anions clearly demonstrate the value of a close working relationship between experiment and theory to identify and characterize new molecular species.","4959":"","4960":"","4961":"","4962":"","4963":"","4964":"","4965":"","4966":"","4967":"","4968":"","4969":"","4970":"","4971":"","4972":"","4973":"","4974":"Strong attractive intramolecular X&lt;--Y(S, NR') interactions of 1,5-type occurring between terminal electron-rich main-group 15-17 centers (X = pnictogen, chalcogen, or halogen) and carbonyl, thione, or imine groups (Y = O, S, NR') incorporated into the conjugated -X-CH=CH-CH=Y fragments result in significant stabilization of cis-s-cis structure of these molecules, which may be viewed as the five-membered pseudo-heterocycles with the hypervalent arrangements across the pnictogen, chalcogen, or halogen centers. In derivatives of beta-chalcovinylaldehydes and isoelectronic chloronium cations, one of two lone electron pairs at X = S, Se, Te, Cl+ possesses pure p character and is involved in conjugation with the pi-system of the rest of the molecule, which leads to an appreciable contribution of the aromatic stabilization of the 6 pi-electron ring closed by the X&lt;--Y bond. The aromaticity of these structures evaluated through calculation of the homodesmotic stabilization energies (HSE) increases in parallel with an increase in the strength of the intramolecular coordination bonds, i.e., in the order X = S, Se, Te and with an increase in electronegativity of a substituent attached to the chalcogen atom. Clear manifestation of the aromatic character of the cis-s-cis isomers of beta-chalcovinylaldehydes, their imines, as well as congeneric thiones and chloronium cations comes from the theoretical and experimental evidence for the pronounced equalization (as compared with the open trans-s-trans isomers) of the CC bond lengths. The cooperative effects of the hypervalent bonding and aromaticity are most distinct in the bicyclic structures of 1,6,6a lambda 4-trichalcapentalenes, their 1,6-dioxa(aza) analogues, and 1,6-dioxa-3a-aza-6a lambda 4-pnictapentalenes, in which two conjugated -X-CH=CH-CH=Y fragments are fused together via the symmetric -Y-X-Y- triad. The assessments based on the HSE values indicate that the aromaticity of these 10 pi-electron compounds is estimated as about 30-50% of the aromatic character of the most aromatic bicyclic structure of naphthalene. As shown by extensive ab initio calculations, substantial hypervalent bonding effects also operate in the case of beta-pnictovinylaldehydes formed by second and lower row pnictogen atoms (X = P, As, Sb, Bi), providing for the enhanced stability of their cis-s-cis configuration with respect to the free-of-strain trans-s-trans structures. The bicyclic 1,6,6a lambda 5-dioxapnictapentalene structure is also the most energy favorable form of these compounds. However, by contrast with the chalcogen and halonium analogues, the pseudo-cyclic structure of beta-pnictovinylaldehydes and the bicyclic structure of 1,6,6a lambda 5-dioxapnictapentalenes are maintained through primarily the occurrence of the hypervalent bonding across the pnictogen centers, whereas pi-delocalization is not (or weakly) operative in these compounds. A possible explanation for this finding is the low p character of the single lone electron pair at the pnictogen and orientation of the axis of its orbital, which is unfavorable for the optimal overlap with the pi-system of the rest of a molecule. As first proposed by Arduengo and Dixon, configurational isomerizations at the second and lower row tricoordinate pnictogen centers may proceed through the T-shaped hypervalent structures. Such a structure is strongly stabilized in the aromatic 1,6-dioxa-3a-aza-6a lambda 4-pnictapentalenes. It was found by calculations that the aromatic stabilization of the T-shaped hypervalent arrangement at the tricoordinate pnictogen center in 2H-1,3,2-dioxaphosphole and arsole arising due to withdrawal of two electrons from the pi-system of the ring onto the hypervalent electron-excessive center facilitates the rearrangement and directs it along the reaction path with the aromatic transition-state structure. Investigation of the influence of cooperative effects of hypervalent bonding and aromaticity on stability and mechanisms of reactions of main-group 14-17 compounds not considered in this review is the subject of our continuing research.","4975":"","4976":null,"4977":"","4978":"","4979":"Chemical bonding models based on graph theory or tensor surface harmonic theory demonstrate the analogy between the aromaticity in two-dimensional planar polygonal hydrocarbons such as benzene and that in three-dimensional deltahedral borane anions of the type BnHn2- (6 &lt; or = n &lt; or = 12). Such models are supported both by diverse computational studies and experimental determinations of electron density distribution.

Several overarching themes emerge from this review. First and foremost, there is a pressing need to better understand in detail the catalytic mechanisms involved in almost every process area mentioned above. This includes the structures, energetics, lifetimes, and reactivities of the species thought to be important in the key catalytic cycles. As much of this type of information as is possible to acquire would also greatly aid in better understanding perplexing, incomplete\/inefficient catalytic cycles and in inventing new, efficient ones. The most productive way to attack such problems must include long-term, in-depth fundamental studies of both commercial and model processes, by conventional research techniques and, importantly, by applying various promising new physicochemical and computational approaches which would allow incisive, in situ elucidation of reaction pathways. There is also a consensus that more exploratory experiments, especially high-risk, unconventional catalytic and model studies, should be undertaken. Such an effort will likely require specialized equipment, instrumentation, and computational facilities. The most expeditious and cost-effective means to carry out this research would be by close coupling of academic, industrial, and national laboratory catalysis efforts worldwide. Completely new research approaches should be vigorously explored, ranging from novel compositions, fabrication techniques, reactors, and reaction conditions for heterogeneous catalysts, to novel ligands and ligation geometries (e.g., biomimetic), reaction media, and activation methods for homogeneous ones. The interplay between these two areas involving various hybrid and single-site supported catalyst systems should also be productive. Finally, new combinatorial and semicombinatorial means to rapidly create and screen catalyst systems are now available. As a complement to the approaches noted above, these techniques promise to greatly accelerate catalyst discovery, evaluation, and understanding. They should be incorporated in the vigorous international research effort needed in this field.","5003":"","5004":"","5005":"","5006":"","5007":"","5008":"","5009":"","5010":"","5011":"","5012":"","5013":"","5014":"","5015":"","5016":"","5017":"","5018":"","5019":"","5020":"","5021":"","5022":"","5023":"","5024":"","5025":"","5026":"","5027":"","5028":"","5029":"","5030":"","5031":"","5032":"","5033":"","5034":"","5035":"","5036":"","5037":"","5038":"","5039":"","5040":"","5041":"","5042":"","5043":"","5044":"","5045":"","5046":"","5047":"","5048":"","5049":"","5050":"","5051":"","5052":"","5053":"","5054":"","5055":"","5056":"","5057":"","5058":"","5059":"","5060":"","5061":"","5062":"","5063":"","5064":"","5065":"","5066":"","5067":"","5068":"","5069":"","5070":"","5071":"","5072":"","5073":"","5074":"","5075":"","5076":"","5077":"","5078":"","5079":"","5080":"","5081":"","5082":"","5083":"","5084":"","5085":"","5086":"","5087":"","5088":"","5089":"","5090":"","5091":"","5092":"","5093":"","5094":"","5095":"","5096":"","5097":"","5098":"","5099":"","5100":"","5101":"","5102":"","5103":"","5104":"","5105":"","5106":"","5107":"","5108":"","5109":"","5110":"","5111":"","5112":"","5113":"","5114":"","5115":"","5116":"","5117":"","5118":"","5119":"","5120":"","5121":"","5122":"","5123":"","5124":"","5125":"","5126":"","5127":"","5128":"","5129":"","5130":"","5131":"","5132":"","5133":"","5134":"","5135":"","5136":"","5137":"","5138":"","5139":"","5140":"","5141":"","5142":"","5143":"","5144":"","5145":"","5146":"","5147":"","5148":"","5149":"","5150":"","5151":"","5152":"","5153":"","5154":"","5155":"","5156":"","5157":"","5158":"","5159":"","5160":"","5161":"","5162":"","5163":"","5164":"","5165":"","5166":"","5167":"","5168":"","5169":"","5170":"","5171":"","5172":"","5173":"","5174":"","5175":"","5176":"","5177":"","5178":"","5179":"","5180":"","5181":"","5182":"","5183":"","5184":"","5185":"","5186":"","5187":"","5188":"","5189":"","5190":"","5191":"","5192":"","5193":"","5194":"","5195":"","5196":"","5197":"","5198":"The authors provide a review and literature survey of many-body effects in intermolecular forces.
