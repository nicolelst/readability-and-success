years after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, the association between exposures present at the World Trade Center (WTC) site and the risk of several specific types of cancer has been reported among rescue and recovery workers. The authors' objective was to conduct an updated review of these data. Most studies have found elevated rates of both prostate and thyroid cancers compared with rates in the general population, and some have reported statistically significant differences for the rates of all cancers as well. Studies including a larger combined cohort of WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers from 3 main cohorts have since replicated findings for these cancers, with additional years of follow-up. Among this combined cohort, although a lower-than-expected standardized incidence ratio for all cancers was observed, WTC exposure was also related to an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma and tonsil cancer. Importantly, another study found that WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers who are enrolled in the federally funded medical monitoring and treatment program experienced improved survival post-cancer diagnosis compared with New York state patients with cancer. On the basis of these combined cohort studies, the full effect of WTC exposure on cancer risk is becoming clearer. Consequently, the authors believe that surveillance of those with WTC exposure should be continued, and in-depth analysis of epidemiologic, molecular, and clinical aspects of specific cancers in these workers should be pursued.","1":"The integration of genomic data into personalized treatment planning has revolutionized oncology care. Despite this, patients with cancer remain vulnerable to high rates of adverse drug events and medication inefficacy, affecting prognosis and quality of life. Pharmacogenomics is a field seeking to identify germline genetic variants that contribute to an individual's unique drug response. Although there is widespread integration of genomic information in oncology, somatic platforms, rather than germline biomarkers, have dominated the attention of cancer providers. Patients with cancer potentially stand to benefit from improved integration of both somatic and germline genomic information, especially because the latter may complement treatment planning by informing toxicity risk for drugs with treatment-limiting tolerabilities and narrow therapeutic indices. Although certain germline pharmacogenes, such as TPMT, UGT1A1, and DPYD, have been recognized for decades, recent attention has illuminated modern potential dosing implications for a whole new set of anticancer agents, including targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, as well as the discovery of additional genetic variants and newly relevant pharmacogenes. Some of this information has risen to the level of directing clinical action, with US Food and Drug Administration label guidance and recommendations by international societies and governing bodies. This review is focused on key new pharmacogenomic evidence and oncology-specific dosing recommendations. Personalized oncology care through integrated pharmacogenomics represents a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between oncologists, laboratory science, bioinformatics, pharmacists, clinical pharmacologists, and genetic counselors, among others. The authors posit that expanded consideration of germline genetic information can further transform the safe and effective practice of oncology in 2022 and beyond.","2":"Sexual function is a vital aspect of human health and is recognized as a critical component of cancer survivorship. Understanding and evaluating the impacts of radiotherapy on female sexual function requires precise knowledge of the organs involved in sexual function and the relationship between radiotherapy exposure and sexual tissue function. Although substantial evidence exists describing the impact of radiotherapy on male erectile tissues and related clinical sexual outcomes, there is very little research in this area in females. The lack of biomedical data in female patients makes it difficult to design studies aimed at optimizing sexual function postradiotherapy for female pelvic malignancies. This scoping review identifies and categorizes current research on the impacts of radiotherapy on normal female erectile tissues, including damage to normal functioning, clinical outcomes of radiation-related female erectile tissue damage, and techniques to spare erectile tissues or therapies to treat such damage. An evaluation of the evidence was performed, and a summary of findings was generated according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Articles were included in the review that involved normal female erectile tissues and radiotherapy side effects. The results show that little scientific investigation into the impacts of radiotherapy on female erectile tissues has been performed. Collaborative scientific investigations by clinical, basic, and behavioral scientists in oncology and radiotherapy are needed to generate radiobiologic and clinical evidence to advance prospective evaluation, prevention, and mitigation strategies that may improve sexual outcomes in female patients.","3":"The overall 5-year relative survival rate for all cancers combined is now 68%, and there are over 16.9 million survivors in the United States. Evidence from laboratory and observational studies suggests that factors such as diet, physical activity, and obesity may affect risk for recurrence and overall survival after a cancer diagnosis. The purpose of this American Cancer Society guideline is to provide evidence-based, cancer-specific recommendations for anthropometric parameters, physical activity, diet, and alcohol intake for reducing recurrence and cancer-specific and overall mortality. The audiences for this guideline are health care providers caring for cancer survivors as well as cancer survivors and their families. The guideline is intended to serve as a resource for informing American Cancer Society programs, health policy, and the media. Sources of evidence that form the basis of this guideline are systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses, pooled analyses of cohort studies, and large randomized clinical trials published since 2012. Recommendations for nutrition and physical activity during cancer treatment, informed by current practice, large cancer care organizations, and reviews of other expert bodies, are also presented. To provide additional context for the guidelines, the authors also include information on the relationship between health-related behaviors and comorbidities, long-term sequelae and patient-reported outcomes, and health disparities, with attention to enabling survivors' ability to adhere to recommendations. Approaches to meet survivors' needs are addressed as well as clinical care coordination and resources for nutrition and physical activity counseling after a cancer diagnosis.","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"Inherited genetic mutations can significantly increase the risk for prostate cancer (PC), may be associated with aggressive disease and poorer outcomes, and can have hereditary cancer implications for men and their families. Germline genetic testing (hereditary cancer genetic testing) is now strongly recommended for patients with advanced\/metastatic PC, particularly given the impact on targeted therapy selection or clinical trial options, with expanded National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and endorsement from multiple professional societies. Furthermore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend genetic testing for men with PC across the stage and risk spectrum and for unaffected men at high risk for PC based on family history to identify hereditary cancer risk. Primary care is a critical field in which providers evaluate men at an elevated risk for PC, men living with PC, and PC survivors for whom germline testing may be indicated. Therefore, there is a critical need to engage and educate primary care providers regarding the role of genetic testing and the impact of results on PC screening, treatment, and cascade testing for family members of affected men. This review highlights key aspects of genetic testing in PC, the role of clinicians, with a focus on primary care, the importance of obtaining a comprehensive family history, current germline testing guidelines, and the impact on precision PC care. With emerging evidence and guidelines, clinical pathways are needed to facilitate integrated genetic education, testing, and counseling services in appropriately selected patients. There is also a need for providers to understand the field of genetic counseling and how best to collaborate to enhance multidisciplinary patient care.","8":"African American\/Black individuals have a disproportionate cancer burden, including the highest mortality and the lowest survival of any racial\/ethnic group for most cancers. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths for Black people in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence (herein through 2018), mortality (through 2019), survival, screening, and risk factors using population-based data from the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there will be approximately 224,080 new cancer cases and 73,680 cancer deaths among Black people in the United States. During the most recent 5-year period, Black men had a 6% higher incidence rate but 19% higher mortality than White men overall, including an approximately 2-fold higher risk of death from myeloma, stomach cancer, and prostate cancer. The overall cancer mortality disparity is narrowing between Black and White men because of a steeper drop in Black men for lung and prostate cancers. However, the decline in prostate cancer mortality in Black men slowed from 5% annually during 2010 through 2014 to 1.3% during 2015 through 2019, likely reflecting the 5% annual increase in advanced-stage diagnoses since 2012. Black women have an 8% lower incidence rate than White women but a 12% higher mortality; further, mortality rates are 2-fold higher for endometrial cancer and 41% higher for breast cancer despite similar or lower incidence rates. The wide breast cancer disparity reflects both later stage diagnosis (57% localized stage vs 67% in White women) and lower 5-year survival overall (82% vs 92%, respectively) and for every stage of disease (eg, 20% vs 30%, respectively, for distant stage). Breast cancer surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among Black women in 2019. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce stark cancer inequalities in the Black community.","9":"","10":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and\/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.","11":"","12":"","13":"Generating evidence on the use, effectiveness, and safety of new cancer therapies is a priority for researchers, health care providers, payers, and regulators given the rapid pace of change in cancer diagnosis and treatments. The use of real-world data (RWD) is integral to understanding the utilization patterns and outcomes of these new treatments among patients with cancer who are treated in clinical practice and community settings. An initial step in the use of RWD is careful study design to assess the suitability of an RWD source. This pivotal process can be guided by using a conceptual model that encourages predesign conceptualization. The primary types of RWD included are electronic health records, administrative claims data, cancer registries, and specialty data providers and networks. Careful consideration of each data type is necessary because they are collected for a specific purpose, capturing a set of data elements within a certain population for that purpose, and they vary by population coverage and longitudinality. In this review, the authors provide a high-level assessment of the strengths and limitations of each data category to inform data source selection appropriate to the study question. Overall, the development and accessibility of RWD sources for cancer research are rapidly increasing, and the use of these data requires careful consideration of composition and utility to assess important questions in understanding the use and effectiveness of new therapies.","14":"The authors define molecular imaging, according to the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, as the visualization, characterization, and measurement of biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels in humans and other living systems. Although practiced for many years clinically in nuclear medicine, expansion to other imaging modalities began roughly 25 years ago and has accelerated since. That acceleration derives from the continual appearance of new and highly relevant animal models of human disease, increasingly sensitive imaging devices, high-throughput methods to discover and optimize affinity agents to key cellular targets, new ways to manipulate genetic material, and expanded use of cloud computing. Greater interest by scientists in allied fields, such as chemistry, biomedical engineering, and immunology, as well as increased attention by the pharmaceutical industry, have likewise contributed to the boom in activity in recent years. Whereas researchers and clinicians have applied molecular imaging to a variety of physiologic processes and disease states, here, the authors focus on oncology, arguably where it has made its greatest impact. The main purpose of imaging in oncology is early detection to enable interception if not prevention of full-blown disease, such as the appearance of metastases. Because biochemical changes occur before changes in anatomy, molecular imaging-particularly when combined with liquid biopsy for screening purposes-promises especially early localization of disease for optimum management. Here, the authors introduce the ways and indications in which molecular imaging can be undertaken, the tools used and under development, and near-term challenges and opportunities in oncology.","15":null,"16":"","17":"","18":"Although rare, the rate of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) is rising globally. Most patients present with nonmetastatic disease and are curable with appropriate treatment, which has evolved significantly over the last several decades. Before the 1970s, SCCA was managed with radical surgery, resulting in a permanent colostomy. Researchers found that preoperative treatment with chemotherapy and concurrent radiation could achieve a pathologic complete response. After this observation, definitive therapy shifted from radical surgery to sphincter-preserving chemoradiation. Investigations into the necessity of chemotherapy and the optimal regimen found that chemotherapy with mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil is required for cure. Further studies evaluating the addition of induction or maintenance chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, or higher radiation doses have demonstrated no significant benefit to disease control. Advanced radiation delivery with intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques is now considered the standard of care because of its prospectively determined, favorable acute toxicity profile compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiation. It is important to note that chemoradiation treatment response may be slow (up to 26 weeks) and should be assessed through serial clinical examinations. Today, surgical management of SCCA is reserved only for the lowest risk, early stage tumors or for recurrent\/persistent disease. Current studies are evaluating radiation dose de-escalation in early stage disease and radiation dose escalation and the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors in locally advanced cancers. In reviewing how and why modern-day treatment of SCCA was established, the objective of this report is to reenforce adherence to current treatment paradigms to assure the best possible outcomes for patients.","19":"Smoking cessation reduces the risk of death, improves recovery, and reduces the risk of hospital readmission. Evidence and policy support hospital admission as an ideal time to deliver smoking-cessation interventions. However, this is not well implemented in practice. In this systematic review, the authors summarize the literature on smoking-cessation implementation strategies and evaluate their success to guide the implementation of best-practice smoking interventions into hospital settings. The CINAHL Complete, Embase, MEDLINE Complete, and PsycInfo databases were searched using terms associated with the following topics: smoking cessation, hospitals, and implementation. In total, 14,287 original records were identified and screened, resulting in 63 eligible articles from 56 studies. Data were extracted on the study characteristics, implementation strategies, and implementation outcomes. Implementation outcomes were guided by Proctor and colleagues' framework and included acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, cost, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability. The findings demonstrate that studies predominantly focused on the training of staff to achieve implementation. Brief implementation approaches using a small number of implementation strategies were less successful and poorly sustained compared with well resourced and multicomponent approaches. Although brief implementation approaches may be viewed as advantageous because they are less resource-intensive, their capacity to change practice in a sustained way lacks evidence. Attempts to change clinician behavior or introduce new models of care are challenging in a short time frame, and implementation efforts should be designed for long-term success. There is a need to embrace strategic, well planned implementation approaches to embed smoking-cessation interventions into hospitals and to reap and sustain the benefits for people who smoke.","20":"Radiation therapy (RT) continues to play an important role in the treatment of cancer. Adaptive RT (ART) is a novel method through which RT treatments are evolving. With the ART approach, computed tomography or magnetic resonance (MR) images are obtained as part of the treatment delivery process. This enables the adaptation of the irradiated volume to account for changes in organ and\/or tumor position, movement, size, or shape that may occur over the course of treatment. The advantages and challenges of ART maybe somewhat abstract to oncologists and clinicians outside of the specialty of radiation oncology. ART is positioned to affect many different types of cancer. There is a wide spectrum of hypothesized benefits, from small toxicity improvements to meaningful gains in overall survival. The use and application of this novel technology should be understood by the oncologic community at large, such that it can be appropriately contextualized within the landscape of cancer therapies. Likewise, the need to test these advances is pressing. MR-guided ART (MRgART) is an emerging, extended modality of ART that expands upon and further advances the capabilities of ART. MRgART presents unique opportunities to iteratively improve adaptive image guidance. However, although the MRgART adaptive process advances ART to previously unattained levels, it can be more expensive, time-consuming, and complex. In this review, the authors present an overview for clinicians describing the process of ART and specifically MRgART.","21":"As distinct cancer biomarkers have been discovered in recent years, a need to reclassify tumors by more than their histology has been proposed, and therapies are now tailored to treat cancers based on specific molecular aberrations and immunologic markers. In fact, multiple histology-agnostic therapies are currently adopted in clinical practice for treating patients regardless of their tumor site of origin. In parallel with this new model for drug development, in the past few years, several novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been approved to treat solid tumors, benefiting from engineering improvements in the conjugation process and the introduction of novel linkers and payloads. With the recognition that numerous surface targets are expressed across various cancer histologies, alongside the remarkable activity of modern ADCs, this drug class has been increasingly evaluated as suitable for a histology-agnostic expansion of indication. For illustration, the anti-HER2 ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan has demonstrated compelling activity in HER2-overexpressing breast, gastric, colorectal, and lung cancer. Examples of additional novel and potentially histology-agnostic ADC targets include trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) and nectin-4, among others. In the current review article, the authors summarize the current approvals of ADCs by the US Food and Drug Administration focusing on solid tumors and discuss the challenges and opportunities posed by the multihistological expansion of ADCs.","22":"The increase in cancer incidence and mortality is challenging current cancer care delivery globally, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) when it comes to receiving evidence-based cancer prevention, treatment, and palliative and survivorship care. Patients in LMICs often rely on traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) that is more familiar, less costly, and widely available. However, spheres of influence and tensions between conventional medicine and TCIM can further disrupt efforts in evidence-based cancer care. Integrative oncology provides a framework to research and integrate safe, effective TCIM alongside conventional cancer treatment and can help bridge health care gaps in delivering evidence-informed, patient-centered care. This growing field uses lifestyle modifications, mind and body therapies (eg, acupuncture, massage, meditation, and yoga), and natural products to improve symptom management and quality of life among patients with cancer. On the basis of this review of the global challenges of cancer control and the current status of integrative oncology, the authors recommend: 1) educating and integrating TCIM providers into the cancer control workforce to promote risk reduction and culturally salient healthy life styles; 2) developing and testing TCIM interventions to address cancer symptoms or treatment-related adverse effects (eg, pain, insomnia, fatigue); and 3) disseminating and implementing evidence-based TCIM interventions as part of comprehensive palliative and survivorship care so patients from all cultures can live with or beyond cancer with respect, dignity, and vitality. With conventional medicine and TCIM united under a cohesive framework, integrative oncology may provide citizens of the world with access to safe, effective, evidence-informed, and culturally sensitive cancer care.","23":"Oral mucositis (OM) is a common, highly symptomatic complication of cancer therapy that affects patients' function, quality of life, and ability to tolerate treatment. In certain patients with cancer, OM is associated with increased mortality. Research on the management of OM is ongoing. Oral mucosal toxicities are also reported in targeted and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. The objective of this article is to present current knowledge about the epidemiology, pathogenesis, assessment, risk prediction, and current and developing intervention strategies for OM and other ulcerative mucosal toxicities caused by both conventional and evolving forms of cancer therapy.","24":"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a promising immunotherapeutic treatment concept that is changing the treatment approach to hematologic malignancies. The development of CAR T-cell therapy represents a prime example for the successful bench-to-bedside translation of advances in immunology and cellular therapy into clinical practice. The currently available CAR T-cell products have shown high response rates and long-term remissions in patients with relapsed\/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and relapsed\/refractory lymphoma. However, CAR T-cell therapy can induce severe life-threatening toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or infection, which require rapid and aggressive medical treatment in the intensive care unit setting. In this review, the authors provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in the clinical management of severe life-threatening events in CAR T-cell recipients. Furthermore, key challenges that have to be overcome to maximize the safety of CAR T cells are discussed.","25":"","26":"","27":"Infection is the second leading cause of death in patients with cancer. Loss of efficacy in antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an urgent threat against the continuing success of cancer therapy. In this review, the authors focus on recent updates on the impact of antibiotic resistance in the cancer setting, particularly on the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.). This review highlights the health and financial impact of antibiotic resistance in patients with cancer. Furthermore, the authors recommend measures to control the emergence of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the risk factors associated with cancer care. A lack of data in the etiology of infections, specifically in oncology patients in United States, is identified as a concern, and the authors advocate for a centralized and specialized surveillance system for patients with cancer to predict and prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Finding better ways to predict, prevent, and treat antibiotic-resistant infections will have a major positive impact on the care of those with cancer.","28":"The Hispanic\/Latino population is the second largest racial\/ethnic group in the continental United States and Hawaii, accounting for 18% (60.6 million) of the total population. An additional 3 million Hispanic Americans live in Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanic individuals in the United States using the most recent population-based data. An estimated 176,600 new cancer cases and 46,500 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanic individuals in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2021. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Hispanic men and women had 25%-30% lower incidence (2014-2018) and mortality (2015-2019) rates for all cancers combined and lower rates for the most common cancers, although this gap is diminishing. For example, the colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rate ratio for Hispanic compared with NHW individuals narrowed from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.78) in 1995 to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93) in 2018, reflecting delayed declines in CRC rates among Hispanic individuals in part because of slower uptake of screening. In contrast, Hispanic individuals have higher rates of infection-related cancers, including approximately two-fold higher incidence of liver and stomach cancer. Cervical cancer incidence is 32% higher among Hispanic women in the continental US and Hawaii and 78% higher among women in Puerto Rico compared to NHW women, yet is largely preventable through screening. Less access to care may be similarly reflected in the low prevalence of localized-stage breast cancer among Hispanic women, 59% versus 67% among NHW women. Evidence-based strategies for decreasing the cancer burden among the Hispanic population include the use of culturally appropriate lay health advisors and patient navigators and targeted, community-based intervention programs to facilitate access to screening and promote healthy behaviors. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer trends and disparities in the Hispanic population should be closely monitored.","29":"Despite being highly preventable, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer and cause of cancer death in women globally. In low-income countries, cervical cancer is often the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are at a particularly high risk of cervical cancer because of an impaired immune response to human papillomavirus, the obligate cause of virtually all cervical cancers. Globally, approximately 1 in 20 cervical cancers is attributable to HIV; in sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 1 in 5 cervical cancers is due to HIV. Here, the authors provide a critical appraisal of the evidence to date on the impact of HIV disease on cervical cancer risk, describe key methodologic issues, and frame the key outstanding research questions, especially as they apply to ongoing global efforts for prevention and control of cervical cancer. Expanded efforts to integrate HIV care with cervical cancer prevention and control, and vice versa, could assist the global effort to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.","30":"","31":"Brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors are among the most fatal cancers and account for substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States. Population-based data from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (a combined data set of the National Program of Cancer Registries [NPCR] and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] registries), NPCR, National Vital Statistics System and SEER program were analyzed to assess the contemporary burden of malignant and nonmalignant brain and other CNS tumors (hereafter brain) by histology, anatomic site, age, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Malignant brain tumor incidence rates declined by 0.8% annually from 2008 to 2017 for all ages combined but increased 0.5% to 0.7% per year among children and adolescents. Malignant brain tumor incidence is highest in males and non-Hispanic White individuals, whereas the rates for nonmalignant tumors are highest in females and non-Hispanic Black individuals. Five-year relative survival for all malignant brain tumors combined increased between 1975 to 1977 and 2009 to 2015 from 23% to 36%, with larger gains among younger age groups. Less improvement among older age groups largely reflects a higher burden of glioblastoma, for which there have been few major advances in prevention, early detection, and treatment the past 4 decades. Specifically, 5-year glioblastoma survival only increased from 4% to 7% during the same time period. In addition, important survival disparities by race\/ethnicity remain for childhood tumors, with the largest Black-White disparities for diffuse astrocytomas (75% vs 86% for patients diagnosed during 2009-2015) and embryonal tumors (59% vs 67%). Increased resources for the collection and reporting of timely consistent data are critical for advancing research to elucidate the causes of sex, age, and racial\/ethnic differences in brain tumor occurrence, especially for rarer subtypes and among understudied populations.","32":"Chronic caloric restriction (CR) has powerful anticarcinogenic actions in both preclinical and clinical studies but may be difficult to sustain. As an alternative to CR, there has been growing interest in intermittent fasting (IF) in both the scientific and lay community as a result of promising study results, mainly in experimental animal models. According to a survey by the International Food Information Council Foundation, IF has become the most popular diet in the last year, and patients with cancer are seeking advice from oncologists about its beneficial effects for cancer prevention and treatment. However, as discussed in this review, results from IF studies in rodents are controversial and suggest potential detrimental effects in certain oncologic conditions. The effects of IF on human cancer incidence and prognosis remain unknown because of a lack of high-quality randomized clinical trials. Preliminary studies suggest that prolonged fasting in some patients who have cancer is safe and potentially capable of decreasing chemotherapy-related toxicity and tumor growth. However, because additional trials are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of fasting for patients with cancer, the authors would not currently recommend patients undergoing active cancer treatment partake in IF outside the context of a clinical trial. IF may be considered in adults seeking cancer-prevention benefits through means of weight management, but whether IF itself affects cancer-related metabolic and molecular pathways remains unanswered.","33":"","34":"","35":"Radiation therapy (RT) is a curative treatment for many malignancies and provides effective palliation in patients with tumor-related symptoms. However, the biophysical effects of RT are not specific to tumor cells and may produce toxicity due to exposure of surrounding organs and tissues. In this article, the authors review the clinical context, pathophysiology, risk factors, presentation, and management of RT side effects in each human organ system. Ionizing radiation works by producing DNA damage leading to tumor death, but effects on normal tissue may result in acute and\/or late toxicity. The manifestation of toxicity depends on both cellular characteristics and affected organs' anatomy and physiology. There is usually a direct relationship between the radiation dose and volume to normal tissues and the risk of toxicity, which has led to guidelines and recommended dose limits for most tissues. Side effects are multifactorial, with contributions from baseline patient characteristics and other oncologic treatments. Technological advances in recent decades have decreased RT toxicity by dramatically improving the ability to deliver RT that maximizes tumor dose and minimizes organ dose. Thus the study of RT-associated toxicity is a complex, core component of radiation oncology training that continues to evolve alongside advances in cancer management. Because RT is used in up to one-half of all patients with cancer, an understanding of its acute and late effects in different organ systems is clinically pertinent to both oncologists and nononcologists.","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"Distress management (DM) (screening and response) is an essential component of cancer care across the treatment trajectory. Effective DM has many benefits, including improving patients' quality of life; reducing distress, anxiety, and depression; contributing to medical cost offsets; and reducing emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Unfortunately, many distressed patients do not receive needed services. There are several multilevel barriers that represent key challenges to DM and affect its implementation. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used as an organizational structure to outline the barriers and facilitators to implementation of DM, including: 1) individual characteristics (individual patient characteristics with a focus on groups who may face unique barriers to distress screening and linkage to services), 2) intervention (unique aspects of DM intervention, including specific challenges in screening and psychosocial intervention, with recommendations for resolving these challenges), 3) processes for implementation of DM (modality and timing of screening, the challenge of triage for urgent needs, and incorporation of patient-reported outcomes and quality measures), 4) organization-inner setting (the context of the clinic, hospital, or health care system); and 5) organization-outer setting (including reimbursement strategies and health-care policy). Specific recommendations for evidence-based strategies and interventions for each of the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research are also included to address barriers and challenges.","41":"Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces NSCLC mortality; however, a lack of diversity in LCS studies may limit the generalizability of the results to marginalized groups who face higher risk for and worse outcomes from NSCLC. Identifying sources of inequity in the LCS pipeline is essential to reduce disparities in NSCLC outcomes. The authors searched 3 major databases for studies published from January 1, 2010 to February 27, 2020 that met the following criteria: 1) included screenees between ages 45 and 80 years who were current or former smokers, 2) written in English, 3) conducted in the United States, and 4) discussed socioeconomic and race-based LCS outcomes. Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias. Of 3721 studies screened, 21 were eligible. Eligible studies were evaluated, and their findings were categorized into 3 themes related to LCS disparities faced by Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals: 1) eligibility; 2) utilization, perception, and utility; and 3) postscreening behavior and care. Disparities in LCS exist along racial and socioeconomic lines. There are several steps along the LCS pipeline in which Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals miss the potential benefits of LCS, resulting in increased mortality. This study identified potential sources of inequity that require further investigation. The authors recommend the implementation of prospective trials that evaluate eligibility criteria for underserved groups and the creation of interventions focused on improving utilization and follow-up care to decrease LCS disparities.","42":"Cancer has myriad effects on metabolism that include both rewiring of intracellular metabolism to enable cancer cells to proliferate inappropriately and adapt to the tumor microenvironment, and changes in normal tissue metabolism. With the recognition that fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging is an important tool for the management of many cancers, other metabolites in biological samples have been in the spotlight for cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Metabolomics is the global analysis of small molecule metabolites that like other -omics technologies can provide critical information about the cancer state that are otherwise not apparent. Here, the authors review how cancer and cancer therapies interact with metabolism at the cellular and systemic levels. An overview of metabolomics is provided with a focus on currently available technologies and how they have been applied in the clinical and translational research setting. The authors also discuss how metabolomics could be further leveraged in the future to improve the management of patients with cancer.","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"Although significant improvements have been made in the outcomes of children with cancer, the pace of improvement has slowed in recent years as the limits of therapy intensification may have been reached for many pediatric cancers. Furthermore, with increasing numbers of pediatric cancer survivors, the long-term side effects of treatment have become increasingly apparent. Therefore, attention has shifted to the use of molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapies to improve the outcomes of children who are not cured by traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies and to decrease exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and reduce late effects. This review describes the recent progress in the treatment of children with cancer, focusing in particular on diseases in which targeted and immunotherapeutic agents have made an impact.","47":"The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging for all cancer sites has been periodically updated as a published manual for many years. The last update, the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual went into use on January 1, 2018. The AJCC has since restructured and updated its processes, and all AJCC staging-related data are now housed on its new application programming interface. Consequently, the next AJCC TNM staging update, AJCC version 9 TNM staging, will be published electronically and will be released chapter by chapter. The first chapter of version 9 AJCC TNM staging is the updated cervical cancer staging, which is now published. This article highlights the changes to the AJCC TNM cervical cancer staging; these changes align with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging. The most important of the changes are: 1) the incorporation of imaging and surgical findings, 2) the elimination of lateral spread from T1a, 3) the addition of a subcategory to T1b (T1b3), and 4) histopathology is updated to reflect human papillomavirus-associated and human papillomavirus-independent carcinomas.","48":"Gastric cancer is not a top-10 malignancy in the United States but represents one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide. Biological differences between tumors from Eastern and Western countries add to the complexity of identifying standard-of-care therapy based on international trials. Systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy all have proven efficacy in gastric adenocarcinoma; therefore, multidisciplinary treatment is paramount to treatment selection. Triplet chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer is now accepted and could represent a plateau of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for localized disease. Classification of gastric cancer based on molecular subtypes is providing an opportunity for personalized therapy. Biomarkers, in particular microsatellite instability (MSI), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), tumor mutation burden, and Epstein-Barr virus, are increasingly driving systemic therapy approaches and allowing for the identification of populations most likely to benefit from immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Significant research opportunities remain for the less differentiated histologic subtypes of gastric adenocarcinoma and those without markers of immunotherapy activity.","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied &lt;2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.","53":"","54":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence. Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8% to 4.4% in women, and from 2.4% to 5% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2%-2.3%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2-year relative survival increased from 34% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5% to 6% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14% to 15%. Improved treatment accelerated progress against lung cancer and drove a record drop in overall cancer mortality, despite slowing momentum for other common cancers.","55":"We are experiencing a revolution in cancer. Advances in screening, targeted and immune therapies, big data, computational methodologies, and significant new knowledge of cancer biology are transforming the ways in which we prevent, detect, diagnose, treat, and survive cancer. These advances are enabling durable progress in the goal to achieve personalized cancer care. Despite these gains, more work is needed to develop better tools and strategies to limit cancer as a major health concern. One persistent gap is the inconsistent coordination among researchers and caregivers to implement evidence-based programs that rely on a fuller understanding of the molecular, cellular, and systems biology mechanisms underpinning different types of cancer. Here, the authors integrate conversations with over 90 leading cancer experts to highlight current challenges, encourage a robust and diverse national research portfolio, and capture timely opportunities to advance evidence-based approaches for all patients with cancer and for all communities.","56":"Sexual function is a vital aspect of quality of life among adolescent and young adult (AYA) (ages 15-39 years) cancer survivors. Sexual function encompasses physical, psychosocial, and developmental factors that contribute to sexual health, all of which may be negatively impacted by cancer and treatment. However, limited information is available to inform the care of AYA cancer survivors in this regard. This scoping review, conducted by the Children's Oncology Group AYA Oncology Discipline Committee, summarizes available literature regarding sexual function among AYA cancer survivors, including relevant psychosexual aspects of romantic relationships and body image. Results suggest that, overall, AYA cancer survivors experience a substantial burden of sexual dysfunction. Both physical and psychosocial sequelae influence survivors' sexual health. Interventions to support sexual health and psychosexual adjustment after cancer treatment are needed. Collaborations between the Children's Oncology Group and adult-focused cooperative groups within the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trials Network are warranted to advance prospective assessment of sexual dysfunction and test interventions to improve sexual health among AYA cancer survivors.","57":"Cancer treatment is associated with financial hardship for many patients and families. Screening for financial hardship and referrals to appropriate resources for mitigation are not currently part of most clinical practices. In fact, discussions regarding the cost of treatment occur infrequently in clinical practice. As the cost of cancer treatment continues to rise, the need to mitigate adverse consequences of financial hardship grows more urgent. The introduction of quality measurement and reporting has been successful in establishing standards of care, reducing disparities in receipt of care, and improving other aspects of cancer care outcomes within and across providers. The authors propose the development and adoption of financial hardship screening and management as an additional quality metric for oncology practices. They suggest relevant stakeholders, conveners, and approaches for developing, testing, and implementing a screening and management tool and advocate for endorsement by organizations such as the National Quality Forum and professional societies for oncology care clinicians. The confluence of increasingly high-cost care and widening disparities in ability to pay because of underinsurance and lack of health insurance coverage makes a strong argument to take steps to mitigate the financial consequences of cancer.","58":"","59":"The application of genomic profiling assays using plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly evolving in the management of patients with advanced solid tumors. Diverse plasma ctDNA technologies in both commercial and academic laboratories are in routine or emerging use. The increasing integration of such testing to inform treatment decision making by oncology clinicians has complexities and challenges but holds significant potential to substantially improve patient outcomes. In this review, the authors discuss the current role of plasma ctDNA assays in oncology care and provide an overview of ongoing research that may inform real-world clinical applications in the near future.","60":"Until recently, cancer registries have only collected cancer clinical stage at diagnosis, before any therapy, and pathological stage after surgical resection, provided no treatment has been given before the surgery, but they have not collected stage data after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Because NAT is increasingly being used to treat a variety of tumors, it has become important to make the distinction between both the clinical and the pathological assessment without NAT and the assessment after NAT to avoid any misunderstanding of the significance of the clinical and pathological findings. It also is important that cancer registries collect data after NAT to assess response and effectiveness of this treatment approach on a population basis. The prefix y is used to denote stage after NAT. Currently, cancer registries of the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer only partially collect y stage data, and data on the clinical response to NAT (yc or posttherapy clinical information) are not collected or recorded in a standardized fashion. In addition to NAT, nonoperative management after radiation and chemotherapy is being used with increasing frequency in rectal cancer and may be expanded to other treatment sites. Using examples from breast, rectal, and esophageal cancers, the pathological and imaging changes seen after NAT are reviewed to demonstrate appropriate staging.","61":null,"62":"","63":"","64":"Cancer is a disease of aging and, as the world's population ages, the number of older persons with cancer is increasing and will make up a growing share of the oncology population in virtually every country. Despite this, older patients remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments. Consequently, most of what we know about cancer therapeutics is based on clinical trials conducted in younger, healthier patients, and effective strategies to improve clinical trial participation of older adults with cancer remain sparse. For this systematic review, the authors evaluated published studies regarding barriers to participation and interventions to improve participation of older adults in cancer trials. The quality of the available evidence was low and, despite a literature describing multifaceted barriers, only one intervention study aimed to increase enrollment of older adults in trials. The findings starkly amplify the paucity of evidence-based, effective strategies to improve participation of this underrepresented population in cancer trials. Within these limitations, the authors provide their opinion on how the current cancer research infrastructure must be modified to accommodate the needs of older patients. Several underused solutions are offered to expand clinical trials to include older adults with cancer. However, as currently constructed, these recommendations alone will not solve the evidence gap in geriatric oncology, and efforts are needed to meet older and frail adults where they are by expanding clinical trials designed specifically for this population and leveraging real-world data.","65":"The delivery of cancer care has never changed as rapidly and dramatically as we have seen with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. During the early phase of the pandemic, recommendations for the management of oncology patients issued by various professional societies and government agencies did not recognize the significant regional differences in the impact of the pandemic. California initially experienced lower than expected numbers of cases, and the health care system did not experience the same degree of the burden that had been the case in other parts of the country. In light of promising trends in COVID-19 infections and mortality in California, by late April 2020, discussions were initiated for a phased recovery of full-scale cancer services. However, by July 2020, a surge of cases was reported across the nation, including in California. In this review, the authors share the response and recovery planning experience of the University of California (UC) Cancer Consortium in an effort to provide guidance to oncology practices. The UC Cancer Consortium was established in 2017 to bring together 5 UC Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UC Irvine Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, and the UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. The interventions implemented in each of these cancer centers are highlighted, with a focus on opportunities for a redesign in care delivery models. The authors propose that their experiences gained during this pandemic will enhance pre-pandemic cancer care delivery.","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"Outdoor air pollution is a major contributor to the burden of disease worldwide. Most of the global population resides in places where air pollution levels, because of emissions from industry, power generation, transportation, and domestic burning, considerably exceed the World Health Organization's health-based air-quality guidelines. Outdoor air pollution poses an urgent worldwide public health challenge because it is ubiquitous and has numerous serious adverse human health effects, including cancer. Currently, there is substantial evidence from studies of humans and experimental animals as well as mechanistic evidence to support a causal link between outdoor (ambient) air pollution, and especially particulate matter (PM) in outdoor air, with lung cancer incidence and mortality. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of lung cancer deaths annually worldwide are attributable to PM air pollution. Epidemiological evidence on outdoor air pollution and the risk of other types of cancer, such as bladder cancer or breast cancer, is more limited. Outdoor air pollution may also be associated with poorer cancer survival, although further research is needed. This report presents an overview of outdoor air pollutants, sources, and global levels, as well as a description of epidemiological evidence linking outdoor air pollution with cancer incidence and mortality. Biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis are also described. This report concludes by summarizing public health\/policy recommendations, including multilevel interventions aimed at individual, community, and regional scales. Specific roles for medical and health care communities with regard to prevention and advocacy and recommendations for further research are also described.","70":"Cancer statistics for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (aged 15-39 years) are often presented in aggregate, masking important heterogeneity. The authors analyzed population-based cancer incidence and mortality for AYAs in the United States by age group (ages 15-19, 20-29, and 30-39 years), sex, and race\/ethnicity. In 2020, there will be approximately 89,500 new cancer cases and 9270 cancer deaths in AYAs. Overall cancer incidence increased in all AYA age groups during the most recent decade (2007-2016), largely driven by thyroid cancer, which rose by approximately 3% annually among those aged 20 to 39 years and 4% among those aged 15 to 19 years. Incidence also increased in most age groups for several cancers linked to obesity, including kidney (3% annually across all age groups), uterine corpus (3% in the group aged 20-39 years), and colorectum (0.9%-1.5% in the group aged 20-39 years). Rates declined dramatically for melanoma in the group aged 15 to 29 years (4%-6% annually) but remained stable among those aged 30 to 39 years. Overall cancer mortality declined during 2008 through 2017 by 1% annually across age and sex groups, except for women aged 30 to 39 years, among whom rates were stable because of a flattening of declines in female breast cancer. Rates increased for cancers of the colorectum and uterine corpus in the group aged 30 to 39 years, mirroring incidence trends. Five-year relative survival in AYAs is similar across age groups for all cancers combined (range, 83%-86%) but varies widely for some cancers, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (74% in the group aged 15-19 years vs 51% in the group aged 30-39 years) and brain tumors (77% vs 66%), reflecting differences in histologic subtype distribution and treatment. Progress in reducing cancer morbidity and mortality among AYAs could be addressed through more equitable access to health care, increasing clinical trial enrollment, expanding research, and greater alertness among clinicians and patients for early symptoms and signs of cancer. Further progress could be accelerated with increased disaggregation by age in research on surveillance, etiology, basic biology, and survivorship.","71":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a pandemic of unprecedented proportions in the modern era because of its highly contagious nature and impact on human health and society: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and established CV disease (CVD) are among those initially identified at the highest risk for serious complications, including death. Subsequent studies have pointed out that patients with cancer are also at high risk for a critical disease course. Therefore, the most vulnerable patients are seemingly those with both cancer and CVD, and a careful, unified approach in the evaluation and management of this patient population is especially needed in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an overview of the unique implications of the viral outbreak for the field of cardio-oncology and outlines key modifications in the approach to this ever-increasing patient population. These modifications include a shift toward greater utilization of cardiac biomarkers and a more focused CV imaging approach in the broader context of modifications to typical practice pathways. The goal of this strategic adjustment is to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (or other future viral outbreaks) while not becoming negligent of CVD and its important impact on the overall outcomes of patients who are being treated for cancer.","72":"Onconephrology is a new subspecialty of nephrology that recognizes the important intersections of kidney disease with cancer. This intersection takes many forms and includes drug-induced nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disorders, paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis, and the interactions of chronic kidney disease with cancer. Data clearly demonstrate that, when patients with cancer develop acute or chronic kidney disease, outcomes are inferior, and the promise of curative therapeutic regimens is lessened. This highlights the imperative for collaborative care between oncologists and nephrologists in recognizing and treating kidney disease in patients with cancer. In response to this need, specific training programs in onconephrology as well as dedicated onconephrology clinics have appeared. This comprehensive review covers many of the critical topics in onconephrology, with a focus on acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, drug-induced nephrotoxicity, kidney disease in stem cell transplantation, and electrolyte disorders in patients with cancer.","73":"Immunotherapy has dramatically changed the treatment landscape for patients with cancer. Programmed death-ligand 1\/programmed death-1 checkpoint inhibitors have been in the forefront of this clinical revolution. Currently, there are 6 US Food and Drug Administration-approved checkpoint inhibitors for approximately 18 different histologic types of cancer. Lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are 2 diseases that have led the way in the development of immunotherapy. Atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are all currently used as part of standard-of-care treatment for different stages of lung cancer. Similarly, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have US regulatory approval as treatment for advanced metastatic HNSCC. This is significant because lung cancer represents the most common and most fatal cancer globally, and HNSCC is the sixth most common. Currently, most of the approvals for the use of immunotherapy agents are for patients diagnosed in the metastatic setting. However, research is ongoing to evaluate these drugs in earlier stage disease. There is plausible biological rationale to expect that pharmacologic activation of the immune system will be effective for early-stage and smaller tumors. In addition, selecting patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy and understanding why resistance develops are crucial areas of ongoing research. The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the current immune landscape and future directions in lung cancer and HNSCC.","74":"The management of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) has rapidly evolved over the last 20 years. Major advances have led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of 7 HER2-targeted therapies for the treatment of early-stage and\/or advanced-stage disease. Although oncologic outcomes continue to improve, most patients with advanced HER2-positive BC ultimately die of their disease because of primary or acquired resistance to therapy, and patients with HER2-positive early BC who have residual invasive disease after preoperative systemic therapy are at a higher risk of distant recurrence and death. The concept of treatment de-escalation and escalation is increasingly important to optimally tailor therapy for patients with HER2-positive BC and is a major focus of the current review. Research efforts in this regard are discussed as well as updates regarding the evolving standard of care in the (neo)adjuvant and metastatic settings, including the use of novel combination therapies. The authors also briefly discuss ongoing challenges in the management of HER2-positive BC (eg, intrinsic vs acquired drug resistance, the identification of predictive biomarkers, the integration of imaging techniques to guide clinical practice), and the treatment of HER2-positive brain metastases. Research aimed at superseding these challenges will be imperative to ensure continued progress in the management of HER2-positive BC going forward.","75":"Bladder cancer accounts for nearly 170,000 deaths worldwide annually. For over 4 decades, the systemic management of muscle-invasive and advanced bladder cancer has primarily consisted of platinum-based chemotherapy. Over the past 10 years, innovations in sequencing technologies have led to rapid genomic characterization of bladder cancer, deepening our understanding of bladder cancer pathogenesis and exposing potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. On the basis of its high mutational burden, immune checkpoint inhibitors were investigated in advanced bladder cancer, revealing durable responses in a subset of patients. These agents are now approved for several indications and highlight the changing treatment landscape of advanced bladder cancer. In addition, commonly expressed molecular targets were leveraged to develop targeted therapies, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates. The molecular characterization of bladder cancer and the development of novel therapies also have stimulated investigations into optimizing treatment approaches for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Herein, the authors review the history of muscle-invasive and advanced bladder cancer management, highlight the important molecular characteristics of bladder cancer, describe the major advances in treatment, and offer future directions for therapeutic development.","76":"","77":"","78":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that individuals with a cervix initiate cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and undergo primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred); if primary HPV testing is not available, then individuals aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cotesting (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years (acceptable) (strong recommendation). The ACS recommends that individuals aged &gt;65 years who have no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe disease within the past 25 years, and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years, discontinue all cervical cancer screening (qualified recommendation). These new screening recommendations differ in 4 important respects compared with the 2012 recommendations: 1) The preferred screening strategy is primary HPV testing every 5 years, with cotesting and cytology alone acceptable where access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not yet available; 2) the recommended age to start screening is 25 years rather than 21 years; 3) primary HPV testing, as well as cotesting or cytology alone when primary testing is not available, is recommended starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years; and 4) the guideline is transitional, ie, options for screening with cotesting or cytology alone are provided but should be phased out once full access to primary HPV testing for cervical cancer screening is available without barriers. Evidence related to other relevant issues was reviewed, and no changes were made to recommendations for screening intervals, age or criteria for screening cessation, screening based on vaccination status, or screening after hysterectomy. Follow-up for individuals who screen positive for HPV and\/or cytology should be in accordance with the 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.","79":"","80":"Despite tremendous gains in the molecular understanding of exocrine pancreatic cancer, the prognosis for this disease remains very poor, largely because of delayed disease detection and limited effectiveness of systemic therapies. Both incidence rates and mortality rates for pancreatic cancer have increased during the past decade, in contrast to most other solid tumor types. Recent improvements in multimodality care have substantially improved overall survival, local control, and metastasis-free survival for patients who have localized tumors that are amenable to surgical resection. The widening gap in prognosis between patients with resectable and unresectable or metastatic disease reinforces the importance of detecting pancreatic cancer sooner to improve outcomes. Furthermore, the developing use of therapies that target tumor-specific molecular vulnerabilities may offer improved disease control for patients with advanced disease. Finally, the substantial morbidity associated with pancreatic cancer, including wasting, fatigue, and pain, remains an under-addressed component of this disease, which powerfully affects quality of life and limits tolerance to aggressive therapies. In this article, the authors review the current multidisciplinary standards of care in pancreatic cancer with a focus on emerging concepts in pancreatic cancer detection, precision therapy, and survivorship.","81":"New York City has been at the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has already infected over a million people and resulted in more than 70,000 deaths as of early May 2020 in the United States alone. This rapid and enormous influx of patients into the health care system has had profound effects on all aspects of health care, including the care of patients with cancer. In this report, the authors highlight the transformation they underwent within the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology as they prepared for the COVID-19 crisis in New York City. Under stressful and uncertain conditions, some of the many changes they enacted within their division included developing a regular line of communication among division leaders to ensure the development and implementation of a restructuring strategy, completely reconfiguring the inpatient and outpatient units, rapidly developing the ability to perform telemedicine video visits, and creating new COVID-rule-out and COVID-positive clinics for their patients. These changes allowed them to manage the storm while minimizing the disruption of important continuity of care to their patients with cancer. The authors hope that their experiences will be helpful to other oncology practices about to experience their own individual COVID-19 crises.","82":"","83":null,"84":"","85":"Uptake of colorectal cancer screening remains suboptimal. Mailed fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) offers promise for increasing screening rates, but optimal strategies for implementation have not been well synthesized. In June 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting of subject matter experts and stakeholders to answer key questions regarding mailed FIT implementation in the United States. Points of agreement included: 1) primers, such as texts, telephone calls, and printed mailings before mailed FIT, appear to contribute to effectiveness; 2) invitation letters should be brief and easy to read, and the signatory should be tailored based on setting; 3) instructions for FIT completion should be simple and address challenges that may lead to failed laboratory processing, such as notation of collection date; 4) reminders delivered to initial noncompleters should be used to increase the FIT return rate; 5) data infrastructure should identify eligible patients and track each step in the outreach process, from primer delivery through abnormal FIT follow-up; 6) protocols and procedures such as navigation should be in place to promote colonoscopy after abnormal FIT; 7) a high-quality, 1-sample FIT should be used; 8) sustainability requires a program champion and organizational support for the work, including sufficient funding and external policies (such as quality reporting requirements) to drive commitment to program investment; and 9) the cost effectiveness of mailed FIT has been established. Participants concluded that mailed FIT is an effective and efficient strategy with great potential for increasing colorectal cancer screening in diverse health care settings if more widely implemented.","86":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes the Diet and Physical Activity Guideline to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and, ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among Americans. This guideline is developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and reflects the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The ACS guideline focuses on recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or creates barriers to healthy behaviors. Therefore, this committee presents recommendations for community action to accompany the 4 recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. These recommendations for community action recognize that a supportive social and physical environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. This 2020 ACS guideline is consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.","87":"","88":"Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. Overall, the prognosis for patients with this disease is poor, with a median survival of &lt;2 years. There is a slight predominance in males, and incidence increases with age. The standard approach to therapy in the newly diagnosed setting includes surgery followed by concurrent radiotherapy with temozolomide and further adjuvant temozolomide. Tumor-treating fields, delivering low-intensity alternating electric fields, can also be given concurrently with adjuvant temozolomide. At recurrence, there is no standard of care; however, surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy with chemotherapy or bevacizumab are all potential options, depending on the patient's circumstances. Supportive and palliative care remain important considerations throughout the disease course in the multimodality approach to management. The recently revised classification of glioblastoma based on molecular profiling, notably isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, is a result of enhanced understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of disease. There is a clear need for better therapeutic options, and there have been substantial efforts exploring immunotherapy and precision oncology approaches. In contrast to other solid tumors, however, biological factors, such as the blood-brain barrier and the unique tumor and immune microenvironment, represent significant challenges in the development of novel therapies. Innovative clinical trial designs with biomarker-enrichment strategies are needed to ultimately improve the outcome of patients with glioblastoma.","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"Patient-generated health data (PGHD), or health-related data gathered from patients to help address a health concern, are used increasingly in oncology to make regulatory decisions and evaluate quality of care. PGHD include self-reported health and treatment histories, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and biometric sensor data. Advances in wireless technology, smartphones, and the Internet of Things have facilitated new ways to collect PGHD during clinic visits and in daily life. The goal of the current review was to provide an overview of the current clinical, regulatory, technological, and analytic landscape as it relates to PGHD in oncology research and care. The review begins with a rationale for PGHD as described by the US Food and Drug Administration, the Institute of Medicine, and other regulatory and scientific organizations. The evidence base for clinic-based and remote symptom monitoring using PGHD is described, with an emphasis on PROs. An overview is presented of current approaches to digital phenotyping or device-based, real-time assessment of biometric, behavioral, self-report, and performance data. Analytic opportunities regarding PGHD are envisioned in the context of big data and artificial intelligence in medicine. Finally, challenges and solutions for the integration of PGHD into clinical care are presented. The challenges include electronic medical record integration of PROs and biometric data, analysis of large and complex biometric data sets, and potential clinic workflow redesign. In addition, there is currently more limited evidence for the use of biometric data relative to PROs. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of PGHD make them increasingly likely to be integrated into oncology research and clinical care.","93":"Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare tumors that account for 1% of all adult malignancies, with over 100 different histologic subtypes occurring predominately in the trunk, extremity, and retroperitoneum. This low incidence is further complicated by their variable presentation, behavior, and long-term outcomes, which emphasize the importance of centralized care in specialized centers with a multidisciplinary team approach. In the last decade, there has been an effort to improve the quality of care for patients with STS based on anatomic site and histology, and multiple ongoing clinical trials are focusing on tailoring therapy to histologic subtype. This report summarizes the latest evidence guiding the histiotype-specific management of extremity\/truncal and retroperitoneal STS with regard to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.","94":"","95":"","96":"Lack of health insurance coverage is strongly associated with poor cancer outcomes in the United States. The uninsured are less likely to have access to timely and effective cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life care than their counterparts with health insurance coverage. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law, representing the largest change to health care delivery in the United States since the introduction of the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 1965. The primary goals of the ACA are to improve health insurance coverage, the quality of care, and patient outcomes, and to maintain or lower costs by catalyzing changes in the health care delivery system. In this review, we describe the main components of the ACA, including health insurance expansions, coverage reforms, and delivery system reforms, provisions within these components, and their relevance to cancer screening and early detection, care, and outcomes. We then highlight selected, well-designed studies examining the effects of the ACA provisions on coverage, access to cancer care, and disparities throughout the cancer control continuum. Finally, we identify research gaps to inform evaluation of current and emerging health policies related to cancer outcomes.","97":null,"98":"","99":"","100":"Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death, with numbers greatly exceeding those for human immunodeficiency virus\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. Limited access to timely diagnosis, to affordable, effective treatment, and to high-quality care are just some of the factors that lead to disparities in cancer survival between countries and within countries. In this article, the authors consider various factors that prevent access to cancer medicines (particularly access to essential cancer medicines). Even if an essential cancer medicine is included on a national medicines list, cost might preclude its use, it might be prescribed or used inappropriately, weak infrastructure might prevent it being accessed by those who could benefit, or quality might not be guaranteed. Potential strategies to address the access problems are discussed, including universal health coverage for essential cancer medicines, fairer methods for pricing cancer medicines, reducing development costs, optimizing regulation, and improving reliability in the global supply chain. Optimizing schedules for cancer therapy could reduce not only costs, but also adverse events, and improve access. More and better biomarkers are required to target patients who are most likely to benefit from cancer medicines. The optimum use of cancer medicines depends on the effective delivery of several services allied to oncology (including laboratory, imaging, surgery, and radiotherapy). Investment is necessary in all aspects of cancer care, from these supportive services to technologies, and the training of health care workers and other staff.","101":"With advancements in biomarkers and momentum in precision medicine, biomarker-guided trials such as basket trials and umbrella trials have been developed under the master protocol framework. A master protocol refers to a single, overarching design developed to evaluate multiple hypotheses with the general goal of improving the efficiency of trial evaluation. One type of master protocol is the basket trial, in which a targeted therapy is evaluated for multiple diseases that share common molecular alterations or risk factors that may help predict whether the patients will respond to the given therapy. Another variant of a master protocol is the umbrella trial, in which multiple targeted therapies are evaluated for a single disease that is stratified into multiple subgroups based on different molecular or other predictive risk factors. Both designs follow the core principle of precision medicine-to tailor intervention strategies based on the patient's risk factor(s) that can help predict whether they will respond to a specific treatment. There have been increasing numbers of basket and umbrella trials, but they are still poorly understood. This article reviews common characteristics of basket and umbrella trials, key trials and recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals for precision oncology, and important considerations for clinical readers when critically evaluating future publications on basket trials and umbrella trials and for researchers when designing these clinical trials.","102":"","103":"","104":"Cancer immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapy, manipulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. These therapies have the potential to induce durable responses in multiple solid and hematologic malignancies and thus have transformed treatment algorithms for numerous tumor types. Cancer immunotherapies lead to unique toxicity profiles distinct from the toxicities of other cancer therapies, depending on their mechanism of action. These toxicities often require specific management, which can include steroids and immune-modulating therapy and for which consensus guidelines have been published. This review will focus on the toxicities of checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, including pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.","105":null,"106":null,"107":"","108":"","109":"Although cancer mortality rates declined in the United States in recent decades, some populations experienced little benefit from advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship care. In fact, some cancer disparities between populations of low and high socioeconomic status widened during this period. Many potentially preventable cancer deaths continue to occur, and disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden. Reducing the burden of cancer and eliminating cancer-related disparities will require more focused and coordinated action across multiple sectors and in partnership with communities. This article, part of the American Cancer Society's Cancer Control Blueprint series, introduces a framework for understanding and addressing social determinants to advance cancer health equity and presents actionable recommendations for practice, research, and policy. The article aims to accelerate progress toward eliminating disparities in cancer and achieving health equity.","110":"Multiple organizations around the world have issued evidence-based exercise guidance for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. Recently, the American College of Sports Medicine has updated its exercise guidance for cancer prevention as well as for the prevention and treatment of a variety of cancer health-related outcomes (eg, fatigue, anxiety, depression, function, and quality of life). Despite these guidelines, the majority of people living with and beyond cancer are not regularly physically active. Among the reasons for this is a lack of clarity on the part of those who work in oncology clinical settings of their role in assessing, advising, and referring patients to exercise. The authors propose using the American College of Sports Medicine's Exercise Is Medicine initiative to address this practice gap. The simple proposal is for clinicians to assess, advise, and refer patients to either home-based or community-based exercise or for further evaluation and intervention in outpatient rehabilitation. To do this will require care coordination with appropriate professionals as well as change in the behaviors of clinicians, patients, and those who deliver the rehabilitation and exercise programming. Behavior change is one of many challenges to enacting the proposed practice changes. Other implementation challenges include capacity for triage and referral, the need for a program registry, costs and compensation, and workforce development. In conclusion, there is a call to action for key stakeholders to create the infrastructure and cultural adaptations needed so that all people living with and beyond cancer can be as active as is possible for them.","111":null,"112":"This article is the American Cancer Society's biennial update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Over the most recent 5-year period (2012-2016), the breast cancer incidence rate increased slightly by 0.3% per year, largely because of rising rates of local stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, the breast cancer death rate continues to decline, dropping 40% from 1989 to 2017 and translating to 375,900 breast cancer deaths averted. Notably, the pace of the decline has slowed from an annual decrease of 1.9% during 1998 through 2011 to 1.3% during 2011 through 2017, largely driven by the trend in white women. Consequently, the black-white disparity in breast cancer mortality has remained stable since 2011 after widening over the past 3 decades. Nevertheless, the death rate remains 40% higher in blacks (28.4 vs 20.3 deaths per 100,000) despite a lower incidence rate (126.7 vs 130.8); this disparity is magnified among black women aged &lt;50 years, who have a death rate double that of whites. In the most recent 5-year period (2013-2017), the death rate declined in Hispanics (2.1% per year), blacks (1.5%), whites (1.0%), and Asians\/Pacific Islanders (0.8%) but was stable in American Indians\/Alaska Natives. However, by state, breast cancer mortality rates are no longer declining in Nebraska overall; in Colorado and Wisconsin in black women; and in Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia in white women. Breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in women (surpassing lung cancer) in four Southern and two Midwestern states among blacks and in Utah among whites during 2016-2017. Declines in breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment services to all women.","113":"","114":"","115":null,"116":"Brachytherapy is a specific form of radiotherapy consisting of the precise placement of radioactive sources directly into or next to the tumor.

It is an optimal tool for delivering very high doses to the tumor focally while minimizing the probability of normal tissue complications. Physicians from a wide range of specialties may be involved in either the referral to or the placement of brachytherapy. Many patients require brachytherapy as either primary treatment or as part of their oncologic care. On the basis of high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials, brachytherapy is mainly indicated: 1) as standard in combination with chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer; 2) in surgically treated patients with uterine endometrial cancer for decreasing the risk of vaginal vault recurrence; 3) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer to perform dose escalation and improve progression-free survival; and 4) in patients with breast cancer as adjuvant, accelerated partial breast irradiation or to boost the tumor bed. In this review, the authors discuss the clinical relevance of brachytherapy with a focus on indications, levels of evidence, and results in the overall context of radiation use for patients with cancer.","117":"Tools have been developed to facilitate communication and support information exchange between people diagnosed with cancer and their physicians. Patient-reported outcome measures, question prompt lists, patient-held records, tape recordings of consultations, decision aids, and survivorship care plans have all been promoted as potential tools, and there is extensive literature exploring their impact on patient outcomes. Eleven systematic reviews of studies evaluating tools to facilitate patient-physician communication were reviewed and summarized in this overview of systematic reviews. Across the systematic reviews, 87 publications reported on 84 primary studies involving 15,381 participants. Routine use of patient-reported outcome measures and feedback of results to clinicians can improve pain management, physician-patient communication, and symptom detection and control; increase utilization of supportive care; and increase patient involvement in care. Question prompt lists can increase the number of questions asked by patients without increasing consultation length and may encourage them to reflect and plan questions before the consultation. There is limited benefit in audio recording consultations or using patient-held records during consultations. Physicians should be supported by adequately resourced health services to respond effectively to the range of clinical and broader patient needs identified through the routine use of tools to facilitate communication.","118":"","119":"","120":"Mesothelioma affects mostly older individuals who have been occupationally exposed to asbestos. The global mesothelioma incidence and mortality rates are unknown, because data are not available from developing countries that continue to use large amounts of asbestos. The incidence rate of mesothelioma has decreased in Australia, the United States, and Western Europe, where the use of asbestos was banned or strictly regulated in the 1970s and 1980s, demonstrating the value of these preventive measures. However, in these same countries, the overall number of deaths from mesothelioma has not decreased as the size of the population and the percentage of old people have increased. Moreover, hotspots of mesothelioma may occur when carcinogenic fibers that are present in the environment are disturbed as rural areas are being developed. Novel immunohistochemical and molecular markers have improved the accuracy of diagnosis; however, about 14% (high-resource countries) to 50% (developing countries) of mesothelioma diagnoses are incorrect, resulting in inadequate treatment and complicating epidemiological studies. The discovery that germline BRCA1-asssociated protein 1 (BAP1) mutations cause mesothelioma and other cancers (BAP1 cancer syndrome) elucidated some of the key pathogenic mechanisms, and treatments targeting these molecular mechanisms and\/or modulating the immune response are being tested. The role of surgery in pleural mesothelioma is controversial as it is difficult to predict who will benefit from aggressive management, even when local therapies are added to existing or novel systemic treatments. Treatment outcomes are improving, however, for peritoneal mesothelioma. Multidisciplinary international collaboration will be necessary to improve prevention, early detection, and treatment.","121":null,"122":"The world of molecular profiling has undergone revolutionary changes over the last few years as knowledge, technology, and even standard clinical practice have evolved. Broad molecular profiling is now nearly essential for all patients with metastatic solid tumors. New agents have been approved based on molecular testing instead of tumor site of origin. Molecular profiling methodologies have likewise changed such that tests that were performed on patients a few years ago are no longer complete and possibly inaccurate today. As with all rapid change, medical providers can quickly fall behind or struggle to find up-to-date sources to ensure he or she provides optimum care. In this review, the authors provide the current state of the art for molecular profiling\/precision medicine, practice standards, and a view into the future ahead.","123":"Ovarian cancer is the second most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in women around the world. The outcomes are complicated, because the disease is often diagnosed late and composed of several subtypes with distinct biological and molecular properties (even within the same histological subtype), and there is inconsistency in availability of and access to treatment. Upfront treatment largely relies on debulking surgery to no residual disease and platinum-based chemotherapy, with the addition of antiangiogenic agents in patients who have suboptimally debulked and stage IV disease. Major improvement in maintenance therapy has been seen by incorporating inhibitors against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) molecules involved in the DNA damage-repair process, which have been approved in a recurrent setting and recently in a first-line setting among women with BRCA1\/BRCA2 mutations. In recognizing the challenges facing the treatment of ovarian cancer, current investigations are enlaced with deep molecular and cellular profiling. To improve survival in this aggressive disease, access to appropriate evidence-based care is requisite. In concert, realizing individualized precision medicine will require prioritizing clinical trials of innovative treatments and refining predictive biomarkers that will enable selection of patients who would benefit from chemotherapy, targeted agents, or immunotherapy. Together, a coordinated and structured approach will accelerate significant clinical and academic advancements in ovarian cancer and meaningfully change the paradigm of care.","124":"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, and its incidence is rising. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of endometrial cancer biology, many aspects of treatment remain mired in controversy, including the role of surgical lymph node assessment and the selection of patients for adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. For the subset of women with microsatellite-instable, metastatic disease, anti- programmed cell death protein 1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and numerous trials are attempting to build on this early success.","125":"A summary evaluation of the 2015 American Cancer Society (ACS) challenge goal showed that overall US mortality from all cancers combined declined 26% over the period from 1990 to 2015. Recent research suggests that US cancer mortality can still be lowered considerably by applying known interventions broadly and equitably. The ACS Board of Directors, therefore, commissioned ACS researchers to determine challenge goals for reductions in cancer mortality by 2035. A statistical model was used to estimate the average annual percent decline in overall cancer death rates among the US general population and among college-educated Americans during the most recent period. Then, the average annual percent decline in the overall cancer death rates of college graduates was applied to the death rates in the general population to project future rates in the United States beginning in 2020. If overall cancer death rates from 2020 through 2035 nationally decline at the pace of those of college graduates, then death rates in 2035 in the United States will drop by 38.3% from the 2015 level and by 54.4% from the 1990 level. On the basis of these results, the ACS 2035 challenge goal was set as a 40% reduction from the 2015 level. Achieving this goal could lead to approximately 1.3 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred from 2020 through 2035 and 122,500 fewer cancer deaths in 2035 alone. The results also show that reducing the prevalence of risk factors and achieving optimal adherence to evidence-based screening guidelines by 2025 could lead to a 33.5% reduction in the overall cancer death rate by 2035, attaining 85% of the challenge goal.","126":"","127":"","128":"Each year, the American Cancer Society publishes a summary of its guidelines for early cancer detection, data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening.

An approach that triages patients to personalized follow-up care pathways, depending on the type(s) and level(s) of resources needed for patients' long-term care, is in use in the United Kingdom and other countries and has been shown to meet patients' needs, more efficiently use the health care system, and reduce costs. Recognizing that testing and implementing a similar personalized approach to cancer follow-up care in the United States will require a multipronged strategy, the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology convened a summit in January 2018 to identify the needed steps to move this work from concept to implementation. The summit identified 4 key strategies going forward: 1) developing a candidate model (or models) of care delivery; 2) building the case for implementation by conducting studies modeling the effects of personalized pathways of follow-up care on patient outcomes, workforce and health care resources, and utilization and costs; 3) creating consensus-based guidelines to guide the delivery of personalized care pathways; and 4) identifying and filling research gaps to develop and implement needed care changes. While these national strategies are pursued, oncology and primary care providers can lay the groundwork for implementation by assessing their patients' risk of recurrence and the chronic and late effects of cancer as well as other health care needs and resources available for care and by considering triaging patients accordingly, referring patients to appropriate specialized survivorship clinics as these are developed, helping to support patients who are capable of self-managing their health, setting expectations with patients from diagnosis onward for the need for follow-up in primary care and\/or a survivorship clinic, and improving coordination of care between oncology and primary care.","132":"","133":"Between 1991 and 2015, the cancer mortality rate declined dramatically in the United States, reflecting improvements in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship care. However, cancer outcomes in the United States vary substantially between populations defined by race\/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and geographic area of residence. Many potentially preventable cancer deaths occur in individuals who did not receive effective cancer prevention, screening, treatment, or survivorship care. At the same time, cancer care spending is large and growing, straining national, state, health insurance plans, and family budgets. Indeed, one of the most pressing issues in American medicine is how to ensure that all populations, in every community, derive the benefit from scientific research that has already been completed. Addressing these questions from the perspective of health care delivery is necessary to accelerate the decline in cancer mortality that began in the early 1990s. This article, part of the Cancer Control Blueprint series, describes challenges with the provision of care across the cancer control continuum in the United States. It also identifies goals for a high-performing health system that could reduce disparities and the burden of cancer by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles; access to a regular source of primary care; timely access to evidence-based care; patient-centeredness, including effective patient-provider communication; enhanced coordination and communication between providers, including primary care and specialty care providers; and affordability for patients, payers, and society.","134":null,"135":"Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.","136":"","137":"","138":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival.

Mortality data, available through 2016, were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2006-2015) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2% per year in men, whereas the cancer death rate (2007-2016) declined annually by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively. The overall cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2016 by a total of 27%, translating into approximately 2,629,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the racial gap in cancer mortality is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic inequalities are widening, with the most notable gaps for the most preventable cancers. For example, compared with the most affluent counties, mortality rates in the poorest counties were 2-fold higher for cervical cancer and 40% higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012-2016. Some states are home to both the wealthiest and the poorest counties, suggesting the opportunity for more equitable dissemination of effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies. A broader application of existing cancer control knowledge with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups would undoubtedly accelerate progress against cancer.","139":null,"140":"","141":"","142":"Despite research explicating the benefits of cancer rehabilitation interventions to optimize physical, social, emotional, and vocational functioning, many reports document low rates of referral to and uptake of rehabilitation in oncology. Cancer rehabilitation clinicians, researchers, and policy makers could learn from the multidisciplinary specialty of palliative care, which has benefited from a growth strategy and has garnered national recognition as an important and necessary aspect of oncology care. The purpose of this article is to explore the actions that have increased the uptake and integration of palliative care to yield insights and multimodal strategies for the development and growth of cancer rehabilitation. After examining the history of palliative care and its growth, the authors highlight 5 key strategies that may benefit the field of cancer rehabilitation: 1) stimulating the science in specific gap areas; 2) creating clinical practice guidelines; 3) building clinical capacity; 4) ascertaining and responding to public opinion; and 5) advocating for public policy change. Coordinated and simultaneous advances on these 5 strategies may catalyze the growth, utilization, and effectiveness of patient screening, timely referrals, and delivery of appropriate cancer rehabilitation care that reduces disability and improves quality of life for cancer survivors who need these services.","143":"From the mid-20th century, accumulating evidence has supported the introduction of screening for cancers of the cervix, breast, colon and rectum, prostate (via shared decisions), and lung. The opportunity to detect and treat precursor lesions and invasive disease at a more favorable stage has contributed substantially to reduced incidence, morbidity, and mortality. However, as new discoveries portend advancements in technology and risk-based screening, we fail to fulfill the greatest potential of the existing technology, in terms of both full access among the target population and the delivery of state-of-the art care at each crucial step in the cascade of events that characterize successful cancer screening. There also is insufficient commitment to invest in the development of new technologies, incentivize the development of new ideas, and rapidly evaluate promising new technology. In this report, the authors summarize the status of cancer screening and propose a blueprint for the nation to further advance the contribution of screening to cancer control.","144":"Cancer care delivery is being shaped by growing numbers of cancer survivors coupled with provider shortages, rising costs of primary treatment and follow-up care, significant survivorship health disparities, increased reliance on informal caregivers, and the transition to value-based care. These factors create a compelling need to provide coordinated, comprehensive, personalized care for cancer survivors in ways that meet survivors' and caregivers' unique needs while minimizing the impact of provider shortages and controlling costs for health care systems, survivors, and families. The authors reviewed research identifying and addressing the needs of cancer survivors and caregivers and used this synthesis to create a set of critical priorities for care delivery, research, education, and policy to equitably improve survivor outcomes and support caregivers. Efforts are needed in 3 priority areas: 1) implementing routine assessment of survivors' needs and functioning and caregivers' needs; 2) facilitating personalized, tailored, information and referrals from diagnosis onward for both survivors and caregivers, shifting services from point of care to point of need wherever possible; and 3) disseminating and supporting the implementation of new care methods and interventions.","145":"Locoregional recurrence negatively impacts both long-term survival and quality of life for several malignancies. For appropriate-risk patients with an isolated, resectable, local recurrence, surgery represents the only potentially curative therapy. However, oncologic outcomes remain inferior for patients with locally recurrent disease even after macroscopically complete resection. Unfortunately, these operations are often extensive, with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. This review highlights selected malignancies (mesothelioma, sarcoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, rectal cancer, and peritoneal surface malignancies) in which surgical resection is a key treatment modality and local recurrence plays a significant role in overall oncologic outcome with regard to survival and quality of life. For each type of cancer, the current, state-of-the-art treatment strategies and their outcomes are assessed. The need for additional therapeutic options is presented given the limitations of the current standard therapies. New and emerging treatment modalities, including polymer films and nanoparticles, are highlighted as potential future solutions for both prevention and treatment of locally recurrent cancers. Finally, the authors identify additional clinical and research opportunities and propose future research strategies based on the various patterns of local recurrence among the different cancers.","146":"","147":"In the United States, it is estimated that more than 1.7 million people will be diagnosed with cancer, and more than 600,000 will die of the disease in 2018. The financial costs associated with cancer risk factors and cancer care are enormous. To substantially reduce both the number of individuals diagnosed with and dying from cancer and the costs associated with cancer each year in the United States, government and industry and the public health, medical, and scientific communities must work together to develop, invest in, and implement comprehensive cancer control goals and strategies at the national level and expand ongoing initiatives at the state and local levels. This report is the second in a series of articles in this journal that, together, describe trends in cancer rates and the scientific evidence on cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship to inform the identification of priorities for a comprehensive cancer control plan.

Although surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment for localized tumors, systemic treatment options for patients with metastatic NETs have expanded considerably. Somatostatin analogs have demonstrated both antisecretory and antitumor efficacy. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with lutetium-177 dotatate (177 Lu-DOTATATE) has been approved for advanced GEP-NETs. The antitumor activity of everolimus has been demonstrated across a wide spectrum of NETs, and the antiangiogenic agent sunitinib has been approved for pancreatic NETs (pNETs). Chemotherapy with temozolomide and capecitabine has recently demonstrated an unprecedented prolongation of progression-free survival in a randomized trial of pNETs.

In addition, more than 3 million Hispanic Americans live in the US territory of Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanics in the United States based on data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time, contemporary incidence and mortality rates for Puerto Rico, which has a 99% Hispanic population, are also presented. An estimated 149,100 new cancer cases and 42,700 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2018. For all cancers combined, Hispanics have 25% lower incidence and 30% lower mortality compared with non-Hispanic whites, although rates of infection-related cancers, such as liver, are up to twice as high in Hispanics. However, these aggregated data mask substantial heterogeneity within the Hispanic population because of variable cancer risk, as exemplified by the substantial differences in the cancer burden between island Puerto Ricans and other US Hispanics. For example, during 2011 to 2015, prostate cancer incidence rates in Puerto Rico (146.6 per 100,000) were 60% higher than those in other US Hispanics combined (91.6 per 100,000) and 44% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (101.7 per 100,000). Prostate cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death among men in Puerto Rico, accounting for nearly 1 in 6 cancer deaths during 2011-2015, whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among other US Hispanic men combined. Variations in cancer risk are driven by differences in exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents and behavioral risk factors as well as the prevalence of screening. Strategies for reducing cancer risk in Hispanic populations include targeted, culturally appropriate interventions for increasing the uptake of preventive services and reducing cancer risk factor prevalence, as well as additional funding for Puerto Rico-specific and subgroup-specific cancer research and surveillance.","152":"Over the past decade, a large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the integration of palliative care into oncology practice for patients with advanced cancer. The question is no longer whether palliative care should be offered, but what is the optimal model of delivery, when is the ideal time to refer, who is in greatest need of a referral, and how much palliative care should oncologists themselves be providing. These questions are particularly relevant given the scarcity of palliative care resources internationally. In this state-of-the-science review directed at the practicing cancer clinician, the authors first discuss the contemporary literature examining the impact of specialist palliative care on various health outcomes. Then, conceptual models are provided to support team-based, timely, and targeted palliative care. Team-based palliative care allows the interdisciplinary members to address comprehensively the multidimensional care needs of patients and their caregivers. Timely palliative care, at its best, is preventive care to minimize crises at the end of life. Targeted palliative care involves identifying the patients most likely to benefit from specialist palliative care interventions, akin to the concept of targeted cancer therapies. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of innovative care models, such as outpatient clinics, embedded clinics, nurse-led palliative care, primary palliative care provided by oncology teams, and automatic referral, are summarized. Moving forward, more research is needed to determine how different health systems can best personalize palliative care to provide the right level of intervention, for the right patient, in the right setting, at the right time.

In this review, key applications and new directions are outlined for translating the cancer genome and transcriptome into patient care in the clinic.","273":"In this article, the American Cancer Society provides an overview of female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Approximately 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 40,290 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2015. Breast cancer incidence rates increased among non-Hispanic black (black) and Asian\/Pacific Islander women and were stable among non-Hispanic white (white), Hispanic, and American Indian\/Alaska Native women from 2008 to 2012. Although white women have historically had higher incidence rates than black women, in 2012, the rates converged. Notably, during 2008 through 2012, incidence rates were significantly higher in black women compared with white women in 7 states, primarily located in the South. From 1989 to 2012, breast cancer death rates decreased by 36%, which translates to 249,000 breast cancer deaths averted in the United States over this period. This decrease in death rates was evident in all racial\/ethnic groups except American Indians\/Alaska Natives. However, the mortality disparity between black and white women nationwide has continued to widen; and, by 2012, death rates were 42% higher in black women than in white women. During 2003 through 2012, breast cancer death rates declined for white women in all 50 states; but, for black women, declines occurred in 27 of 30 states that had sufficient data to analyze trends. In 3 states (Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin), breast cancer death rates in black women were stable during 2003 through 2012. Widening racial disparities in breast cancer mortality are likely to continue, at least in the short term, in view of the increasing trends in breast cancer incidence rates in black women.","274":"An estimated 60,290 new cases of breast carcinoma in situ are expected to be diagnosed in 2015, and approximately 1 in 33 women is likely to receive an in situ breast cancer diagnosis in her lifetime. Although in situ breast cancers are relatively common, their clinical significance and optimal treatment are topics of uncertainty and concern for both patients and clinicians. In this article, the American Cancer Society provides information about occurrence and treatment patterns for the 2 major subtypes of in situ breast cancer in the United States-ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ-using data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the 13 oldest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. The authors also present an overview of in situ breast cancer detection, treatment, risk factors, and prevention and discuss research needs and initiatives.","275":"Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics\/Latinos, who represent the largest racial\/ethnic minority group in the United States, accounting for 17.4% (55.4 million\/318 million) of the total US population in 2014. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer statistics for Hispanics based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Among Hispanics in 2015, there will be an estimated 125,900 new cancer cases diagnosed and 37,800 cancer deaths. For all cancers combined, Hispanics have 20% lower incidence rates and 30% lower death rates compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs); however, death rates are slightly higher among Hispanics during adolescence (aged 15-19 years). Hispanic cancer rates vary by country of origin and are generally lowest in Mexicans, with the exception of infection-associated cancers. Liver cancer incidence rates in Hispanic men, which are twice those in NHW men, doubled from 1992 to 2012; however, rates in men aged younger than 50 years declined by 43% since 2003, perhaps a bellwether of future trends for this highly fatal cancer. Variations in cancer risk between Hispanics and NHWs, as well as between subpopulations, are driven by differences in exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents, rates of screening, and lifestyle patterns. Strategies for reducing cancer risk in Hispanic populations include increasing the uptake of preventive services (e.g., screening and vaccination) and targeted interventions to reduce obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption.","276":"","277":"","278":"","279":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women and second leading cause of cancer death when men and women are combined in the United States (US). Almost two-thirds of CRC survivors are living 5 years after diagnosis. Considering the recent decline in both incidence and mortality, the prevalence of CRC survivors is likely to increase dramatically over the coming decades with the increase in rates of CRC screening, further advances in early detection and treatment and the aging and growth of the US population. Survivors are at risk for a CRC recurrence, a new primary CRC, other cancers, as well as both short-term and long-term adverse effects of the CRC and the modalities used to treat it. CRC survivors may also have psychological, reproductive, genetic, social, and employment concerns after treatment. Communication and coordination of care between the treating oncologist and the primary care clinician is critical to effectively and efficiently manage the long-term care of CRC survivors. The guidelines in this article are intended to assist primary care clinicians in delivering risk-based health care for CRC survivors who have completed active therapy.","280":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Screening to detect polyps or cancer at an early stage has been shown to produce better outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Programs with a population-based approach can reach a large majority of the eligible population and can offer cost-effective interventions with the potential benefit of maximizing early cancer detection and prevention using a complete follow-up plan. The purpose of this review was to summarize the key features of population-based programs to increase CRC screening in the United States. A search was conducted in the SCOPUS, OvidSP, and PubMed databases. The authors selected published reports of population-based programs that met at least 5 of the 6 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) criteria for cancer prevention and were known to the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. Interventions at the level of individual practices were not included in this review. IARC cancer prevention criteria served as a framework to assess the effective processes and elements of a population-based program. Eight programs were included in this review. Half of the programs met all IARC criteria, and all programs led to improvements in screening rates. The rate of colonoscopy after a positive stool test was heterogeneous among programs. Different population-based strategies were used to promote these screening programs, including system-based, provider-based, patient-based, and media-based strategies. Treatment of identified cancer cases was not included explicitly in 4 programs but was offered through routine medical care. Evidence-based methods for promoting CRC screening at a population level can guide the development of future approaches in health care prevention. The key elements of a successful population-based approach include adherence to the 6 IARC criteria and 4 additional elements (an identified external funding source, a structured policy for positive fecal occult blood test results and confirmed cancer cases, outreach activities for recruitment and patient education, and an established rescreening process).","281":"The heterogeneity and complexity of advanced cancers strongly support the rationale for an enhanced focus on molecular prevention as a priority strategy to reduce the burden of cancer. Molecular prevention encompasses traditional chemopreventive agents as well as vaccinations and therapeutic approaches to cancer-predisposing conditions. Despite challenges to the field, we now have refined insights into cancer etiology and early pathogenesis; successful risk assessment and new risk models; agents with broad preventive efficacy (eg, aspirin) in common chronic diseases, including cancer; and a successful track record of more than 10 agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of precancerous lesions or cancer risk reduction. The development of molecular preventive agents does not differ significantly from the development of therapies for advanced cancers, yet it has unique challenges and special considerations given that it most often involves healthy or asymptomatic individuals. Agents, biomarkers, cohorts, overall design, and endpoints are key determinants of molecular preventive trials, as with therapeutic trials, although distinctions exist for each within the preventive setting. Progress in the development and evolution of molecular preventive agents has been steadier in some organ systems, such as breast and skin, than in others. In order for molecular prevention to be fully realized as an effective strategy, several challenges to the field must be addressed. Here, the authors provide a brief overview of the context for and special considerations of molecular prevention along with a discussion of the results from major randomized controlled trials.","282":"Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) is the most common malignancy of the head and neck (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). Recent trends have shown a dramatic rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP-SCC), with a marked increase in lesions related to human papillomavirus infection. This update presents the latest evidence regarding OC-SCC and OP-SCC. In particular, the authors compare and contrast tumors at these two sites with respect to epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinicopathologic presentation, clinical assessment, imaging, management, and prognosis. It is important for clinicians to be aware of differences between OC-SCC and OP-SCC so that appropriate patient education and multidisciplinary care can be provided to optimize outcomes.","283":"Knowledge of the cancer burden is important for informing and advocating cancer prevention and control. Mortality data are readily available for states and counties, but not for congressional districts, from which representatives are elected and which may be more influential in compelling legislation and policy. The authors calculated average annual cancer death rates during 2002 to 2011 for each of the 435 congressional districts using mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics and population estimates from the US Census Bureau. Age-standardized death rates were mapped for all sites combined and separately for cancers of the lung and bronchus, colorectum, breast, and prostate by race\/ethnicity and sex. Overall cancer death rates vary by almost 2-fold and are generally lowest in Mountain states and highest in Appalachia and areas of the South. The distribution is similar for lung and colorectal cancers, with the lowest rates consistently noted in districts in Utah. However, for breast and prostate cancers, while the highest rates are again scattered throughout the South, the geographic pattern is less clear and the lowest rates are in Hawaii and southern Texas and Florida. Within-state heterogeneity is limited, particularly for men, with the exceptions of Texas, Georgia, and Florida. Patterns also vary by race\/ethnicity. For example, the highest prostate cancer death rates are in the West and north central United States among non-Hispanic whites, but in the deep South among African Americans. Hispanics have the lowest rates except for colorectal cancer in Wyoming, eastern Colorado, and northern New Mexico. These data can facilitate cancer control and stimulate conversation about the relationship between cancer and policies that influence access to health care and the prevalence of behavioral and environmental risk factors.","284":"This article provides an overview of the current literature on seven cancer sites that may disproportionately affect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender\/transsexual, and queer\/questioning (LGBTQ) populations. For each cancer site, the authors present and discuss the descriptive statistics, primary prevention, secondary prevention and preclinical disease, tertiary prevention and late-stage disease, and clinical implications. Finally, an overview of psychosocial factors related to cancer survivorship is offered as well as strategies for improving access to care.","285":"","286":"","287":"An aging population and advances in diagnostics and treatment have resulted in a rapidly growing population of people impacted by cancer. People live longer after a cancer diagnosis and tolerate more aggressive treatments than in the past. Younger patients struggle with diversions from the normal developmental milestones in career and relationships, while older patients deal with the dual challenges of aging and cancer. Cancer's transition from likely death to survival has increased interest in its impact on psychosocial issues and quality of life, rather than just longevity. In this article, the authors review the psychiatric diagnosis and management of the mental health issues most often encountered in oncology. Oncology treatment teams, including oncologists, nurses, social workers, and other ancillary staff, are often on the front lines of addressing psychiatric distress and clinical syndromes when psychiatrists are not easily available. The purpose of this review article is to highlight opportunities for nonpsychiatrists to improve identification and treatment of psychosocial distress and psychiatric syndromes and to request formal psychiatric consultation in appropriate situations. Psychotherapeutic, psychopharmacologic, cognitive, and behavioral-oriented interventions, as well as supportive interventions, are discussed for treating patients who are facing challenges during active cancer treatment, survivorship, and at the end of life. This review is not exhaustive but highlights the more common psychosomatic medicine and palliative care scenarios that impact cancer patient care. The importance of recognizing and addressing burnout and compassion fatigue in multidisciplinary professionals who care for those treated for cancer is also discussed given the secondary impact this can have on patient care.","288":"","289":"It is well known that there is a significant racial divide in breast cancer incidence and mortality rates. African American women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than white women but are more likely to die from it. This review explores the factors that may contribute to the racial survival disparity. Consideration is paid to what is known about the role of differences in tumor biology, genomics, cancer screening, and quality of cancer care. It is argued that it is the collision of 2 forces, tumor biology and genomics, with patterns of care that leads to the breast cancer mortality gap. The delays, misuse, and underuse of treatment for African American patients are of increased significance when these patients are presenting with more aggressive forms of breast cancer. In the current climate of health care reform ushered in by the Affordable Care Act, this article also evaluates interventions to close the disparity gap. Prior interventions have been too narrowly focused on the patient rather than addressing the system and improving care across the continuum of breast cancer evaluation and treatment. Lastly, areas of future investigation and policy initiatives aimed at reducing the racial survival disparity in breast cancer are discussed.","290":"Since the dissemination of prostate-specific antigen screening, most men with prostate cancer are now diagnosed with localized, low-risk prostate cancer that is unlikely to be lethal. Nevertheless, nearly all of these men undergo primary treatment with surgery or radiation, placing them at risk for longstanding side effects, including erectile dysfunction and impaired urinary function. Active surveillance and other observational strategies (ie, expectant management) have produced excellent long-term disease-specific survival and minimal morbidity for men with prostate cancer. Despite this, expectant management remains underused for men with localized prostate cancer. In this review, various approaches to the expectant management of men with prostate cancer are summarized, including watchful waiting and active surveillance strategies. Contemporary cancer-specific and health care quality-of-life outcomes are described for each of these approaches. Finally, contemporary patterns of use, potential disparities in care, and ongoing research and controversies surrounding expectant management of men with localized prostate cancer are discussed.","291":"Early integration of pediatric palliative care (PPC) for children with life-threatening conditions and their families enhances the provision of holistic care, addressing psychological, social, spiritual, and physical concerns, without precluding treatment with the goal of cure. PPC involvement ideally extends throughout the illness trajectory to improve continuity of care for patients and families. Although current PPC models focus primarily on the hospital setting, community-based PPC (CBPPC) programs are increasingly integral to the coordination, continuity, and provision of quality care. In this review, the authors examine the purpose, design, and infrastructure of CBPPC in the United States, highlighting eligibility criteria, optimal referral models to enhance early involvement, and fundamental tenets of CBPPC. This article also appraises the role of CBPPC in promoting family-centered care. This model strives to enhance shared decision making, facilitate seamless handoffs of care, maintain desired locations of care, and ease the end of life for children who die at home. The effect of legislation on the advent and evolution of CBPPC also is discussed, as is an assessment of the current status of state-specific CBPPC programs and barriers to implementation of CBPPC. Finally, strategies and resources for designing, implementing, and maintaining quality standards in CBPPC programs are reviewed.","292":"","293":"","294":"","295":"Until recently, a diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis was uniformly accompanied by a grim prognosis that was typically measured in weeks to months. Consequently, the management of carcinomatosis revolves largely around palliation of symptoms such as bowel obstruction, nausea, pain, fatigue, and cachexia. A prior lack of effective treatment options created the nihilistic view that currently exists and persists despite improvements in the efficacy of systemic therapy and the evolution of multimodality approaches including surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. This article reviews the evolution and current state of treatment options for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. In addition, it highlights recent advances in understanding the molecular biology of carcinomatosis and the focus of current and future clinical trials. Finally, this article provides practical management options for the palliation of common complications of carcinomatosis. It is hoped that the reader will recognize that carcinomatosis is no longer an imminent death sentence and that through continued research and therapeutic innovation, clinicians can make an even greater impact on this form of metastatic cancer.","296":null,"297":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Evidence regarding cancer-related fatigue (fatigue) has accumulated sufficiently such that recommendations for screening, evaluation, and\/or management have been released recently by 4 leading cancer organizations. These evidence-based fatigue recommendations are available for clinicians, and some have patient versions; but barriers at the patient, clinician, and system levels hinder dissemination and implementation into practice. The underlying biologic mechanisms for this debilitating symptom have not been elucidated completely, hindering the development of mechanistically driven interventions. However, significant progress has been made toward methods for screening and comprehensively evaluating fatigue and other common symptoms using reliable and valid self-report measures. Limited data exist to support the use of any pharmacologic agent; however, several nonpharmacologic interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing fatigue in adults. Never before have evidence-based recommendations for fatigue management been disseminated by 4 premier cancer organizations (the National Comprehensive Cancer, the Oncology Nursing Society, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer\/Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology). Clinicians may ask: Are we ready for implementation into practice? The reply: A variety of approaches to screening, evaluation, and management are ready for implementation. To reduce fatigue severity and distress and its impact on functioning, intensified collaborations and close partnerships between clinicians and researchers are needed, with an emphasis on system-wide efforts to disseminate and implement these evidence-based recommendations.","298":"The outcome for children with cancer has improved significantly over the past 60 years, with greater than 80% of patients today becoming 5-year survivors. Despite this progress, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children in the United States, and significant short-term and long-term treatment toxicities continue to impact the majority of children with cancer. The development of targeted new agents offers the prospect of potentially more effective and less toxic treatment for children. More than a decade since imatinib mesylate was introduced into the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, transforming its outcome, a range of targeted agents has undergone study in pediatric cancer patients. Early lessons learned from these studies include a better understanding of the adverse event profile of these drugs in children, the challenge of developing pediatric-specific formulations, and the continued reliance on successful development for adult cancer indications on pediatric drug development. The collaborative research infrastructure for children with cancer in the United States is well positioned to advance novel treatments into clinical investigations for a spectrum of rare and ultra-rare childhood cancers. A greater investment of resources in target discovery and validation can help drive much needed development of new, more effective treatments for children with cancer.","299":"","300":"","301":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE The importance of expanding cancer treatment to include the promotion of overall long-term health is emphasized in the Institute of Medicine report on delivering quality oncology care. Weight management, physical activity, and a healthy diet are key components of tertiary prevention but may be areas in which the oncologist and\/or the oncology care team may be less familiar. This article reviews current diet and physical activity guidelines, the evidence supporting those recommendations, and provides an overview of practical interventions that have resulted in favorable improvements in lifestyle behavior change in cancer survivors. It also describes current lifestyle practices among cancer survivors and the role of the oncologist in helping cancer patients and survivors embark upon changes in lifestyle behaviors, and it calls for the development of partnerships between oncology providers, primary care providers, and experts in nutrition, exercise science, and behavior change to help positively orient cancer patients toward longer and healthier lives.","302":"Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and\/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight\/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.","303":"","304":"","305":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE The management of squamous cell carcinomas of the anal canal has evolved from surgery as first-line treatment to curative chemoradiation, with surgery reserved for salvage.

Investigations into these medicinal properties has led to the development of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals such as dronabinol, nabilone, and nabiximols. Dronabinol is best studied in the treatment of nausea secondary to cancer chemotherapy and anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for those indications. Nabilone has been best studied for the treatment of nausea secondary to cancer chemotherapy. There are also limited studies of these drugs for other conditions. Nabiximols is only available in the United States through clinical trials, but is used in Canada and the United Kingdom for the treatment of spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis and pain. Studies of marijuana have concentrated on nausea, appetite, and pain. This article will review the literature regarding the medical use of marijuana and these cannabinoid pharmaceuticals (with emphasis on indications relevant to oncology), as well as available information regarding adverse effects of marijuana use.","311":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Over the past few decades, a body of research has emerged confirming what many adult patients with noncentral nervous system cancer have long reported-that cancer and its treatment are frequently associated with cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). The severity of CRCI varies, and symptoms can emerge early or late in the disease course. Nonetheless, CRCI is typically mild to moderate in nature and primarily involves the domains of memory, attention, executive functioning, and processing speed. Animal models and novel neuroimaging techniques have begun to unravel the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying CRCI, including the role of inflammatory cascades, direct neurotoxic effects, damage to progenitor cells, white matter abnormalities, and reduced functional connectivity, among others. Given the paucity of research on CRCI with other cancer populations, this review synthesizes the current literature with a deliberate focus on CRCI within the context of breast cancer. A hypothetical case-study approach is used to illustrate how CRCI often presents clinically and how current science can inform practice. While the literature regarding intervention for CRCI is nascent, behavioral and pharmacologic approaches are discussed.","312":"This article provides an overview of the recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer-related lymphedema. Lymphedema incidence by tumor site is evaluated. Measurement techniques and trends in patient education and treatment are also summarized to include current trends in therapeutic and surgical treatment options as well as longer-term management. Finally, an overview of the policies related to insurance coverage and reimbursement will give the clinician an overview of important trends in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cancer-related lymphedema.","313":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of antibody-producing plasma cells. The pathognomonic laboratory finding is a monoclonal immunoglobulin or free light chain in the serum and\/or urine in association with bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells. MM develops from a premalignant condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), often via an intermediate stage termed smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), which differs from active myeloma by the absence of disease-related end-organ damage. Unlike MGUS and SMM, active MM requires therapy. Over the past 6 decades, major advancements in the care of MM patients have occurred, in particular, the introduction of novel agents (ie, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents) and the implementation of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in suitable candidates. The effectiveness and good tolerability of novel agents allowed for their combined use in induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy, resulting in deeper and more sustained clinical response and extended progression-free and overall survival. Previously a rapidly lethal cancer with few therapeutic options, MM is the hematologic cancer with the most novel US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in the past 15 years. These advances have resulted in more frequent long-term remissions, transforming MM into a chronic illness for many patients.","314":"","315":"","316":"Radiation therapy remains a standard treatment option for men with localized prostate cancer. Alone or in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy, it represents a curative treatment and has been shown to prolong survival in selected populations. In this article, the authors review recent advances in prostate radiation-treatment techniques, photon versus proton radiation, modification of treatment fractionation, and brachytherapy-all focusing on disease control and the impact on morbidity. Also discussed are refinements in the risk stratification of men with prostate cancer and how these are better for matching patients to appropriate treatment, particularly around combined androgen-deprivation therapy. Many of these advances have cost and treatment burden implications, which have significant repercussions given the prevalence of prostate cancer. The discussion includes approaches to improve value and future directions for research.","317":"In 2013, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that cancer care in the United States is in crisis. Patients and their families are not receiving the information that they need to make informed decisions about their cancer care. Many patients do not have access to palliative care and too few are referred to hospice at the appropriate point in their disease trajectory. Simultaneously, there is a growing demand for cancer care with increases in new cancer diagnoses and the number of patients surviving cancer. Furthermore, there is a workforce shortage to care for this growing and elderly population. The IOM's report, Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis, outlined recommendations to improve the quality of cancer care. This article provides an overview of the IOM report and highlights the recommendations that are most relevant to practicing clinicians who care for patients with cancer across the continuum. The implementation of the recommendations in clinical practice will require better patient-clinician communication, improved care coordination, targeted clinician training, effective dissemination of evidence-based guidelines and strategies for eliminating waste, and continuous quality assessment and improvement efforts.","318":"Engaging individuals with cancer in decision making about their treatments has received increased attention; shared decision making (SDM) has become a hallmark of patient-centered care. Although physicians indicate substantial interest in SDM, implementing SDM in cancer care is often complex; high levels of uncertainty may exist, and health care providers must help patients understand the potential risks versus benefits of different treatment options. However, patients who are more engaged in their health care decision making are more likely to experience confidence in and satisfaction with treatment decisions and increased trust in their providers. To implement SDM in oncology practice, physicians and other health care providers need to understand the components of SDM and the approaches to supporting and facilitating this process as part of cancer care. This review summarizes recent information regarding patient and physician factors that influence SDM for cancer care, outcomes resulting from successful SDM, and strategies for implementing SDM in oncology practice. We present a conceptual model illustrating the components of SDM in cancer care and provide recommendations for facilitating SDM in oncology practice.","319":"The interplay between abnormalities in genes coding for proteins and noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) has been among the most exciting yet unexpected discoveries in oncology over the last decade. The complexity of this network has redefined cancer research as miRNAs, produced from what was once considered \"genomic trash,\" have shown to be crucial for cancer initiation, progression, and dissemination. Naturally occurring miRNAs are very short transcripts that never produce a protein or amino acid chain, but act by regulating protein expression during cellular processes such as growth, development, and differentiation at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and\/or translational level. In this review article, miRNAs are presented as ubiquitous players involved in all cancer hallmarks. The authors also describe the most used methods to detect their expression, which have revealed the identity of hundreds of miRNAs dysregulated in cancer cells or tumor microenvironment cells. Furthermore, the role of miRNAs as hormones and as reliable cancer biomarkers and predictors of treatment response is discussed. Along with this, the authors explore current strategies in designing miRNA-targeting therapeutics, as well as the associated challenges that research envisions to overcome. Finally, a new wave in molecular oncology translational research is introduced: the study of long noncoding RNAs.","320":"","321":"When delivered with palliative intent, radiotherapy can help to alleviate a multitude of symptoms related to advanced cancer. In general, time to symptom relief is measured in weeks to months after the completion of radiotherapy. Over the past several years, an increasing number of studies have explored rates of radiotherapy use in the final months of life and have found variable rates of radiotherapy use. The optimal rate is unclear, but would incorporate anticipated efficacy in patients whose survival allows it and minimize overuse among patients with expected short survival. Clinician prediction has been shown to overestimate the length of survival in repeated studies. Prognostic indices can provide assistance with estimations of survival length and may help to guide treatment decisions regarding palliative radiotherapy in patients with potentially short survival times. This review explores the recent studies of radiotherapy near the end of life, examines general prognostic models for patients with advanced cancer, describes specific clinical circumstances when radiotherapy may and may not be beneficial, and addresses open questions for future research to help clarify when palliative radiotherapy may be effective near the end of life.","322":"","323":"","324":"After a comprehensive review of the evidence, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recently endorsed screening with low-dose computed tomography as an early detection approach that has the potential to significantly reduce deaths due to lung cancer. Prudent implementation of lung cancer screening as a high-quality preventive health service is a complex challenge. The clinical evaluation and management of high-risk cohorts in the absence of symptoms mandates an approach that differs significantly from that of symptom-detected lung cancer. As with other cancer screenings, it is essential to provide to informed at-risk individuals a safe, high-quality, cost-effective, and accessible service. In this review, the components of a successful screening program are discussed as we begin to disseminate lung cancer screening as a national resource to improve outcomes with this lethal cancer. This information about lung cancer screening will assist clinicians with communications about the potential benefits and harms of this service for high-risk individuals considering participation in the screening process.","325":"","326":"Prostate cancer survivors approach 2.8 million in number and represent 1 in 5 of all cancer survivors in the United States. While guidelines exist for timely treatment and surveillance for recurrent disease, there is limited availability of guidelines that facilitate the provision of posttreatment clinical follow-up care to address the myriad of long-term and late effects that survivors may face. Based on recommendations set forth by a National Cancer Survivorship Resource Center expert panel, the American Cancer Society developed clinical follow-up care guidelines to facilitate the provision of posttreatment care by primary care clinicians. These guidelines were developed using a combined approach of evidence synthesis and expert consensus. Existing guidelines for health promotion, surveillance, and screening for second primary cancers were referenced when available. To promote comprehensive follow-up care and optimal health and quality of life for the posttreatment survivor, the guidelines address health promotion, surveillance for prostate cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, long-term and late effects assessment and management, psychosocial issues, and care coordination among the oncology team, primary care clinicians, and nononcology specialists. A key challenge to the development of these guidelines was the limited availability of published evidence for management of prostate cancer survivors after treatment. Much of the evidence relies on studies with small sample sizes and retrospective analyses of facility-specific and population databases.","327":"The number of cancer survivors continues to increase due to the aging and growth of the population and improvements in early detection and treatment. In order for the public health community to better serve these survivors, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborated to estimate the number of current and future cancer survivors using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program registries. In addition, current treatment patterns for the most common cancer types are described based on information in the National Cancer Data Base and the SEER and SEER-Medicare linked databases; treatment-related side effects are also briefly described. Nearly 14.5 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2014; by January 1, 2024, that number will increase to nearly 19 million. The 3 most common prevalent cancers among males are prostate cancer (43%), colorectal cancer (9%), and melanoma (8%), and those among females are cancers of the breast (41%), uterine corpus (8%), and colon and rectum (8%). The age distribution of survivors varies substantially by cancer type. For example, the majority of prostate cancer survivors (62%) are aged 70 years or older, whereas less than one-third (32%) of melanoma survivors are in this older age group. It is important for clinicians to understand the unique medical and psychosocial needs of cancer survivors and to proactively assess and manage these issues. There are a growing number of resources that can assist patients, caregivers, and health care providers in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship.","328":"","329":"","330":"This review summarizes current understanding of economic factors during the obesity epidemic and dispels some widely held, but incorrect, beliefs. Rising obesity rates coincided with increases in leisure time (rather than increased work hours), increased fruit and vegetable availability (rather than a decline in healthier foods), and increased exercise uptake. As a share of disposable income, Americans now have the cheapest food available in history, which fueled the obesity epidemic. Weight gain was surprisingly similar across sociodemographic groups or geographic areas, rather than specific to some groups (at every point in time; however, there are clear disparities). It suggests that if one wants to understand the role of the environment in the obesity epidemic, one needs to understand changes over time affecting all groups, not differences between subgroups at a given time. Although economic and technological changes in the environment drove the obesity epidemic, the evidence for effective economic policies to prevent obesity remains limited. Taxes on foods with low nutritional value could nudge behavior toward healthier diets, as could subsidies\/discounts for healthier foods. However, even a large price change for healthy foods could close only part of the gap between dietary guidelines and actual food consumption. Political support has been lacking for even moderate price interventions in the United States and this may continue until the role of environmental factors is accepted more widely. As opinion leaders, clinicians play an important role in shaping the understanding of the causes of obesity.","331":"Approximately 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States are caused by tobacco use and smoking. Cancers of eighteen sites have been causally linked to smoking, the most common of which are the lung, head and neck, bladder, and esophagus. While quit rates and quit attempt rates are relatively high shortly after a cancer diagnosis, the recidivism rates are also high. Therefore, screening, treating, and preventing relapse to tobacco use is imperative among patients with and survivors of cancer. To date, research has consistently shown that a combination of pharmacologic and behavioral interventions is needed to achieve the highest smoking cessation rates, with a recent emphasis on individualized treatment as a most promising approach. Challenges in health care systems, including the lack of appropriate resources and provider training, have slowed the progress in addition to important clinical considerations relevant to the treatment of tobacco dependence (eg, a high degree of comorbidity with psychiatric disorders and other substance use disorders). However, continued tobacco use has been shown to limit the effectiveness of major cancer treatments and to increase the risk of complications and of developing secondary cancers. The authors recommend that oncology providers screen all patients for tobacco use and refer users to specialized treatment when available. Alternatively, oncology clinicians can provide basic advice on tobacco use cessation and pharmacotherapy and\/or referral to outside resources (eg, quitlines). Herein, the authors summarize the current knowledge on tobacco use and its treatment, with a focus on the related available evidence for patients with and survivors of cancer.","332":"","333":"Increasing knowledge of the biology of melanoma has led to significant advances in drug development to fight this disease. Surgery is the primary treatment for localized disease and is an integral part of management in patients with more advanced disease. The last decade has become the era of targeted therapy in melanoma and has revolutionized the treatment of this disease. Since 2011, 4 new agents have been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma: ipilimumab, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib. Several new agents are currently in phase 3 trials with hopes of even more agents being approved for this once \"untreatable\" disease. How to integrate surgical options with more effective systemic therapies has become a new challenge for physicians. This review will provide an update on current surgical options, highlight the pathway to the development of the newly approved agents, and further discuss new treatments that are on the horizon.","334":"Despite recent calls to intensify the search for new risk factors for breast cancer, acting on information that we already have could prevent thousands of cases each year. This article reviews breast cancer primary prevention strategies that are applicable to all women, discusses the underutilization of chemoprevention in high-risk women, highlights the additional advances that could be made by including young women in prevention efforts, and comments on how the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer affects prevention research and strategies.","335":"","336":"","337":"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. This article provides an overview of colorectal cancer statistics, including the most current data on incidence, survival, and mortality rates and trends. Incidence data were provided by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2014, an estimated 71,830 men and 65,000 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 26,270 men and 24,040 women will die of the disease. Greater than one-third of all deaths (29% in men and 43% in women) will occur in individuals aged 80 years and older. There is substantial variation in tumor location by age. For example, 26% of colorectal cancers in women aged younger than 50 years occur in the proximal colon, compared with 56% of cases in women aged 80 years and older. Incidence and death rates are highest in blacks and lowest in Asians\/Pacific Islanders; among males during 2006 through 2010, death rates in blacks (29.4 per 100,000 population) were more than double those in Asians\/Pacific Islanders (13.1) and 50% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (19.2). Overall, incidence rates decreased by approximately 3% per year during the past decade (2001-2010). Notably, the largest drops occurred in adults aged 65 and older. For instance, rates for tumors located in the distal colon decreased by more than 5% per year. In contrast, rates increased during this time period among adults younger than 50 years. Colorectal cancer death rates declined by approximately 2% per year during the 1990s and by approximately 3% per year during the past decade. Progress in reducing colorectal cancer death rates can be accelerated by improving access to and use of screening and standard treatment in all populations.","338":"","339":"","340":"Breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis and treatment have led to dramatic improvements in survival and the need to focus on survivorship issues. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be gonadotoxic, resulting in impaired fertility. Techniques to help cancer survivors reproduce have been improving over the past decade. Discussion of the changes to a patient's reproductive health after cancer treatment is essential to providing comprehensive quality care. The purpose of this review is to aid in pre- and posttreatment counseling, focusing on fertility preservation and other strategies that may mitigate risks to the patient's reproductive, sexual, and overall health.","341":"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, and there is only a limited explanation of why. Risk is highest in the most industrialized countries but also is rising rapidly in the developing world. Known risk factors account for only a portion of the incidence in the high-risk populations, and there has been considerable speculation and many false leads on other possibly major determinants of risk, such as dietary fat. A hallmark of industrialization is the increasing use of electricity to light the night, both within the home and without. It has only recently become clear that this evolutionarily new and, thereby, unnatural exposure can disrupt human circadian rhythmicity, of which three salient features are melatonin production, sleep, and the circadian clock. A convergence of research in cells, rodents, and humans suggests that the health consequences of circadian disruption may be substantial. An innovative experimental model has shown that light at night markedly increases the growth of human breast cancer xenografts in rats. In humans, the theory that light exposure at night increases breast cancer risk leads to specific predictions that are being tested epidemiologically: evidence has accumulated on risk in shift workers, risk in blind women, and the impact of sleep duration on risk. If electric light at night does explain a portion of the breast cancer burden, then there are practical interventions that can be implemented, including more selective use of light and the adoption of recent advances in lighting technology and application.","342":"With a 3-fold increase in the number of cancer survivors noted since the 1970s, there are now over 28 million cancer survivors worldwide. Accordingly, there is a heightened awareness of long-term toxicities and the impact on quality of life following treatment in cancer survivors. This review will address the increasing importance and challenge of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, with a focus on neuropathy associated with the treatment of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, testicular cancer, and hematological cancers. An overview of the diagnosis, symptomatology, and pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy will be provided, with a critical analysis of assessment strategies, neuroprotective approaches, and potential treatments. The review will concentrate on neuropathy associated with taxanes, platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, thalidomide, and bortezomib, providing clinical information specific to these chemotherapies.","343":"Cancer metastasis may be regarded as a progressive process from its inception in the primary tumor microenvironment to distant sites by way of the lymphovascular system. Although this type of tumor dissemination often occurs in an orderly fashion via the sentinel lymph node (SLN), acting as a possible gateway to the regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, and peripheral blood and ultimately to distant metastatic sites, this is not a general rule as tumor cells may enter the blood and spread to distant sites, bypassing the SLN. Methods of detecting micrometastatic cancer cells in the SLN, bone marrow, and peripheral blood of patients have been established. Patients with cancer cells in their SLN, bone marrow, or peripheral blood have worse clinical outcomes than patients with no evidence of spread to these compartments. The presence of these cells also has important biologic implications for disease progression and the clinician's understanding of the process of cancer metastasis. Further characterization of these micrometastatic cancer cells at each stage and site of metastasis is needed to design novel selective therapies for a more \"personalized\" treatment.","344":"In this article, the American Cancer Society provides estimates of the number of new cancer cases and deaths for children and adolescents in the United States and summarizes the most recent and comprehensive data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (which are reported in detail for the first time here and include high-quality data from 45 states and the District of Columbia, covering 90% of the US population). In 2014, an estimated 15,780 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed and 1960 deaths from cancer will occur among children and adolescents aged birth to 19 years. The annual incidence rate of cancer in children and adolescents is 186.6 per 1 million children aged birth to 19 years. Approximately 1 in 285 children will be diagnosed with cancer before age 20 years, and approximately 1 in 530 young adults between the ages of 20 and 39 years is a childhood cancer survivor. It is therefore likely that most pediatric and primary care practices will be involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of young patients and survivors. In addition to cancer statistics, this article will provide an overview of risk factors, symptoms, treatment, and long-term and late effects for common pediatric cancers.","345":"","346":"","347":"","348":"","349":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Each year the American Cancer Society publishes a summary of its guidelines for early cancer detection, a report on data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening. In this issue of the journal, we summarize current American Cancer Society cancer screening guidelines. In addition, the latest data on the use of cancer screening from the National Health Interview Survey is described, as are several issues related to screening coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including the expansion of the Medicaid program.","350":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data were collected by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2014. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2006-2010), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.4% per year in women. The combined cancer death rate (deaths per 100,000 population) has been continuously declining for 2 decades, from a peak of 215.1 in 1991 to 171.8 in 2010. This 20% decline translates to the avoidance of approximately 1,340,400 cancer deaths (952,700 among men and 387,700 among women) during this time period. The magnitude of the decline in cancer death rates from 1991 to 2010 varies substantially by age, race, and sex, ranging from no decline among white women aged 80 years and older to a 55% decline among black men aged 40 years to 49 years. Notably, black men experienced the largest drop within every 10-year age group. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.","351":"Radiation therapy is a critical component of the multidisciplinary management of invasive breast cancer. In appropriately selected patients, radiation not only improves local control, sparing patients the morbidity and distress of local recurrence, but it also improves survival by preventing seeding and reseeding of distant metastases from persistent reservoirs of locoregional disease. In recent years, considerable progress has been made toward improving our ability to select patients most likely to benefit from radiotherapy and to administer treatment in ways that maximize clinical benefit while minimizing toxicity and burden. This article reviews the role of radiation therapy in invasive breast cancer management, both after breast-conserving surgery and after mastectomy. It focuses particularly on emerging evidence that helps to define the clinical situations in which radiotherapy is indicated, the appropriate targets of treatment, and optimal approaches for minimizing both the toxicity and the burden of treatment, all in the context of the evolving surgical and systemic management of this common disease. It includes a discussion of new approaches in breast cancer radiotherapy, including hypofractionation and intensity modulation, as well as a discussion of promising avenues for future research.","352":"Silica has been known to cause silicosis for centuries, and evidence that silica causes lung cancer has accumulated over the last several decades. This article highlights 3 important developments in understanding the health effects of silica and preventing illness and death from silica exposure at work. First, recent epidemiologic studies have provided new information about silica and lung cancer. This includes detailed exposure-response data, thereby enabling the quantitative risk assessment needed for regulation. New studies have also shown that excess lung mortality occurs in silica-exposed workers who do not have silicosis and who do not smoke. Second, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has recently proposed a new rule lowering the permissible occupational limit for silica. There are approximately 2 million US workers currently exposed to silica. Risk assessments estimate that lowering occupational exposure limits from the current to the proposed standard will reduce silicosis and lung cancer mortality to approximately one-half of the rates predicted under the current standard. Third, low-dose computed tomography scanning has now been proven to be an effective screening method for lung cancer. For clinicians, asking about occupational history to determine if silica exposure has occurred is recommended. If such exposure has occurred, extra attention might be given to the early detection of silicosis and lung cancer, as well as extra emphasis on quitting smoking.","353":"Translational and clinical cancer research, as well as clinical trials and treatment of cancer, are essentially structured based on the organ in which tumors originate. However, the recent explosion of knowledge about the molecular characteristics of tumors is opening a new way to tackle cancer. This article proposes a different approach to the classification of cancer with important implications for treatment and for basic, translational, and clinical research. The authors postulate that cancers from diverse organs of origin with similar molecular traits should be managed together. The common molecular features observed in different tumors determine clinical actions in a better way than organ-based classification. Thus, comparisons between tumors residing in different locations but with shared molecular characteristics will improve the therapeutic approach and the understanding of the biology of cancer.","354":"","355":"","356":"","357":"In this article, the American Cancer Society provides an overview of female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Approximately 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,620 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2013. One in 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. Breast cancer incidence rates increased slightly among African American women; decreased among Hispanic women; and were stable among whites, Asian Americans\/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians\/Alaska Natives from 2006 to 2010. Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older; however, incidence rates are converging among white and African American women, particularly among women aged 50 years to 59 years. Incidence rates increased for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in the youngest white women, Hispanic women aged 60 years to 69 years, and all but the oldest African American women. In contrast, estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers declined among most age and racial\/ethnic groups. These divergent trends may reflect etiologic heterogeneity and the differing effects of some factors, such as obesity and parity, on risk by tumor subtype. Since 1990, breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34% and this decrease was evident in all racial\/ethnic groups except American Indians\/Alaska Natives. Nevertheless, survival disparities persist by race\/ethnicity, with African American women having the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial\/ethnic group. Continued progress in the control of breast cancer will require sustained and increased efforts to provide high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment to all segments of the population.","358":"In recent years, there has been an unprecedented expansion in the field of nanomedicine with the development of new nanoparticles for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Nanoparticles have unique biological properties given their small size and large surface area-to-volume ratio, which allows them to bind, absorb, and carry compounds such as small molecule drugs, DNA, RNA, proteins, and probes with high efficiency. Their tunable size, shape, and surface characteristics also enable them to have high stability, high carrier capacity, the ability to incorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances and compatibility with different administration routes, thereby making them highly attractive in many aspects of oncology. This review article will discuss how nanoparticles are able to function as carriers for chemotherapeutic drugs to increase their therapeutic index; how they can function as therapeutic agents in photodynamic, gene, and thermal therapy; and how nanoparticles can be used as molecular imaging agents to detect and monitor cancer progression.","359":"Scientific advances in novel cancer therapeutics have led to remarkable changes in oncology practice and longer lives for patients diagnosed with incurable malignancies. However, the myriad options for treatment have established a culture of cancer care that has not been matched with a similar availability of efficacious supportive care interventions aimed at relieving debilitating symptoms due to progressive disease and treatment side effects. Accumulating data show that the introduction of palliative care services at the time of diagnosis of advanced cancer leads to meaningful improvement in the experiences of patients and family caregivers by emphasizing symptom management, quality of life, and treatment planning. In this review article, the rationale and evidence base for this model of early palliative care services integrated into standard oncology care are presented. In addition, the implications and limitations of the existing data to 1) elucidate the mechanisms by which early palliative care benefits patients and families; 2) guide the dissemination and application of this model in outpatient settings; and 3) inform health care policy regarding the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective, and comprehensive cancer care are discussed.","360":"Pancreatic cancer is currently one of the deadliest of the solid malignancies. However, surgery to resect neoplasms of the pancreas is safer and less invasive than ever, novel drug combinations have been shown to improve survival, advances in radiation therapy have resulted in less toxicity, and enormous strides have been made in the understanding of the fundamental genetics of pancreatic cancer. These advances provide hope but they also increase the complexity of caring for patients. It is clear that multidisciplinary care that provides comprehensive and coordinated evaluation and treatment is the most effective way to manage patients with pancreatic cancer.","361":"Adult cancer survivors suffer an extremely diverse and complex set of impairments, affecting virtually every organ system. Both physical and psychological impairments may contribute to a decreased health-related quality of life and should be identified throughout the care continuum. Recent evidence suggests that more cancer survivors have a reduced health-related quality of life as a result of physical impairments than due to psychological ones. Research has also demonstrated that the majority of cancer survivors will have significant impairments and that these often go undetected and\/or untreated, and consequently may result in disability. Furthermore, physical disability is a leading cause of distress in this population. The scientific literature has shown that rehabilitation improves pain, function, and quality of life in cancer survivors. In fact, rehabilitation efforts can ameliorate physical (including cognitive) impairments at every stage along the course of treatment. This includes prehabilitation before cancer treatment commences and multimodal interdisciplinary rehabilitation during and after acute cancer treatment. Rehabilitation appears to be cost-effective and may reduce both direct and indirect health care costs, thereby reducing the enormous financial burden of cancer. Therefore, it is critical that survivors are screened for both psychological and physical impairments and then referred appropriately to trained rehabilitation health care professionals. This review suggests an impairment-driven cancer rehabilitation model that includes screening and treating impairments all along the care continuum in order to minimize disability and maximize quality of life.","362":"","363":"","364":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is characterized by 6 striking features: increasing incidence, male predominance, lack of preventive measures, opportunities for early detection, demanding surgical therapy and care, and poor prognosis. Reasons for its rapidly increasing incidence include the rising prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and obesity, combined with the decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. The strong male predominance remains unexplained, but hormonal influence might play an important role. Future prevention might include the treatment of reflux or obesity or chemoprevention with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or statins, but no evidence-based preventive measures are currently available. Likely future developments include endoscopic screening of better defined high-risk groups for EAC. Individuals with Barrett esophagus might benefit from surveillance, at least those with dysplasia, but screening and surveillance strategies need careful evaluation to be feasible and cost-effective. The surgery for EAC is more extensive than virtually any other standard procedure, and postoperative survival, health-related quality of life, and nutrition need to be improved (eg, by improved treatment, better decision-making, and more individually tailored follow-up). Promising clinical developments include increased survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the potentially reduced impact on health-related quality of life after minimally invasive surgery, and the new endoscopic therapies for dysplastic Barrett esophagus or early EAC. The overall survival rates are improving slightly, but poor prognosis remains a challenge.","365":"Community health centers are uniquely positioned to address disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening as they have addressed other disparities. In 2012, the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, which is the funding agency for the health center program, added a requirement that health centers report CRC screening rates as a standard performance measure. These annually reported, publically available data are a major strategic opportunity to improve screening rates for CRC. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted provisions to expand the capacity of the federal health center program. The recent report of the Institute of Medicine on integrating public health and primary care included an entire section devoted to CRC screening as a target for joint work. These developments make this the ideal time to integrate lifesaving CRC screening into the preventive care already offered by health centers. This article offers 5 strategies that address the challenges health centers face in increasing CRC screening rates. The first 2 strategies focus on improving the processes of primary care. The third emphasizes working productively with other medical providers and institutions. The fourth strategy is about aligning leadership. The final strategy is focused on using tools that have been derived from models that work.","366":"Thyroid cancer exists in several forms. Differentiated thyroid cancers include those with papillary and follicular histologies. These tumors exist along a spectrum of differentiation, and their incidence continues to climb. A number of advances in the diagnosis and treatment of differentiated thyroid cancers now exist. These include molecular diagnostics and more advanced strategies for risk stratification. Medullary cancer arises from the parafollicular cells and not the follicular cells. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment differs from those of differentiated thyroid tumors. Genetic testing and newer adjuvant therapies have changed the diagnosis and treatment of medullary thyroid cancer. This review will focus on the epidemiology, diagnosis, workup, and treatment of both differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers, focusing specifically on newer developments in the field.","367":"","368":"","369":"","370":"","371":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Advances in genomics and molecular biology have identified aberrant proteins in cancer cells that are attractive targets for cancer therapy. Because these proteins are overexpressed or dysregulated in cancer cells compared with normal cells, it was assumed that their inhibitors will be narrowly targeted and relatively nontoxic. However, this hope has not been achieved. Current targeted agents exhibit the same frequency and severity of toxicities as traditional cytotoxic agents, with the main difference being the nature of the toxic effects. Thus, the classical chemotherapy toxicities of alopecia, myelosuppression, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting have been generally replaced by vascular, dermatologic, endocrine, coagulation, immunologic, ocular, and pulmonary toxicities. These toxicities need to be recognized, prevented, and optimally managed.","372":null,"373":"Despite the difficulty in clearly defining and measuring spirituality, a growing literature describes its importance in oncology and survivorship. Religious\/spiritual beliefs influence patients' decision-making with respect to both complementary therapies and aggressive care at the end of life. Measures of spirituality and spiritual well-being correlate with quality of life in cancer patients, cancer survivors, and caregivers. Spiritual needs, reflective of existential concerns in several domains, are a source of significant distress, and care for these needs has been correlated with better psychological and spiritual adjustment as well as with less aggressive care at the end of life. Studies show that while clinicians such as nurses and physicians regard some spiritual care as an appropriate aspect of their role, patients report that they provide it infrequently. Many clinicians report that their religious\/spiritual beliefs influence their practice, and practices such as mindfulness have been shown to enhance clinician self-care and equanimity. Challenges remain in the areas of conceptualizing and measuring spirituality, developing and implementing training for spiritual care, and coordinating and partnering with chaplains and religious communities.","374":"The National Cancer Survivorship Resource Center (The Survivorship Center) began in 2010 as a collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the George Washington University Cancer Institute and was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Survivorship Center aims to improve the overall health and quality of life of posttreatment cancer survivors. One key to addressing the needs of this ever-growing population is to develop clinical follow-up care guidelines that emphasize not only the importance of surveillance for cancer recurrence, but also address the assessment and management of the physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects that may result from having cancer and undergoing cancer treatment as well as highlight the importance of healthy behaviors that can reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, second primary cancers, and other chronic diseases. Currently, The Survivorship Center is coordinating the work of experts in oncology, primary care, and other health care professions to develop follow-up care guidelines for 10 priority cancer sites.","375":"Recent guidelines on cancer screening have provided not only more screening options but also conflicting recommendations. Thus, patients, with their clinicians' support, must decide whether to get screened, which modality to use, and how often to undergo screening. Decision aids could potentially lead to better shared decision-making regarding screening between the patient and the clinician. A total of 73 decision aids concerning screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers were reviewed. The goal of this review was to assess the effectiveness of such decision aids, examine areas in need of more research, and determine how the decision aids can be currently applied in the real-world setting. Most studies used sound study designs. Significant variation existed in the setting, theoretical framework, and measured outcomes. Just over one-third of the decision aids included an explicit values clarification. Other than knowledge, little consistency was noted with regard to which patient attributes were measured as outcomes. Few studies actually measured shared decision-making. Little information was available regarding the feasibility and outcomes of integrating decision aids into practice. In this review, the implications for future research, as well as what clinicians can do now to incorporate decision aids into their practice, are discussed.","376":"","377":"","378":"In this article, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths for African Americans and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, survival, and screening prevalence based upon incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. It is estimated that 176,620 new cases of cancer and 64,880 deaths will occur among African Americans in 2013. From 2000 to 2009, the overall cancer death rate among males declined faster among African Americans than whites (2.4% vs 1.7% per year), but among females, the rate of decline was similar (1.5% vs 1.4% per year, respectively). The decrease in cancer death rates among African American males was the largest of any racial or ethnic group. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of nearly 200,000 deaths from cancer among African Americans. Five-year relative survival is lower for African Americans than whites for most cancers at each stage of diagnosis. The extent to which these disparities reflect unequal access to health care versus other factors remains an active area of research. Overall, progress in reducing cancer death rates has been made, although more can and should be done to accelerate this progress through ensuring equitable access to cancer prevention, early detection, and state-of-the-art treatments.","379":"Each year the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, a report on data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening.

The purpose of this article is to review existing literature on the risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment of hot flashes in individuals with cancer. Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant English-language literature published through June 15, 2012. Results indicated that risk factors for hot flashes in cancer include patient-related factors (eg, age, race\/ethnicity, educational level, smoking history, cardiovascular risk including body mass index, and genetics) and disease-related factors (eg, cancer diagnosis and dose\/type of treatment). In addition, although the pathophysiology of hot flashes has remained elusive, these symptoms are likely attributable to disruptions in thermoregulation and neurochemicals. Therapies that have been offered or tested fall into 4 broad categories: pharmacological, nutraceutical, surgical, and complementary\/behavioral strategies. The evidence base for this broad range of therapies varies, with some treatments not yet having been fully tested or showing equivocal results. The evidence base surrounding all therapies is evaluated to enhance hot flash treatment decision-making by clinicians and patients.","381":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.5% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4%), cancers of the stomach (3.1%) and colorectum (3.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations.","382":"A growing number of well-designed epidemiological and molecular studies provide substantial evidence that the pesticides used in agricultural, commercial, and home and garden applications are associated with excess cancer risk. This risk is associated both with those applying the pesticide and, under some conditions, those who are simply bystanders to the application. In this article, the epidemiological, molecular biology, and toxicological evidence emerging from recent literature assessing the link between specific pesticides and several cancers including prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer are integrated. Although the review is not exhaustive in its scope or depth, the literature does strongly suggest that the public health problem is real. If we are to avoid the introduction of harmful chemicals into the environment in the future, the integrated efforts of molecular biology, pesticide toxicology, and epidemiology are needed to help identify the human carcinogens and thereby improve our understanding of human carcinogenicity and reduce cancer risk.","383":"","384":"","385":"","386":"Findings from the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial established that lung cancer mortality in specific high-risk groups can be reduced by annual screening with low-dose computed tomography. These findings indicate that the adoption of lung cancer screening could save many lives. Based on the results of the National Lung Screening Trial, the American Cancer Society is issuing an initial guideline for lung cancer screening. This guideline recommends that clinicians with access to high-volume, high-quality lung cancer screening and treatment centers should initiate a discussion about screening with apparently healthy patients aged 55 years to 74 years who have at least a 30-pack-year smoking history and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. A process of informed and shared decision-making with a clinician related to the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography should occur before any decision is made to initiate lung cancer screening. Smoking cessation counseling remains a high priority for clinical attention in discussions with current smokers, who should be informed of their continuing risk of lung cancer. Screening should not be viewed as an alternative to smoking cessation.","387":"Human papillomavirus (HPV), one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide, has an established role in the pathogenesis of genital malignancies such as cervical cancer. The virus has also been implicated in the oncogenesis of nongenital cancers including head and neck malignancies (specifically oropharyngeal cancers) as well as anal cancer. There is less clarity regarding its role in lung and esophageal cancers. Worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing over time. These patients have improved outcomes compared with those with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, and there is continued interest in designing treatments specifically for this HPV-positive subgroup. Clinicians continue to gain an understanding of HPV in anal cancers and the risk factors associated with infection and progression to malignancy. This has potential implications for the eventual screening of high-risk groups. While HPV vaccination is currently approved for the prevention of cervical cancer, it also has potential in the prevention of all HPV-associated malignancies. In this review, current understanding of the role of HPV in nongenital cancers is discussed, as well as future implications for treatment and prevention.","388":"","389":"","390":"","391":"","392":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Hypnosis has been used to provide psychological and physical comfort to individuals diagnosed with cancer for nearly 200 years.

Overall, the literature supports the benefits of hypnosis for improving quality of life during the course of cancer and its treatment. However, a great deal more work needs to be done to explore the use of hypnosis in survivorship, to understand the mediators and moderators of hypnosis interventions, and to develop effective dissemination strategies.","393":"The use of robotic assistance facilitates minimally invasive surgery and has been widely adopted across multiple specialties. This article reviews the published literature on use of this technology for treatment of oncologic conditions. PubMed searches were performed for articles published between 2000 and 2012 using the keywords \"robotic\" or \"robotic surgery\" in conjunction with \"oncology\" or \"cancer.\" Although the most common use for robotics was to treat urologic oncologic conditions, it has also been widely adopted for gynecologic, general, thoracic, and head and neck surgeries. For several procedures, there is evidence that robotics offers short-term benefits such as shorter lengths of stay and lower intraoperative blood loss, with safety profiles and oncologic outcomes comparable to open or conventional laparoscopic approaches. However, long-term oncologic outcomes are generally lacking, and robotic surgeries are more costly than open or laparoscopic surgeries. Robotic technology is widely used in oncologic surgery with demonstrated short-term advantages. However, whether the benefits of robotics justify the higher costs warrant large comparative effectiveness studies with long-term outcomes.","394":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers in which a continued increase in incidence has been observed over several years. As such, there has been a focus on safe and accurate diagnosis and the development of treatment algorithms that take into consideration the unique complexities of this patient population. In the past decade, there have been improvements in nonsurgical treatment platforms and better standardization with respect to the diagnosis and patient eligibility for liver transplant. How to navigate patients through the challenges of treatment is difficult and depends on several factors: 1) patient-related variables such as comorbid conditions that influence treatment eligibility; 2) liver-related variables such as Child-Pugh score; and 3) tumor-related variables such as size, number, pattern of spread within the liver, and vascular involvement. The objectives of this review are to put into perspective the current treatment options for patients with HCC, the unique advantages and disadvantages of each treatment approach, and the evidence that supports the introduction of sorafenib into the multidisciplinary management of HCC.","395":"Imaging has become a pivotal component throughout a patient's encounter with cancer, from initial disease detection and characterization through treatment response assessment and posttreatment follow-up.

Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic adults are less likely to be current smokers (13% vs 22%) or frequent alcohol drinkers, but they are more likely to be obese (32% vs 26%) and to have lower levels of mammography use within the past year (46% vs 51%), colorectal screening as per recommended intervals (47% vs 61%), and Papanicolaou (Pap) test use within the past 3 years (74% vs 79%). Within the Hispanic population, the prevalence of these risk factors and early detection methods substantially vary by country of origin. For example, Cuban men (20.7%) and Puerto Rican men (19%) had the highest levels of current smoking than any other Hispanic subgroups, while Mexican women had the lowest levels of mammogram use (44%) and Pap test use (71%). Hispanic migrants have a higher prevalence of hepatitis B virus and Helicobacter pylori, which cause liver and stomach cancer, respectively. Among Hispanic adolescents, tobacco use (eg, 20.8% use of any tobacco products), alcohol use (42.9%), and obesity (23.2%) remain highly prevalent risk factors. Although 56% of Hispanic adolescents initiate human papillomavirus vaccination, only 56% of them completed the 3-dose series. Differences in risk factors and early detection testing among Hispanic groups should be considered in clinical settings and for cancer control planning.","399":"Hispanics\/Latinos are the largest and fastest growing major demographic group in the United States, accounting for 16.3% (50.5 million\/310 million) of the US population in 2010. In this article, the American Cancer Society updates a previous report on cancer statistics for Hispanics using incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2012, an estimated 112,800 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed and 33,200 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics. In 2009, the most recent year for which actual data are available, cancer surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death among Hispanics. Among US Hispanics during the past 10 years of available data (2000-2009), cancer incidence rates declined by 1.7% per year among men and 0.3% per year among women, while cancer death rates declined by 2.3% per year in men and 1.4% per year in women. Hispanics have lower incidence and death rates than non-Hispanic whites for all cancers combined and for the 4 most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and bronchus, and colorectum). However, Hispanics have higher incidence and mortality rates for cancers of the stomach, liver, uterine cervix, and gallbladder, reflecting greater exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents, lower rates of screening for cervical cancer, differences in lifestyle and dietary patterns, and possibly genetic factors. Strategies for reducing cancer risk among Hispanics include increasing utilization of screening and available vaccines, as well as implementing effective interventions to reduce obesity, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use.","400":"Answer questions and earn CME\/CNE Oral complications resulting from cancer and cancer therapies cause acute and late toxicities that may be underreported, underrecognized, and undertreated. Recent advances in cancer treatment have led to changes in the incidence, nature, and severity of oral complications. As the number of survivors increases, it is becoming increasingly recognized that the aggressive management of oral toxicities is needed to ensure optimal long-term oral health and general well-being. Advances in care have had an impact on previously recognized oral complications and are leading to newly recognized adverse effects. Here, the authors briefly review advances in cancer therapy, including recent advances in surgery, oral care, radiation therapy, hematopoietic cell transplantation, and medical oncology; describe how these advances affect oral health; and discuss the frequent and\/or severe oral health complications associated with cancer and cancer treatment and their effect upon long-term health. Although some of the acute oral toxicities of cancer therapies may be reduced, they remain essentially unavoidable. The significant impact of long-term complications requires increased awareness and recognition to promote prevention and appropriate intervention. It is therefore important for the primary oncologist to be aware of these complications so that appropriate measures can be implemented in a timely manner. Prevention and management is best provided via multidisciplinary health care teams, which must be integrated and communicate effectively in order to provide the best patient care in a coordinated manner at the appropriate time.","401":"","402":"","403":"Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires assess topics a patient can report about his or her own health. This includes symptoms (eg, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, pain, or frequent urination), physical functioning (eg, difficulty climbing stairs or difficulty fastening buttons), and mental health (eg, anxiety, fear, or worry). Electronic PRO (ePRO) systems are used in oncology clinical care because of 1) their ability to enhance clinical care by flagging important symptoms and saving clinicians time; 2) the availability of standardized methods for creating and implementing PROs in clinics; and 3) the existence of user-friendly platforms for patient self-reporting like tablet computers and automated telephone surveys. Many ePRO systems can provide actionable links to clinical care such as summary reports in a patient's electronic medical record and real-time e-mail alerts to providers when patients report acute needs. This review presents 5 examples of ePRO systems currently in use in oncology practice. These systems support multiple clinical activities, including assessment of symptoms and toxicities related to chemotherapy and radiation, postoperative surveillance, and symptom management during palliative care and hospice. Patient self-reporting is possible both at clinical visits and between visits over the Internet or by telephone. The implementation of an ePRO system requires significant resources and expertise, as well as user training. ePRO systems enable regular monitoring of patient symptoms, function, and needs, and can enhance the efficiency and quality of care as well as communication with patients.","404":"Although there has been considerable progress in reducing cancer incidence in the United States, the number of cancer survivors continues to increase due to the aging and growth of the population and improvements in survival rates. As a result, it is increasingly important to understand the unique medical and psychosocial needs of survivors and be aware of resources that can assist patients, caregivers, and health care providers in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship. To highlight the challenges and opportunities to serve these survivors, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute estimated the prevalence of cancer survivors on January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2022, by cancer site. Data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries were used to describe median age and stage at diagnosis and survival; data from the National Cancer Data Base and the SEER-Medicare Database were used to describe patterns of cancer treatment. An estimated 13.7 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2012, and by January 1, 2022, that number will increase to nearly 18 million. The 3 most prevalent cancers among males are prostate (43%), colorectal (9%), and melanoma of the skin (7%), and those among females are breast (41%), uterine corpus (8%), and colorectal (8%).

This report summarizes their findings and is intended to present health care providers with the best possible information with which to help cancer survivors and their families make informed choices related to nutrition and physical activity. The report discusses nutrition and physical activity guidelines during the continuum of cancer care, briefly highlighting important issues during cancer treatment and for patients with advanced cancer, but focusing largely on the needs of the population of individuals who are disease free or who have stable disease following their recovery from treatment. It also discusses select nutrition and physical activity issues such as body weight, food choices, food safety, and dietary supplements; issues related to selected cancer sites; and common questions about diet, physical activity, and cancer survivorship.","411":"There have been more drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer in the past 3 years than in the prior 3 decades, with additional drugs on the verge of approval based on the results of recently reported randomized trials. While an improvement in the understanding of the pathogenesis of castration-resistant prostate cancer has undeniably accelerated the transition of novel approaches from \"bench to bedside,\" the recent successes in the treatment of prostate cancer are also a result of the efforts of clinical investigators to redefine the framework in which drugs for castration-resistant disease are evaluated. This review will explore the shifting paradigm in drug development for castration-resistant prostate cancer over the past several decades, and highlight how new definitions, trial designs, and endpoints have facilitated the emergence of new therapies for this challenging disease.","412":"In September 2010, the American Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute convened a conference to review current issues in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) risk communication and decision-making and to identify directions for future research. Specific topics included patient and health care provider knowledge and attitudes about DCIS and its treatment, how to explain DCIS to patients given the heterogeneity of the disease, consideration of nomenclature changes, and the usefulness of decision tools\/aids. This report describes the proceedings of the workshop in the context of the current literature and discusses future directions. Evidence suggests that there is a lack of clarity about the implications and risks of a diagnosis of DCIS among patients, providers, and researchers. Research is needed to understand better the biology and mechanisms of the progression of DCIS to invasive breast cancer and the factors that predict those subtypes of DCIS that do not progress, as well as efforts to improve the communication and informed decision-making surrounding DCIS.","413":"The management of rectal cancer has transformed over the last 3 decades and continues to evolve. Some of these changes parallel progress made with other cancers: refinement of surgical technique to improve organ preservation, selective use of neoadjuvant (and adjuvant) therapy, and emergence of criteria suggesting a role for individually tailored therapy. Other changes are driven by fairly unique issues including functional considerations, rectal anatomic features, and surgical technical issues. Further complexity is due to the variety of staging modalities (each with its own limitations), neoadjuvant treatment alternatives, and competing strategies for sequencing multimodal treatment even for nonmetastatic disease. Importantly, observations of tumor response made in the era of neoadjuvant therapy are reshaping some traditionally held concepts about tumor behavior. Frameworks for prioritizing and integrating complex data can help to formulate treatment plans for patients.","414":"An update to the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline regarding screening for the early detection of cervical precancerous lesions and cancer is presented.

The objectives of this review are to summarize epidemiologic data on cancer risks associated with diagnostic procedures, describe how exposures from recent diagnostic procedures relate to radiation levels linked with cancer occurrence, and propose a framework of strategies to reduce radiation from diagnostic imaging in patients. We briefly review radiation dose definitions, mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis, key epidemiologic studies of medical and other radiation sources and cancer risks, and dose trends from diagnostic procedures. We describe cancer risks from experimental studies, future projected risks from current imaging procedures, and the potential for higher risks in genetically susceptible populations. To reduce future projected cancers from diagnostic procedures, we advocate the widespread use of evidence-based appropriateness criteria for decisions about imaging procedures; oversight of equipment to deliver reliably the minimum radiation required to attain clinical objectives; development of electronic lifetime records of imaging procedures for patients and their physicians; and commitment by medical training programs, professional societies, and radiation protection organizations to educate all stakeholders in reducing radiation from diagnostic procedures.","419":"Despite declines in incidence rates for the most common cancers, the incidence of several cancers has increased in the past decade, including cancers of the pancreas, liver, thyroid, and kidney and melanoma of the skin, as well as esophageal adenocarcinoma and certain subsites of oropharyngeal cancer associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Population-based incidence data compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries were used to examine trends in incidence rates from 1999 through 2008 for the 7 cancers listed by sex, age group, race\/ethnicity, and stage at diagnosis. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate average annual percent changes in incidence rates (1999-2008). Rates for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, cancer of the pancreas, and melanoma of the skin increased only in whites, except for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which also increased in Hispanic men. Liver cancer rates increased in white, black, and Hispanic men and in black women only. In contrast, incidence rates for thyroid and kidney cancers increased in all racial\/ethnic groups, except American Indian\/Alaska Native men. Increases in incidence rates by age were steepest for liver and HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers among those aged 55 [corrected] to 64 years and for melanoma of the skin in those aged 65 years and older. Notably, for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer in men and thyroid cancer in women, incidence rates were higher in those aged 55 to 64 years than in those aged 65 years and older. Rates increased for both local and advanced stage diseases for most cancer sites. The reasons for these increasing trends are not entirely known. Part of the increase (for esophageal adenocarcinoma and cancers of the pancreas, liver, and kidney) may be linked to the increasing prevalence of obesity as well as increases in early detection practices for some cancers. These rising trends will exacerbate the growing cancer burden associated with population expansion and aging. Additional research is needed to determine the underlying reasons for these increasing trends.","420":"Each year the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, a report on data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening.

All National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers were surveyed concerning the extent to which SCPs for survivors of breast and colorectal cancers are in use, their concordance with the IOM's recommendation, and details about SCP delivery. Survivors and primary care providers typically lack the information the IOM suggested should be included in SCPs. Oncology providers view SCPs favorably but express concerns about the feasibility of their implementation. Fewer than one-half (43%) of NCI-designated cancer centers deliver SCPs to their breast or colorectal cancer survivors. Of those that do, none deliver SCPs that include all components recommended by the IOM. Survivors' and providers' opinions about the use of SCPs are favorable, but there are barriers to implementation. SCPs are not widely used in NCI-designated cancer centers.

The ACS Guidelines focus on recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or creates barriers to healthy behaviors. Therefore, this committee presents recommendations for community action to accompany the 4 recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. These recommendations for community action recognize that a supportive social and physical environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors.

The Patient Centered Medical Home model (PCMH) is at the center of efforts to reinvent primary care practice, and is regarded as the most promising approach to addressing the burden of chronic disease, improving health outcomes, and reducing health spending. However, the potential for the medical home to improve the delivery of cancer screening (and preventive services in general) has received limited attention in both conceptualization and practice. Medical home demonstrations to date have included few evidence-based preventive services in their outcome measures, and few have evaluated the effect of different payment models. Decreasing use of hospitals and emergency rooms and an emphasis on improving chronic care represent improvements in effective delivery of healthcare, but leave opportunities for reducing the burden of cancer untouched. Data confirm that what does or does not happen in the primary care setting has a substantial impact on cancer outcomes. Insofar as cancer is the leading cause of death before age 80, the PCMH model must prioritize adherence to cancer screening according to recommended guidelines, and systems, financial incentives, and reimbursements must be aligned to achieve that goal. This article explores capacities that are needed in the medical home model to facilitate the integration of cancer screening and other preventive services. These capacities include improved patient access and communication, health risk assessments, periodic preventive health exams, use of registries that store cancer risk information and screening history, ability to track and follow up on tests and referrals, feedback on performance, and payment models that reward cancer screening.","431":"The rapid pace of discoveries in tumor biology, imaging technology, and human genetics hold promise for an era of personalized oncology care.

Approximately 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,520 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2011. Breast cancer incidence rates were stable among all racial\/ethnic groups from 2004 to 2008. Breast cancer death rates have been declining since the early 1990s for all women except American Indians\/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. Disparities in breast cancer death rates are evident by state, socioeconomic status, and race\/ethnicity. While significant declines in mortality rates were observed for 36 states and the District of Columbia over the past 10 years, rates for 14 states remained level. Analyses by county-level poverty rates showed that the decrease in mortality rates began later and was slower among women residing in poor areas. As a result, the highest breast cancer death rates shifted from the affluent areas to the poor areas in the early 1990s. Screening rates continue to be lower in poor women compared with non-poor women, despite much progress in increasing mammography utilization. In 2008, 51.4% of poor women had undergone a screening mammogram in the past 2 years compared with 72.8% of non-poor women. Encouraging patients aged 40 years and older to have annual mammography and a clinical breast examination is the single most important step that clinicians can take to reduce suffering and death from breast cancer. Clinicians should also ensure that patients at high risk of breast cancer are identified and offered appropriate screening and follow-up.

Summaries of known hereditary cancer syndromes and highly penetrant genes are provided and contrasted with recently discovered genomic variants associated with modest increases in cancer risk. We describe the scope of knowledge, tools, and expertise required for the translation of complex genetic and genomic test information into clinical practice. The challenges of genomic counseling include the need for genetics and genomics professional education and multidisciplinary team training, the need for evidence-based information regarding the clinical utility of testing for genomic variants, the potential dangers posed by premature marketing of first-generation genomic profiles, and the need for new clinical models to improve access to and responsible communication of complex disease risk information. We conclude that given the experiences and lessons learned in the genetics era, the multidisciplinary model of genetic cancer risk assessment and management will serve as a solid foundation to support the integration of personalized genomic information into the practice of cancer medicine.","438":"Oncologic emergencies can occur at any time during the course of a malignancy, from the presenting symptom to end-stage disease. Although some of these conditions are related to cancer therapy, they are by no means confined to the period of initial diagnosis and active treatment. In the setting of recurrent malignancy, these events can occur years after the surveillance of a cancer patient has been appropriately transferred from a medical oncologist to a primary care provider. As such, awareness of a patient's cancer history and its possible complications forms an important part of any clinician's knowledge base. Prompt identification of and intervention in these emergencies can prolong survival and improve quality of life, even in the setting of terminal illness. This article reviews hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, tumor lysis syndrome, cardiac tamponade, superior vena cava syndrome, neutropenic fever, spinal cord compression, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, hyperviscosity syndrome, leukostasis, and airway obstruction in patients with malignancies. Chemotherapeutic emergencies are also addressed.","439":null,"440":"Prediction is ubiquitous across the spectrum of cancer care from screening to hospice. Indeed, oncology is often primarily a prediction problem; many of the early stage cancers cause no symptoms, and treatment is recommended because of a prediction that tumor progression would ultimately threaten a patient's quality of life or survival. Recent years have seen attempts to formalize risk prediction in cancer care. In place of qualitative and implicit prediction algorithms, such as cancer stage, researchers have developed statistical prediction tools that provide a quantitative estimate of the probability of a specific event for an individual patient. Prediction models generally have greater accuracy than reliance on stage or risk groupings, can incorporate novel predictors such as genomic data, and can be used more rationally to make treatment decisions. Several prediction models are now widely used in clinical practice, including the Gail model for breast cancer incidence or the Adjuvant! Online prediction model for breast cancer recurrence. Given the burgeoning complexity of diagnostic and prognostic information, there is simply no realistic alternative to incorporating multiple variables into a single prediction model. As such, the question should not be whether but how prediction models should be used to aid decision-making. Key issues will be integration of models into the electronic health record and more careful evaluation of models, particularly with respect to their effects on clinical outcomes.","441":"","442":"","443":null,"444":"Although patient navigation was introduced 2 decades ago, there remains a lack of consensus regarding its definition, the necessary qualifications of patient navigators, and its impact on the continuum of cancer care.

Consistent with the prior review, there is building evidence of some degree of efficacy of patient navigation in terms of increasing cancer screening rates. However, there is less recent evidence concerning the benefit of patient navigation with regard to diagnostic follow-up and in the treatment setting, and a paucity of research focusing on patient navigation in cancer survivorship remains. Methodological limitations were noted in many studies, including small sample sizes and a lack of control groups. As patient navigation programs continue to develop across North America and beyond, further research will be required to determine the efficacy of cancer patient navigation across all aspects of the cancer care continuum.","445":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved, minimally invasive therapeutic procedure that can exert a selective cytotoxic activity toward malignant cells. The procedure involves administration of a photosensitizing agent followed by irradiation at a wavelength corresponding to an absorbance band of the sensitizer. In the presence of oxygen, a series of events lead to direct tumor cell death, damage to the microvasculature, and induction of a local inflammatory reaction. Clinical studies revealed that PDT can be curative, particularly in early stage tumors. It can prolong survival in patients with inoperable cancers and significantly improve quality of life. Minimal normal tissue toxicity, negligible systemic effects, greatly reduced long-term morbidity, lack of intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms, and excellent cosmetic as well as organ function-sparing effects of this treatment make it a valuable therapeutic option for combination treatments. With a number of recent technological improvements, PDT has the potential to become integrated into the mainstream of cancer treatment.","446":"","447":"The experience of pain in cancer is widely accepted as a major threat to quality of life, and the relief of pain has emerged as a priority in oncology care. Pain is associated with both the disease as well as treatment, and management is essential from the onset of early disease through long-term survivorship or end-of-life care. Effective relief of pain is contingent upon a comprehensive assessment to identify physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects and as a foundation for multidisciplinary interventions. Fortunately, advances in pain treatment and in the field of palliative care have provided effective treatments encompassing pharmacological, cognitive-behavioral, and other approaches. The field of palliative care has emphasized that attention to symptoms such as pain is integral to quality cancer care.","448":"As people with cancer survive longer, and as the US population ages, skeletal effects of cancer treatment are becoming more pronounced. This is particularly true for breast and prostate cancer survivors because of the high average age of patients with these malignancies, the propensity of older adults in general toward the development of osteoporosis, and the wide use of therapeutic agents in these cancers that negatively impact bone health. Various therapies used in the treatment and prevention of cancer may cause decreases in bone mineral density and an increased risk of debilitating fracture, even in the absence of bone metastases. Aging is both a baseline risk factor in the development of osteoporosis and bony fracture, as well as a predictor of poor outcome after fracture. A variety of mechanisms may be responsible for the development of bone loss in patients with breast or prostate cancer. Cytotoxic chemotherapy may directly exert long-term toxic effects on bone. Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy can induce hypogonadism, leading to an increased rate of bone loss. The risk of skeletal events in older adults due to cancer therapy should be appreciated by all oncologists, geriatricians, and internists. The following review may serve as a guide to the skeletal side effects of cancer therapy in older adults with breast or prostate cancer, how to screen for treatment-related bone loss, and how to best prevent and\/or treat skeletal events.","449":"","450":"","451":"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies, largely due to the advanced stage at diagnosis in most patients. Screening strategies using ultrasound and the cancer antigen (CA) 125 tumor marker are currently under study and may lower stage at diagnosis but have not yet been shown to improve survival. Women who have inherited a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and those with the Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) have the highest risk of developing ovarian cancer but account for only approximately 10% of those with the disease. Other less common and less well-defined genetic syndromes may increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but their contribution to genetic risk is small. A clear etiology for sporadic ovarian cancer has not been identified, but risk is affected by reproductive and hormonal factors. Surgery has a unique role in ovarian cancer, as it is used not only for diagnosis and staging but also therapeutically, even in patients with widely disseminated, advanced disease. Ovarian cancer is highly sensitive to chemotherapy drugs, particularly the platinum agents, and most patients will attain a remission with initial treatment. Recent advances in the delivery of chemotherapy using the intraperitoneal route have further improved survival after initial therapy. Although the majority of ovarian cancer patients will respond to initial chemotherapy, most will ultimately develop disease recurrence. Chemotherapy for recurrent disease includes platinum-based, multiagent regimens for women whose disease recurs more than 6 to 12 months after the completion of initial therapy and sequential single agents for those whose disease recurs earlier. New targeted biologic agents, particularly those involved with the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway and those targeting the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme, hold great promise for improving the outcome of ovarian cancer.","452":"Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are relatively rare tumors that arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. This heterogeneous group of tumors was often considered a single entity. This belied their biological diversity, and the biggest advance in understanding these tumors over the past decades has been in understanding this diversity. Diagnosis of these tumors has been aided by advances in pathological diagnosis and classification and tumor imaging with endoscopic ultrasound and somatostatin receptor fusion imaging. Genetic and molecular advances have identified molecular targets in the treatment of these tumors. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, amply supported by interventional radiological techniques, including embolization. Treatment of metastatic disease has improved significantly with the addition of several new agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and yttrium-90-DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) and lutetium-177-DOTA octreotate. Despite significant advances in the understanding and management of GEP-NETs, the survival of patients remains largely unchanged and there remains a need for the development of national and international research collaborations to spearhead future efforts.","453":"","454":"","455":"Approximately 1.6 million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year throughout the world. In many countries, the mortality related to lung cancer continues to rise. The outcomes for patients with all stages of lung cancer have improved in recent years. The use of systemic therapy in conjunction with local therapy has led to improved cure rates in both resectable and unresectable patient groups. For patients with advanced stage disease, modest but real improvements in overall survival and quality of life have been achieved with systemic chemotherapy. A major focus of research has been the development of molecularly targeted agents and the identification of biomarkers for patient selection. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain achieve response rates of greater than 70% and superior progression-free survival when treated with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor compared with standard chemotherapy. This has now emerged as the preferred therapeutic approach for the subset of patients with a mutation in exons 19 or 21 of the EGFR. Another promising targeted approach involves the use of an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor in patients with a translocation involving the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and -ALK genes. Finally, a paradigm shift in favor of maintenance therapy for patients with advanced stage disease has gained strength from recent data. All of these advances have been made possible by developing a greater understanding of the biology, the discovery of novel anticancer agents, and improved supportive care measures. This article reviews the major strides made in the treatment of lung cancer in the recent past.","456":"The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing adoption of cancer-causing behaviors, particularly smoking, in economically developing countries. Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates, about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56% of the cases and 64% of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23% of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11% of the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally.","457":"","458":"With recent improvements in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, people with cancer are living longer, and their cancer may be managed as a chronic illness. Cancer as a chronic illness places new demands on patients and families to manage their own care, and it challenges old paradigms that oncology's work is done after treatment. As a chronic illness, however, cancer care occurs on a continuum that stretches from prevention to the end of life, with early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship in between. In this article, self-management interventions that enable patients and families to participate in managing their care along this continuum are reviewed. Randomized controlled trials of self-management interventions with cancer patients and families in the treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life phases of the cancer care continuum are reviewed, and the Chronic Care Model is presented as a model of care that oncology practices can use to enable and empower patients and families to engage in self-management. It is concluded that the need for a common language with which to speak about self-management and a common set of self-management actions for cancer care notwithstanding, oncology practices can now build strong relationships with their patients and formulate mutually agreed upon care plans that enable and empower patients to care for themselves in the way they prefer.","459":"Each year the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, a report on data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening. This article summarizes the current ACS guidelines, describes the anticipated impact of new health care reform legislation on cancer screening, and discusses recent public debates over the comparative effectiveness of different colorectal cancer screening tests. The latest data on the utilization of cancer screening from the National Health Interview Survey is described, as well as several recent reports on the role of health care professionals in adult utilization of cancer screening.","460":"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an attractive antitumor target because of its vital role in DNA repair. The homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway is critical for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and HR deficiency leads to a dependency on error-prone DNA repair mechanisms, with consequent genomic instability and oncogenesis. Tumor-specific HR defects may be exploited through a synthetic lethal approach for the application of anticancer therapeutics, including PARP inhibitors. This theory proposes that targeting genetically defective tumor cells with a specific molecular therapy that inhibits its synthetic lethal gene partner should result in selective tumor cell killing. The demonstration of single-agent antitumor activity and the wide therapeutic index of PARP inhibitors in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers with advanced cancers provide strong evidence for the clinical application of this approach. Emerging data also indicate that PARP inhibitors may be effective in sporadic cancers bearing HR defects, supporting a substantially wider role for PARP inhibitors. Drugs targeting this enzyme are now in pivotal clinical trials in patients with sporadic cancers. In this article, the evidence supporting this antitumor synthetic lethal strategy with PARP inhibitors is reviewed, evolving resistance mechanisms and potential molecular predictive biomarker assays are discussed, and the future development of these agents is envisioned.","461":"","462":"","463":"","464":"The first issue of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians was published in November of 1950. On the 60th anniversary of that date, we briefly review several seminal contributions to oncology and cancer control published in our journal during its first decade.","465":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly occurring form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the western world. Until the mid 1990s the incidence of DLBCL increased in both sexes, across racial categories, and across all age groups except the very young, the etiology of most cases remains unknown. DLBCL is associated with an aggressive natural history, but it can be cured with combination chemotherapy regimens like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), which has been the mainstay of therapy for several decades. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival for DLBCL patients with novel combinations of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has uncovered DLBCL subtypes that have distinct clinical behaviors and prognoses, and the addition of the monoclonal antibody, rituximab, to CHOP has markedly improved outcomes. Future approaches to DLBCL management will use molecular signatures identified through GEP to provide prognostic information and to isolate therapeutic targets that are being evaluated for DLBCL patients who relapse or those with high risk disease.","466":"","467":"","468":"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of invasive breast cancer accounting for 2.5% of all breast cancer cases. It is characterized by rapid progression, local and distant metastases, younger age of onset, and lower overall survival compared with other breast cancers. Historically, IBC is a lethal disease with less than a 5% survival rate beyond 5 years when treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Because of its rarity, IBC is often misdiagnosed as mastitis or generalized dermatitis. This review examines IBC's unique clinical presentation, pathology, epidemiology, imaging, and biology and details current multidisciplinary management of the disease, which comprises systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.","469":"Epigenetics refers to stable alterations in gene expression with no underlying modifications in the genetic sequence and is best exemplified by differentiation, in which multiple cell types diverge physiologically despite a common genetic code. Interest in this area of science has grown over the past decades, especially since it was found to play a major role in physiologic phenomena such as embryogenesis, imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation, and in disease states such as cancer. The latter had been previously thought of as a disease with an exclusive genetic etiology. However, recent data have demonstrated that the complexity of human carcinogenesis cannot be accounted for by genetic alterations alone, but also involves epigenetic changes in processes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA expression. In turn, these molecular alterations lead to permanent changes in the expression of genes that regulate the neoplastic phenotype, such as cellular growth and invasiveness. Targeting epigenetic modifiers has been referred to as epigenetic therapy. The success of this approach in hematopoietic malignancies validates the importance of epigenetic alterations in cancer, not only at the therapeutic level but also with regard to prevention, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis.","470":"Family caregivers of cancer patients receive little preparation, information, or support to perform their caregiving role. However, their psychosocial needs must be addressed so they can maintain their own health and provide the best possible care to the patient. The purpose of this article is to analyze the types of interventions offered to family caregivers of cancer patients, and to determine the effect of these interventions on various caregiver outcomes. Meta-analysis was used to analyze data obtained from 29 randomized clinical trials published from 1983 through March 2009. Three types of interventions were offered to caregivers: psychoeducational, skills training, and therapeutic counseling. Most interventions were delivered jointly to patients and caregivers, but they varied considerably with regard to dose and duration. The majority of caregivers were female (64%) and Caucasian (84%), and ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age, 55 years). Meta-analysis indicated that although these interventions had small to medium effects, they significantly reduced caregiver burden, improved caregivers' ability to cope, increased their self-efficacy, and improved aspects of their quality of life. Various intervention characteristics were also examined as potential moderators. Clinicians need to deliver research-tested interventions to help caregivers and patients cope effectively and maintain their quality of life.","471":"","472":"Early detection of malignant melanoma remains the key factor in lowering mortality from this cancer. Recognizing the importance of this issue 25 years ago, our group at New York University published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians the mnemonic \"ABCD\" to facilitate the early diagnosis of melanoma. Studies have demonstrated the usefulness of this paradigm in enhancing early melanoma diagnosis as a part of clinical examinations, mass screenings, and public education programs. Approaches to melanoma diagnosis have dynamically evolved during the ensuing quarter century. In the 1990s, dermoscopy enabled the recognition of new subsurface features to differentiate between malignant and benign pigmented lesions. During the last decade, new computer-based technologies have improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and may result in optimizing lesion selection for biopsy and pathology review. Despite all of the advances in melanoma diagnosis, timely recognition, detection, and rapid treatment of melanoma remain critical. Although pathologic examination remains the gold standard for diagnosis, this cancer has the potential to be diagnosed through noninvasive approaches because of its cutaneous location. From the development of the ABCDs through current attempts that use complex computer algorithms and genetic markers, a clinician's ability to detect melanoma in its earliest form has been augmented. However, a \"good clinical eye\" is still fundamental to selecting the lesions for evaluation among the sea of those that are prevalent. As current approaches are refined and new techniques are developed, the improved ability to diagnose this cancer will hopefully enhance reaching the goal of reducing melanoma mortality.","473":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial\/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian\/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race\/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.","474":"Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer and ranks eighth as a cause of death from cancer among men in the United States. Although guidelines assist in treatment, the art of managing bladder cancer, such as the decision to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the timing of cystectomy, is still variable. Bladder cancer has a propensity to recur, and with recurrence, a significant number of cases progress, which makes the early detection of high-risk patients imperative. Advances in detection, surveillance, and treatment of bladder cancer are reviewed in this article.","475":"Epidemiologic evidence suggests that cancer incidence is associated with diabetes as well as certain diabetes risk factors and treatments. This consensus statement of experts assembled jointly by the American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society reviews the state of science concerning 1) the association between diabetes and cancer incidence or prognosis; 2) risk factors common to both diabetes and cancer; 3) possible biologic links between diabetes and cancer risk; and 4) whether diabetes treatments influence the risk of cancer or cancer prognosis. In addition, key unanswered questions for future research are posed.","476":"Angiogenesis has become an attractive target for drug therapy because of its key role in tumor growth. An extensive array of compounds is currently in preclinical development, with many now entering the clinic and\/or achieving approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Several regulatory and signaling molecules governing angiogenesis are of interest, including growth factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor), receptor tyrosine kinases, and transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor, as well as molecules involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Pharmacologic agents have been identified that target these pathways, yet for some agents (notably thalidomide), an understanding of the specific mechanisms of antitumor action has proved elusive. The following review describes key molecular mechanisms and novel therapies that are on the horizon for antiangiogenic tumor therapy.","477":"","478":"","479":"Malignant gliomas are the most common and deadly brain tumors. Nevertheless, survival for patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive glioma, although individually variable, has improved from an average of 10 months to 14 months after diagnosis in the last 5 years due to improvements in the standard of care. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment of these lesions for decades, and the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved greatly. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent with simple oral administration and a favorable toxicity profile, is used in conjunction with and after radiotherapy. Newer surgical techniques, such as fluorescence-guided resection and neuroendoscopic approaches, have become important in the management of malignant gliomas. Furthermore, new discoveries are being made in basic and translational research, which are likely to improve this situation further in the next 10 years. These include agents that block 1 or more of the disordered tumor proliferation signaling pathways, and that overcome resistance to already existing treatments. Targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic therapy with antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (bevacizumab) are finding their way into clinical practice. Large-scale research efforts are ongoing to provide a comprehensive understanding of all the genetic alterations and gene expression changes underlying glioma formation. These have already refined the classification of glioblastoma into 4 distinct molecular entities that may lead to different treatment regimens. The role of cancer stem-like cells is another area of active investigation. There is definite hope that by 2020, new cocktails of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in gliomas and reduce their mortality and morbidity, a positive development for patients, their families, and medical professionals alike.","480":"Improving the quality of oncologic pathology diagnosis is immensely important as the overwhelming majority of the approximately 1.6 million patients who will be diagnosed with cancer in 2010 have their diagnoses established through the pathologic interpretation of a tissue sample. Millions more patients have tissue samples obtained to rule out cancer and do not have cancer. The majority of studies on the quality of oncologic pathology diagnoses have focused on patient safety and have documented a variety of causes of error that occur in the clinical and pathology laboratory testing phases of diagnostic testing. The reported frequency of a diagnostic error made by oncologic pathology depends on several factors, such as definitions and detection methods, and ranges from 1% to 15%. The large majority of diagnostic errors do not result in severe harm, although mild to moderate harm in the form of additional testing or diagnostic delays occurs in up to 50% of errors. Clinical practitioners play an essential role in error reduction through several avenues such as effective test ordering, providing accurate and pertinent clinical information, procuring high-quality specimens, providing timely follow-up on test results, effectively communicating on potentially discrepant diagnoses, and advocating second opinions on the pathology diagnosis in specific situations.","481":"","482":"","483":"Each year the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, a report on data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening.

In this article, the current ACS guidelines and recent issues are summarized, updates of guidelines for testing for early breast cancer detection by the US Preventive Services Task Force and for prevention and early detection of cervical cancer from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are addressed, and the most recent data from the National Health Interview Survey pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening are described.","484":"","485":"","486":"In 2009, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee began the process of a complete update of recommendations for early prostate cancer detection. A series of systematic evidence reviews was conducted focusing on evidence related to the early detection of prostate cancer, test performance, harms of therapy for localized prostate cancer, and shared and informed decision making in prostate cancer screening. The results of the systematic reviews were evaluated by the ACS Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee, and deliberations about the evidence occurred at committee meetings and during conference calls. On the basis of the evidence and a consensus process, the Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee developed the guideline, and a writing committee drafted a guideline document that was circulated to the entire committee for review and revision. The document was then circulated to peer reviewers for feedback, and finally to the ACS Mission Outcomes Committee and the ACS Board of Directors for approval. The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources. Patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.","487":"The majority of cancer incidence and mortality occurs in individuals aged older than 65 years, and the number of older adults with cancer is projected to significantly increase secondary to the aging of the US population. As such, understanding the changes accompanying age in the context of the cancer patient is of critical importance. Age-related changes can impact tolerance of anticancer therapy and can shift the overall risk-benefit ratio of such treatment. A challenge in implementing evidence-based approaches in older adults is the under-representation of this group in oncology clinical trials. In addition, although older adults are particularly vulnerable to the side effects of cancer therapy, few oncology studies to date have incorporated a measure of health status other than the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group or Karnofsky performance scales. Novel metrics such as frailty indices or the geriatric assessment recognize heterogeneity among older adults, and may allow for risk-adapted approaches to therapy. It is increasingly recognized that several laboratory markers may predict morbidity and mortality in older adults; these biologic variables may further aid in stratifying this group of patients based on risk. This review describes key studies from the geriatric literature that provide principles for assessing health status in the older patient, and ways that these principles can be applied to oncology care in an older population are proposed.","488":"","489":"","490":"","491":"The globalization of tobacco began more than 500 years ago, but the public health response to the death, disease, and economic disruption that it has caused is fewer than 50 years old.

They then discuss the wide range of issues that must be addressed, and the equally wide range of expertise that is needed if the global health community is to be successful in reducing, and eventually eliminating, the rising tide of tobacco use, particularly in the low- and middle-income nations that are the target of the multinational tobacco industry.","492":"Little progress has been made over the last 40 years to eliminate the racial\/ethnic differences in incidence, morbidity, avoidable suffering, and mortality from cancer that result from factors beyond genetic differences. More effective strategies to promote equity in access and quality care are urgently needed because the changing demographics of the United States portend that this disparity will not only persist but significantly increase. Such suffering is avoidable. The authors posit that culture is a prime factor in the persistence of health disparities. However, this concept of culture is still poorly understood, inconsistently defined, and ineffectively used in practice and research. The role of culture in the causal pathway of disparities and the potential impact of culturally competent cancer care on improving cancer outcomes in ethnic minorities has, thus, been underestimated. In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive definition of culture and demonstrate how it can be used at each stage of the cancer care continuum to help reduce the unequal burden of cancer. The authors conclude with suggestions for clinical practice to eliminate the disconnection between evidence-based, quality, cancer care and its delivery to diverse population groups.","493":"","494":"","495":"The use of colonoscopy in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has increased substantially in recent years.

Primary care providers (PCPs) are frequently responsible for making the recommendation and referral for screening. The process of successfully referring a patient for screening colonoscopy can be cumbersome and requires a coordinated effort between the PCP and the endoscopist. In recognition of the potential complexity of this process, the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable has issued a report to describe the components of a quality screening colonoscopy referral system in primary care practice. The elements of a quality program include an optimal scheduling and referral system, the appropriate patient preparation information, consistent reporting and follow-up systems, and a detailed approach to dealing with special situations.","496":"","497":"","498":"","499":"Increases in the number of adult cancer survivors and other issues have forced the oncology community to examine, evaluate, and alter the cancer care paradigm. Pediatric oncologists are grappling with the task of transitioning a growing population of adult survivors of childhood cancer to adult medicine, while oncologists caring for adult cancer survivors are seeking models of follow-up care that are acceptable to patients and providers. Workforce and access-to-care issues suggest that primary care providers will see more cancer survivors in their practices across time, although it is unclear how prepared they are for this task. Translational research is needed to develop evidence-based clinical care and survivorship care plans. A broad picture of the evolving field of adult cancer survivorship is presented. The recent focus on young adult survivors of childhood cancer, an overview of translational research needed to inform the physical and psychosocial care of cancer survivors, and the roles of primary and specialty care providers managing this population is examined. Finally, an overview of evolving treatment summary and care plan initiatives is presented.","500":"Previous studies have documented significant international variations in colorectal cancer rates. However, these studies were limited because they were based on old data or examined only incidence or mortality data. In this article, the colorectal cancer burden and patterns worldwide are described using the most recently updated cancer incidence and mortality data available from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The authors provide 5-year (1998-2002), age-standardized colorectal cancer incidence rates for select cancer registries in IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, and trends in age-standardized death rates by single calendar year for select countries in the World Health Organization mortality database. In addition, available information regarding worldwide colorectal cancer screening initiatives are presented. The highest colorectal cancer incidence rates in 1998-2002 were observed in registries from North America, Oceania, and Europe, including Eastern European countries. These high rates are most likely the result of increases in risk factors associated with \"Westernization,\" such as obesity and physical inactivity. In contrast, the lowest colorectal cancer incidence rates were observed from registries in Asia, Africa, and South America. Colorectal cancer mortality rates have declined in many longstanding as well as newly economically developed countries; however, they continue to increase in some low-resource countries of South America and Eastern Europe. Various screening options for colorectal cancer are available and further international consideration of targeted screening programs and\/or recommendations could help alleviate the burden of colorectal cancer worldwide.","501":"Effective tobacco control efforts have resulted in substantial declines in tobacco use and tobacco-related cancer deaths in the United States. Nearly 40% of reductions in male lung cancer deaths between 1991 and 2003 can be attributed to smoking declines in the last half century. Nevertheless, tobacco use still remains the single, largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United States. Each year, smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke result in nearly half a million premature deaths of which nearly one-third are due to cancer. In a previous report, we described youth and adult smoking prevalence and patterns and discussed policy measures that had proven effective in comprehensive tobacco control. In this report, we update trends in youth and adult smoking prevalence. We find that while adult smoking prevalence has declined overall, socioeconomic gradients in smoking still persist within race and ethnic subgroups. In addition, we describe the diffusion of tobacco-control strategies at the national, state, and community level. Although recent developments, such as the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation of tobacco products, hold promise for tobacco control, there continues to be a need for broader dissemination of sustainably funded comprehensive national and state tobacco-control programs.","502":"","503":"Cancer prevention is central to the mission of the American Cancer Society (ACS). The ACS's prevention activities take many forms, but are primarily focused on modifiable risk factors that have been demonstrated to have the largest impact on cancer risk in the general population (with particular emphasis on tobacco use because of its large impact on cancer), and well-proven policy and program interventions. The ACS addresses nutrition, physical inactivity and obesity, alcohol consumption, excessive sun exposure, prevention of certain chronic infections, and selected other environmental factors through a variety of venues, including consensus guidelines (eg, nutrition and physical activity, human papillomavirus vaccination) and developing educational materials for health care providers and the general public. In contrast to the broad definition of environmental factors used by the ACS and most other public health agencies, some members of the general public associate the term \"environmental\" only with toxic air and water pollutants and other, predominantly manmade, hazards that people encounter, often involuntarily, in their daily life. This article will provide an overview of the ACS's approach to the prevention of cancer associated with such toxic pollutants in the context of its mission and priorities with respect to cancer prevention.","504":"Treatment decision-making can be difficult and complex for patients with low-risk prostate cancer. To the authors' knowledge, there is no consensus regarding an optimal treatment strategy and the choice of therapy involves tradeoffs between differing harms and benefits that are sensitive to patient values. In such situations, patients are often asked to participate actively in the decision-making process, and high-quality decisions require a well-informed patient whose values and preferences have been taken into consideration. Prior studies have indicated that patients have poor knowledge and unrealistic expectations regarding treatment, and physician judgments concerning patient preferences are often inaccurate. Decision aids (DAs) have been developed to help inform patients with low-risk prostate cancer about treatment options and assist in the decision-making process; however, little is currently known regarding the effects of such programs in this population. Thirteen studies of DAs for patients with prostate cancer were reviewed and it was found that the use of DAs can improve knowledge, encourage more active patient involvement in decision-making, and decrease levels of anxiety and distress. The effect of DAs on treatment choice was less clear, although fewer patients chose surgery compared with historical controls, particularly in Europe. Further studies are needed to determine how best to implement DAs into practice, and whether they improve the consistency between patient preferences and treatment choice.","505":"","506":"Palliative and end-of-life care is changing in the United States. This dynamic field is improving care for patients with serious and life-threatening cancer through creation of national guidelines for quality care, multidisciplinary educational offerings, research endeavors, and resources made available to clinicians. Barriers to implementing quality palliative care across cancer populations include a rapidly expanding population of older adults who will need cancer care and a decrease in the workforce available to give care. Methods of integrating current palliative care knowledge into care of patients include multidisciplinary national education and research endeavors, and clinician resources. Acceptance of palliative care as a recognized medical specialty provides a valuable resource for improvement of care. Although compilation of evidence for the importance of palliative care specialities is in its initial stages, national research grants have provided support to build the knowledge necessary for appropriate palliative care. Opportunities are available to clinicians for understanding and applying appropriate palliative and end-of-life care to patients with serious and life-threatening cancers.","507":"Traditionally, pathologic determinations of tumor size, lymph node status, endocrine receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status have driven prognostic predictions and adjuvant therapy recommendations for patients with early stage breast cancer. However, these prognostic and predictive factors are relatively crude measures, resulting in many patients being overtreated or undertreated. As a result of gene expression assays, there is growing recognition that breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. Evidence from gene expression microarrays suggests the presence of multiple molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The recent commercial availability of gene expression profiling techniques that predict risk of disease recurrence as well as potential chemotherapy benefit have shown promise in refining clinical decision making. These techniques will be reviewed in this article.","508":"The US Public Health Service Guideline for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence 2008 Update emphasizes tobacco use as a chronic medical disorder; highlights both behavioral counseling and the use of 1 or more of the 7 approved medications; and points out the utility, efficacy, and reach of telephone quitlines. The treatment of users of smokeless tobacco continues to be less than optimal. Although providing evidence-based treatment for tobacco- dependent patients is a challenge for busy physicians, a team approach including trained and certified tobacco treatment specialists (TTS) provides an efficient treatment model. TTS represent a new and growing part of the health care team and hold great potential for expanding the collective tobacco treatment expertise in the medical setting. The effective treatment of tobacco dependence frequently requires tailoring, and often intensifying, interventions (both counseling and pharmacotherapy) to meet the needs of the individual patient.","509":"","510":"","511":"","512":"","513":"Randomized controlled trials have shown equivalent survival for women with early stage breast cancer who are treated with breast-conservation therapy (local excision and radiotherapy) or mastectomy. Decades of experience have demonstrated that breast-conservation therapy provides excellent local control based on defined standards of care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been introduced in preoperative staging of the affected breast in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer because it detects additional foci of cancer that are occult on conventional imaging. The median incremental (additional) detection for MRI has been estimated as 16% in meta-analysis. In the absence of consensus on the role of preoperative MRI, we review data on its detection capability and its impact on treatment. We outline that the assumptions behind the adoption of MRI, namely that it will improve surgical planning and will lead to a reduction in re-excision surgery and in local recurrences, have not been substantiated by trials. Evidence consistently shows that MRI changes surgical management, usually from breast conservation to more radical surgery; however, there is no evidence that it improves surgical care or prognosis. Emerging data indicate that MRI does not reduce re-excision rates and that it causes false positives in terms of detection and unnecessary surgery; overall there is little high-quality evidence at present to support the routine use of preoperative MRI. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the clinical, psychosocial, and long-term effects of MRI and to show a related change in treatment from standard care in women newly affected by breast cancer.","514":"In the United States, prostate cancer will affect 1 man in 6 during his lifetime. Since the mid-1980s, screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test has more than doubled the risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. A decrease in prostate cancer death rates has been observed since that time, but the relative contribution of PSA testing as opposed to other factors, such as improved treatment, has been uncertain. The recent release of 2 large randomized trials suggests that if there is a benefit of screening, it is, at best, small. Methods to assess a man's risk of prostate cancer, including those tools that integrate multiple risk factors, are now available and should be used in risk assessment. Men undergoing screening for prostate cancer may reduce their risk of prostate cancer with finasteride.","515":"","516":"","517":"","518":"Patients with advanced cancer face difficult decisions regarding their treatment, and many will need to make difficult choices about end-of-life care because although cancer-directed therapies are increasingly available, few provide a cure. High-quality cancer care includes access to palliative care throughout the cancer care continuum, and increasing evidence suggests that timely enrollment in hospice can increase quality of life for patients dying from cancer. Therefore, clinicians must learn to recognize patients who are hospice-eligible and to develop prognostication and communication skills that enable honest provider-patient dialogue about end-of-life options. In this article, the authors review available tools for prognostication in advanced cancer and present a method for discussing prognosis by using the SPIKES acronym. In addition, by using patient-identified goals and service needs, the authors recommend a method for making a hospice referral after disclosure of poor prognosis.","519":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are standardized by age to the 2000 United States standard million population. A total of 1,479,350 new cancer cases and 562,340 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2009. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.8% per year from 2001 to 2005) and women (0.6% per year from 1998 to 2005), largely because of decreases in the three major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and in two major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). Overall cancer death rates decreased in men by 19.2% between 1990 and 2005, with decreases in lung (37%), prostate (24%), and colorectal (17%) cancer rates accounting for nearly 80% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2005 decreased by 11.4%, with decreases in breast (37%) and colorectal (24%) cancer rates accounting for 60% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates has resulted in the avoidance of about 650,000 deaths from cancer over the 15-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race\/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years of age. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.","520":"The authors systematically reviewed the association between provider case volume and mortality in 101 publications involving greater than 1 million patients with esophageal, gastric, hepatic, pancreatic, colon, or rectal cancer, of whom more than 70,000 died. The majority of studies addressed the relation between hospital surgical case volume and short-term perioperative mortality. Few studies addressed surgeon case volume or evaluated long-term survival outcomes. Common methodologic limitations were failure to control for potential confounders, post hoc categorization of provider volume, and unit of analysis errors. A significant volume effect was evident for the majority of gastrointestinal cancers; with each doubling of hospital case volume, the odds of perioperative death decreased by 0.1 to 0.23. The authors calculated that between 10 and 50 patients per year, depending on cancer type, needed to be moved from a \"low-volume\" hospital to a \"high-volume\" hospital to prevent 1 additional volume-associated perioperative death. Despite this, approximately one-third of all analyses did not find a significant volume effect on mortality. The heterogeneity of results from individual studies calls into question the validity of case volume as a proxy for care quality, and leads the authors to conclude that more direct quality measures and the validity of their use to inform policy should also be explored.","521":"","522":"According to the 2008 World Health Organization classification system for hematologic malignancies, the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) include chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, mastocytosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia-not otherwise specified, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and \"MPN, unclassifiable.\" All of these clinicopathologic entities are characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation, and their phenotypic diversity is ascribed to the occurrence of distinct oncogenic events. In the last 4 years, new JAK2 and MPL mutations have been added to previously described ABL and KIT mutations as molecular markers of disease in MPN. These discoveries have markedly simplified the approach to clinical diagnosis and have also provided molecular targets for the development of small-molecule drugs. In the current article, the authors provide a clinically oriented overview of MPNs in terms of their molecular pathogenesis, classification, diagnosis, and management.","523":"","524":"Because local therapies directed toward a specific tumor mass are known to be effective for treating early-stage cancers, it should be no surprise that there has been considerable historical experience using local therapies for metastatic disease. In more recent years, increasing interest in the use of local therapy for metastases likely has arisen from improvements in systemic therapy. In the absence of effective systemic therapies, such local treatments were often considered futile given both the difficulty in eliminating all sites of identifiable metastatic disease as well as realities regarding the rapid natural history of uncontrolled tumor dissemination. However, with a higher likelihood of patients surviving longer after effective systemic therapy, even if not cured, the goal of the eradication of residual metastases via potent local therapies can be rationalized. However, this rationalization should be evidence-based so as to avoid harming patients for no established benefit. Although surgical metastectomy remains the most common and first-line standard among local therapies, nonsurgical alternatives, including thermal ablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy, have become increasingly popular because they are generally less invasive than surgery and have demonstrated considerable promise in eradicating macroscopic tumor. Rather than eliminating the need for local therapies, improvements in systemic therapies appear to be increasing the prudent utilization of modern local therapies in patients presenting with more advanced cancer.","525":"Although cancer remains a devastating diagnosis, several decades of preclinical progress in cancer biology and biotechnology have recently led to successful development of several biological agents that substantially improve survival and quality of life for some patients. There is now a rich pipeline of novel anticancer agents in early phase clinical trials. The specific tumor and stromal aberrancies targeted can be conceptualized as membrane-bound receptor kinases (HGF\/c-Met, human epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin growth factor receptor pathways), intracellular signaling kinases (Src, PI3k\/Akt\/mTOR, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways), epigenetic abnormalities (DNA methyltransferase and histyone deacetylase), protein dynamics (heat shock protein 90, ubiquitin-proteasome system), and tumor vasculature and microenvironment (angiogenesis, HIF, endothelium, integrins). Several technologies are available to target these abnormalities. Of these, monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors have been the more successful, and often complementary, approaches so far in clinical settings. The success of this target-based cancer drug development approach is discussed with examples of recently approved agents, such as bevacizumab, erlotinib, trastuzumab, sorafenib, and bortezomib. This review also highlights the pipeline of rationally designed drugs in clinical development that have the potential to impact clinical care in the near future.","526":"In the adult population, thyroid nodules are common and are increasingly detected by ultrasound examination or other scanning techniques. Depending on their size and ultrasonographic features, these nodules may require further investigation, including tissue diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has become the predominant method to obtain tissue for microscopic analysis. In October 2007, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a conference to review the state of the science for the use of FNA in the management of thyroid nodules. This conference reviewed indications for thyroid FNA and pre-FNA requirements, training and credentialing, techniques for thyroid FNA, diagnostic terminology and morphologic criteria, utilization of ancillary studies, and post-FNA testing and treatment options. The results of those discussions have been published in both print and electronic versions. The aim of the current article was to discuss indications for FNA, diagnostic terminology, and post-FNA options, issues that are important to physicians who are managing patients with thyroid nodules.","527":"","528":"","529":"The skin often mirrors changes in the organism it envelops. Many neoplastic diseases that affect internal organs display cutaneous manifestations, which may be the presenting signs and symptoms of the underlying malignancy. These may reflect direct involvement of the skin by the tumor (ie, tumor metastasis) or indirect involvement, in which changes in the skin occur in the absence of malignant cells. This review focuses on the latter conditions, which are often referred to as paraneoplastic dermatoses. Included in the discussion are the cutaneous manifestations of inherited syndromes that are associated with an increased risk of internal malignancy, cutaneous changes in patients with hormone-secreting tumors, and the wide spectrum of proliferative and inflammatory dermatoses that have been associated with internal cancer.","530":"Given the recent significant increase in the use of oral therapies in cancer management, an understanding of patients' adherence to and persistence with oral therapy is crucial. Nonadherence and early cessation may be substantial barriers to the delivery of valuable therapies, and may impair health. Potential obstacles to adherence and persistence include personal characteristics, treatment features, and system factors. Techniques for measuring adherence and persistence include self-report, pill counts, microelectronic monitoring systems (MEMS), prescription database analysis, and the assessment of serum or urine drug levels. This review article describes available data regarding adherence and persistence among patients with cancer, as well as studies of interventions to improve adherence. All reports of studies of adherence with oral cancer therapy that the authors could find on PubMed or in the reference sections of these PubMed-located articles were included. Adherence and persistence rates ranged from 16% to 100% with different therapies and different methods of measurement. Studies that included educational, behavioral, and multidimensional interventions to improve adherence were also described.","531":"Large interindividual variation is observed in both the response and toxicity associated with anticancer therapy. The etiology of this variation is multifactorial, but is due in part to host genetic variations. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies have successfully identified genetic variants that contribute to this variation in susceptibility to chemotherapy. This review provides an overview of the progress made in the field of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics using a five-stage architecture, which includes 1) determining the role of genetics in drug response; 2) screening and identifying genetic markers; 3) validating genetic markers; 4) clinical utility assessment; and 5) pharmacoeconomic impact. Examples are provided to illustrate the identification, validation, utility, and challenges of these pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic markers, with the focus on the current application of this knowledge in cancer therapy. With the advance of technology, it becomes feasible to evaluate the human genome in a relatively inexpensive and efficient manner; however, extensive pharmacogenetic research and education are urgently needed to improve the translation of pharmacogenetic concepts from bench to bedside.","532":"Each year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a report summarizing its recommendations for early cancer detection, data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening. In 2008, the ACS, the American Gastroenterological Association, the American College of Gastroenterology, the Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the American College of Radiology issued a joint update of guidelines for colorectal cancer screening in average-risk adults. In this issue, the current ACS guidelines and recent issues are summarized, updates of testing guidelines for early prostate cancer detection and colorectal cancer screening by the United States Preventive Services Task Force are discussed, and the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening are described.","533":"","534":"The primary goals of oncologic therapy are the compassionate care of cancer patients, eradication of disease, and palliation of symptoms. Advances in various targeted therapies such as highly conformal and image-guided radiotherapy techniques, sentinel lymph node dissection, and molecularly targeted agents hold the promise of allowing those goals to be reached with fewer treatment-related complications. Unfortunately, certain side effects remain problematic due to the inability to completely avoid injuring normal tissues. Lymphedema, a chronic condition that occurs as a result of the body's inability to drain lymph fluid from the tissues, is a common treatment-related side effect experienced by cancer patients. In this review, many of the important aspects of lymphedema with which clinicians who treat cancer patients should be familiar are outlined, including the anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of this condition. The authors also identify some of the resources available both to cancer patients with lymphedema and to the clinicians who treat them. It is hoped that this review will convey the importance of the early identification and management of this incurable disorder because this is essential to minimizing its complications.","535":"","536":"","537":"","538":"Due to the high incidence of breast cancer among US females, risk-reduction strategies are essential. Before considering approaches to breast cancer risk reduction, it is important for clinicians to complete individualized qualitative and quantitative assessments of risk for their patients in order to inform physicians' clinical decision making and management and to engage patients collaboratively in a thorough discussion of risks and benefits. This review will summarize information on potential pharmacologic, nutritional, surgical, and behavioral approaches to reducing breast cancer risk. While there is no clear evidence that specific dietary components can effectively reduce breast cancer risk, weight gain and obesity in adulthood are risk factors for the development of postmenopausal breast cancer. Alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, increases breast cancer risk, although some of the detrimental effects may be reduced by sufficient folate intake. Women at increased risk of breast cancer can opt to reduce their breast cancer risk through the use of tamoxifen or raloxifene; other chemopreventive agents remain under investigation. Surgical approaches to risk reductions are restricted to those patients with a substantially increased risk of developing breast cancer. Patients should be encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle for their overall well-being and to remain up to date with recommendations for screening and surveillance.","539":"Adequate vascular access is of paramount importance in oncology patients. It is important in the initial phase of surgical treatment or chemotherapy, as well as in the chronic management of advanced cancer and in the palliative care setting. We present an overview of the available vascular access devices and of the most relevant issues regarding insertion and management of vascular access. Particular emphasis is given to the use of ultrasound guidance as the preferred technique of insertion, which has dramatically decreased insertion-related complications. Vascular access management has considerably improved after the publication of effective guidelines for the appropriate nursing of the vascular device, which has reduced the risk of late complications, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection. However, many areas of clinical practice are still lacking an evidence-based background, such as the choice of the most appropriate vascular access device in each clinical situation, as well as prevention and treatment of thrombosis. We suggest an approach to the choice of the most appropriate vascular access device for the oncology patient, based on the literature available to date.","540":"","541":"","542":"","543":"The Cancer Quality Alliance (CQA), a national alliance advocating for improvements in the quality of cancer care in America, presents a set of 5 case studies that depict a vision of quality cancer care and a \"Blueprint\" for actions to realize this vision. The CQA Blueprint case studies feature patients with soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, rectal cancer, and Hodgkin disease and focus on key phases in the cancer care trajectory: detection, diagnosis, treatment, post-treatment\/survivorship, and end of life. Each case study begins with a patient summary, follows with a worst- and a best-case scenario, and concludes with a discussion section identifying \"what went right\" in the best case and \"what went wrong\" in the worst case. Steps to be taken by key stakeholders, for example, health care providers, insurers\/payers, policy makers, and patients and families, are then outlined. By juxtaposing a worst- and best-case scenario, the cancer care case studies elucidate the origins of complex health care problems and clarify the actions needed to overcome them. The CQA will make the case studies available for use as teaching tools to give health care providers and patients themselves descriptions of how the health care system should work to achieve the ultimate benefit for an individual living with, through, and beyond a diagnosis of cancer. The CQA adopted the definition of quality health care of the Institute of Medicine, and the analysis of care provided in the discussion section of each case study is framed using 6 quality improvement aims identified in the Institute of Medicine's report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century. Health care quality may be judged according to its safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity.","544":"Although cancer management is becoming more structured with disease-specific guidelines and clinical pathways, many decisions remain complex. Contributing to this complexity is the need to make value tradeoffs between benefits and harms across cancer treatment and\/or screening options. Since there is no \"best\" option for everyone, decisions are defined as being of higher quality when informed with the latest scientific evidence and based on patients' informed values associated with outcomes of options. However, clinicians are not good judges of patients' values, and patients often have inadequate knowledge, unrealistic expectations, and decisional conflict that interfere with their involvement in decision making. Effective approaches to support patient involvement into clinical decisions include clinicians trained in shared decision making, question prompt sheets, patient decision aids, and decision coaching by nurses and other allied health professionals. Based on systematic review of 23 randomized trials of cancer patient decision aids, patients exposed to decision aids are more likely to participate in decision making and achieve higher-quality decisions. This review highlights key historical changes leading to patient involvement in decision making, summarizes evidence on effective interventions to support shared decision making, explores strategies to implement these interventions in oncology practices, and identifies future directions.","545":"Follicular lymphoma is often managed as an incurable disease. However, a substantial and growing fraction of patients are achieving long-term disease-free survival from aggressive treatment approaches. The application of novel therapeutic tools, including monoclonal antibodies, radioimmunotherapy, and vaccines, as well as new and more active chemotherapeutic agents, is producing complete responses in the majority of treated patients, with a 2-fold increase in disease- and progression-free survival in randomized trials. For some of these treatment approaches, follow up has not yet been long enough to determine a median response duration, but it certainly exceeds the \"2 to 3 years\" that is routinely stated as dogma to patients with this illness. Furthermore, some patients remain in complete remission beyond a decade from their initial treatment, implying that the assumption of inevitable relapse also must be challenged. One clear fact is that no patients will ever be cured by adopting a palliative treatment approach. The assumption that patients with follicular lymphoma are incurable is certain to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Here the author summarizes the large and growing body of knowledge that suggests an expectant approach to management is not appropriate for all patients.","546":"While the past decade has seen the development of multiple new interventions to diagnose and treat cancer, as well as to improve the quality of life for cancer patients, many of these interventions have substantial costs. This has resulted in increased scrutiny of the costs of care for cancer, as well as the costs relative to the benefits for cancer treatments. It is important for oncologists and other members of the cancer community to consider and understand how economic evaluations of cancer interventions are performed and to be able to use and critique these evaluations. This review discusses the components, main types, and analytic issues of health economic evaluations using studies of cancer interventions as examples. We also highlight limitations of these economic evaluations and discuss why members of the cancer community should care about economic analyses.","547":"Psychosocial care is increasingly recognized as an essential component of the comprehensive care of the individual with cancer. Improving patients' access to psychosocial care is important; however, ensuring that the care made available has been shown to be effective is just as important. Accordingly, the goal of this review is to describe an evidence-based approach to the psychosocial care of adults with cancer. The focus is on anxiety and depression because a considerable body of research has examined the impact of psychosocial interventions on these outcomes. After describing the sources, assessment, and prevalence of anxiety and depression in adults with cancer and presenting existing clinical practice guidelines for their management, previous publications that systematically reviewed evidence of the efficacy of psychosocial interventions are summarized. The use of these publications to derive specific recommendations for the use of psychosocial interventions in the management of anxiety and depression is then illustrated. In addition, examples are provided of interventions that are effective against anxiety and depression and have good potential for dissemination in routine clinical practice. The review concludes with a discussion of future directions for the continued development of an evidence-based approach to the psychosocial care of people with cancer.","548":"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in men in the United States. Treatment of men with prostate cancer commonly involves surgical, radiation, or hormone therapy. Most men with prostate cancer live for many years after diagnosis and may never suffer morbidity or mortality attributable to prostate cancer. The short-term and long-term adverse consequences of therapy are, therefore, of great importance. Adverse effects of radical prostatectomy include immediate postoperative complications and long-term urinary and sexual complications. External beam or interstitial radiation therapy in men with localized prostate cancer may lead to urinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual complications. Improvements in surgical and radiation techniques have reduced the incidence of many of these complications. Hormone treatment typically consists of androgen deprivation therapy, and consequences of such therapy may include vasomotor flushing, anemia, and bone density loss. Numerous clinical trials have studied the role of bone antiresorptive therapy for prevention of bone density loss and fractures. Other long-term consequences of androgen deprivation therapy may include adverse body composition changes and increased risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will continue to address strategies to prevent treatment-related side effects and improve quality of life for men with prostate cancer.","549":"The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification describes the anatomic extent of cancer. The ability to separately classify the individual T, N, and M elements and then group them into stages differs from other cancer staging classifications, which are primarily concerned with summarized groups. The objectives of the TNM system are to aid clinicians and investigators in planning treatment, assessing prognosis, stratifying patients for therapeutic studies, evaluating the results of treatment, and facilitating communication. The most important challenge facing TNM is how to interface the current taxonomy with the numerous nonanatomic prognostic factors currently in use or under study. As nonanatomic prognostic factors become widely used, TNM will remain a solid foundation on which to build prognostic classifications. There is, however, a risk that this system will be corrupted by a variety of irrelevant prognostic data. An anatomic extent of disease classification is needed to provide a standard against which to measure the importance of nonanatomic factors. Methods are needed to express overall prognosis without losing the vital anatomic content of TNM. These methods should be able to integrate multiple prognostic factors, including TNM, yet permit TNM to remain intact and distinct.","550":"Each year the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection and a summary of the most current data on cancer screening rates and trends in US adults. In 2007, the ACS updated its colorectal cancer screening guidelines in a collaborative effort with the US Multi-Society Task Force and the American College of Radiology. In this issue of the journal, we summarize the current ACS guidelines, provide an update of the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey, and address some issues related to access to care.","551":"Bone metastases, especially to the spine, are frequently encountered during the course of a malignancy. Due to a worldwide increase of cancer incidence and to a longer life expectancy of patients with cancer, a rise in incidence of bone metastases is observed. A brief historical overview is the base of a review of current treatment options. Despite new developments in the surgical and radiotherapeutic fields, as well as in medical oncology, external beam radiotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of spinal metastases. In selected cases, surgical treatment is a proven option. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty can also be considered. Supportive medical care does not differ from that given for symptomatic lesions to the skeletal system elsewhere in the body. After discussing the treatment options, an algorithm is given.","552":"In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed among men and women and the second leading cause of death from cancer. CRC largely can be prevented by the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps, and survival is significantly better when CRC is diagnosed while still localized. In 2006 to 2007, the American Cancer Society, the US Multi Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology came together to develop consensus guidelines for the detection of adenomatous polyps and CRC in asymptomatic average-risk adults. In this update of each organization's guidelines, screening tests are grouped into those that primarily detect cancer early and those that can detect cancer early and also can detect adenomatous polyps, thus providing a greater potential for prevention through polypectomy. When possible, clinicians should make patients aware of the full range of screening options, but at a minimum they should be prepared to offer patients a choice between a screening test that is effective at both early cancer detection and cancer prevention through the detection and removal of polyps and a screening test that primarily is effective at early cancer detection. It is the strong opinion of these 3 organizations that colon cancer prevention should be the primary goal of screening.","553":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,437,180 new cancer cases and 565,650 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2008. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality include stabilization of incidence rates for all cancer sites combined in men from 1995 through 2004 and in women from 1999 through 2004 and a continued decrease in the cancer death rate since 1990 in men and since 1991 in women. Overall cancer death rates in 2004 compared with 1990 in men and 1991 in women decreased by 18.4% and 10.5%, respectively, resulting in the avoidance of over a half million deaths from cancer during this time interval. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race\/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. Although much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates, stabilizing incidence rates, and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.","554":"Accurate disease staging of patients with pancreatic cancer is essential to divide patients into prognostic subgroups, to allow delivery of stage-specific therapies, and to facilitate meaningful discussions between physicians and patients regarding management and expected outcomes. The tumor-node-metastasis staging system of the American Joint Commission on Cancer has undergone significant revisions over the past 2 decades. In its current form, the system places an emphasis on preoperative clinical staging and facilitates division of patients with pancreatic cancer into 4 groups based on a determination of local resectability and the presence or absence of distant disease as determined on high-quality cross-sectional imaging. A modern understanding of local tumor factors that influence technical resectability is incorporated into the algorithm. In this review, we examine the American Joint Commission on Cancer staging system, describe the rationale for its use, and demonstrate how it is a clinically relevant tool for the staging and management of patients with pancreatic cancer.","555":"Recent developments in nanotechnology have provided researchers with new tools for cancer imaging and treatment. This technology has enabled the development of nanoscale devices that can be conjugated with several functional molecules simultaneously, including tumor-specific ligands, antibodies, anticancer drugs, and imaging probes. Since these nanodevices are 100 to 1,000-fold smaller than cancer cells, they can be easily transferred through leaky blood vessels and interact with targeted tumor-specific proteins both on the surface of and inside cancer cells. Therefore, their application as cancer cell-specific delivery vehicles will be a significant addition to the currently available armory for cancer therapeutics and imaging.","556":"The Sixth Edition of the tumor-node-metastasis staging system for prostate cancer attempts to provide a helpful staging paradigm for clinicians. Accurate staging is critical not only for managing individual patients, but also for ascertaining trends in disease pattern in a large population of patients with prostate cancer. Several modifications have been made in an attempt to improve the cohesiveness and uniformity of patient evaluation and to aid in future meaningful clinical research. As data are accumulated and analysis continues, ongoing critical evaluation of this staging system will undoubtedly incorporate new evidence-based factors and bring about future refinements to prostate cancer staging.","557":"The multidisciplinary approach to treating squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is complex and evolving. This article aims to review some recent developments in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, in particular the expanding role of chemotherapy in its management. Surgery and radiotherapy have remained the mainstay of therapy. Chemotherapy is increasingly being incorporated into the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Previously, radiotherapy following surgery was the standard approach to the treatment of locoregionally advanced resectable disease. Data from randomized trials have confirmed the benefits of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Chemoradiotherapy is also the recommended approach for unresectable disease. Induction chemotherapy has been useful in resectable disease where organ preservation is desirable, but this approach was inferior for the goal of larynx preservation, while leading to similar survival when compared with concomitant chemoradiotherapy. There is recent evidence that taxanes added to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil result in improved survival outcomes. Novel targeted agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists, are showing promise in the treatment of patients with both locoregionally advanced and recurrent\/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","558":"","559":"Advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer have resulted in an almost 14% decrease in the death rates from all cancers combined from 1991 to 2004 in the overall US population, with remarkable declines in mortality for the top 3 causes of cancer death in men (lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer) and 2 of the top 3 cancers in women (breast and colorectal cancer). However, not all segments of the population have benefited equally from this progress, and evidence suggests that some of these differences are related to lack of access to health care. Lack of adequate health insurance appears to be a critical barrier to receipt of appropriate health care services. This article provides an overview of systems of health insurance in the United States, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics associated with health insurance coverage, and economic burdens related to health care among individuals and families. This article also presents data on the association between health insurance status and screening, stage at diagnosis, and survival for breast and colorectal cancer based on analyses of the National Health Interview Survey and the National Cancer Data Base. Although this article focuses on associations between health insurance and cancer care utilization and outcomes, it is important to recognize that barriers to receipt of optimal cancer care are complex and involve patient-level, provider, and health system factors. Evidence presented in this paper suggests that addressing insurance and cost-related barriers to care is a critical component of efforts to ensure that all Americans are able to share in the progress that can be achieved by access to high-quality cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment services.","560":"In order to provide appropriate individual and community support for cancer survivors, there is a great need to better understand how people who have survived cancer or other serious illness adapt positively to health challenges and to identify effective approaches for helping people cope with health challenges over their lifetime. Studies have identified a number of personal factors that are associated with resilience, increased quality of life, and positive adaptation to illness. Of particular interest is the ability of individuals to survive or even thrive despite an adverse event, as influenced by both individual factors such as resiliency and external factors like social support. The experience of having a potentially life-threatening illness can lead to positive adaptation and increased ability to thrive despite difficult circumstances. The cancer survivorship movement and the cancer community in general provide important resources for improving quality of life and alleviating human suffering and distress among patients and survivors and for adding personal meaning and hope to people's lives.","561":"Clean indoor air laws are easily implemented, are well accepted by the public, reduce nonsmoker exposure to secondhand smoke, and contribute to a reduction in overall cigarette consumption. There are currently thousands of clean indoor air laws throughout the Unites States, and the majority of Americans live in areas where smoking is completely prohibited in workplaces, restaurants, or bars. The vast majority of scientific evidence indicates that there is no negative economic impact of clean indoor air policies, with many studies finding that there may be some positive effects on local businesses. This is despite the fact that tobacco industry-sponsored research has attempted to create fears to the contrary. Further progress in the diffusion of clean indoor air laws will depend on the continued documentation of the economic impact of clean indoor air laws, particularly within the hospitality industry. This article reviews the spread of clean indoor air laws, the effect on public health, and the scientific evidence of the economic impact of implementation of clean indoor air laws.","562":"A recommendation from a physician is the most influential factor in determining whether a patient is screened for colorectal cancer. While the vast majority of primary care physicians report that they screen for colorectal cancer, many patients do not receive the recommendation they need. Evidence-based strategies can help the physician ensure that every appropriate patient leaves the office with the needed recommendation. Choosing an office system that can be implemented by the physician or office staff can fuel efforts to achieve higher screening rates. Reminder systems, tracking systems, communication strategies, and policies that reinforce use of evidence-based guidelines may contribute.","563":"The National Institutes of Health reports that 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, including pain associated with the disease of cancer. Painful conditions can strike anyone, including cancer patients and cancer survivors. Unrelieved severe pain can limit a person's functioning and sometimes even destroy the will to live. When the quality of pain relief provided is inadequate, it is usually the result of failures to apply existing knowledge about pain and its treatment, including the appropriate use of opioids. But pain relief also can be affected by the regulatory environment and fear of being investigated for excessive prescribing. The importance of evaluating and improving policies governing pain management has been recognized by national and international authorities, including the Institute of Medicine and the World Health Organization. A pilot examination of state laws and regulatory policies demonstrated that they contained a number of outdated medical concepts and prescribing restrictions and did not contain key elements of law that can make pain management a priority for licensed medical practitioners. The Pain &amp; Policy Studies Group developed a research program to evaluate US federal and state policy governing the medical use of pain medication. This article describes 3 national policy evaluations and how the results are being used to document improvements in state pain policies. An emerging role for clinicians and their professional organizations to improve their state's pain policies is discussed.","564":"In 1998, the American Cancer Society (ACS) set a challenge goal for the nation to reduce cancer incidence by 25% over the period between 1992 and 2015. This report examines the trends in cancer incidence between 1992 and 2004. Trends were calculated using data on incident malignant cancer cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry. Delay-adjusted incidence trends for all cancer sites; all cancer sites without prostate cancer included; all cancer sites stratified by gender, age, and race; and for 20 selected cancer sites are presented. Over the first half of the ACS challenge period, overall cancer incidence rates have declined by about 0.6% per year. The greatest overall declines were observed among men and among those aged 65 years and older. The pace of incidence reduction over the first half of the ACS challenge period was only half that necessary to put us on target to achieve the 25% cancer incidence reduction goal in 2015. New understandings of preventable factors are needed, and new efforts are also needed to better act on our current knowledge about how we can prevent cancer, especially by continuing to reduce tobacco use and beginning to reverse the epidemic of obesity.","565":"","566":"","567":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable clonal B-cell malignancy with terminally differentiated plasma cells. It afflicts approximately 55,000 people in the United States. Over the past 5 years, significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and assessment of patients with MM. Significant advances include a simplified staging system, which has replaced the more cumbersome Durie-Salmon staging system; an updated uniform international response criteria; the development of a sensitive new serum test to detect free light chain production (free light chain assay); the recognition of specific adverse cytogenetic abnormalities; and the evolution of genomics, which will identify specific and targeted therapies for individual MM patients. For the first time in decades, major therapeutic advances have been implemented in the treatment of MM patients. These include 2 new classes of agent: immunomodulatory drugs and proteosome inhibitors. In addition, clinical trials have solidified the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplant and established the benefits of post-transplant maintenance therapy. Finally, a number of new agents are in development that specifically target the myeloma cells and\/or the bone marrow microenvironment. These advances have resulted in expanded treatment options, prolonged disease control and survival, and improved quality of life for patients with MM.","568":"There is growing recognition that patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures--encompassing, for example, health-related quality of life--can complement traditional biomedical outcome measures (eg, survival, disease-free survival) in conveying important information for cancer care decision making. This paper provides an integrated review and interpretation of how PROs have been defined, measured, and used in a range of recent cancer research and policy initiatives. We focus, in turn, on the role of PRO measurement in the evaluation and approval of cancer therapies, the assessment of cancer care in the community, patient-provider decision making in clinical oncology practice, and population surveillance of cancer patients and survivors. The paper concludes with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities in PRO measure development and application, given the advancing state of the science in cancer outcomes measurement and the evolving needs of cancer decision makers at all levels.","569":"Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived substances that are structurally or functionally similar to estradiol. Interest in phytoestrogens has been fueled by epidemiologic data that suggest a decreased risk of breast cancer in women from countries with high phytoestrogen consumption. Women with a history of breast cancer may seek out these \"natural\" hormones in the belief that they are safe or perhaps even protective against recurrence. Interpretation of research studies regarding phytoestrogen intake and breast cancer risk is hampered by differences in dietary measurement, lack of standardization of supplemental sources, differences in metabolism amongst individuals, and the retrospective nature of much of the research in this area. Data regarding the role of phytoestrogens in breast cancer prevention is conflicting, but suggest early exposure in childhood or early adolescence may be protective. In several placebo-controlled randomized trials among breast cancer survivors, soy has not been found to decrease menopausal symptoms. There is very little human data on the role of phytoestrogens in preventing breast cancer recurrence, but the few studies conducted do not support a protective role. There is in vivo animal data suggesting the phytoestrogen genistein may interfere with the inhibitive effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer cell growth.","570":"One in every 168 Americans develops invasive cancer between age 15 to 30 years. During this age interval, cancer is unique in the distribution of types that occur and rarely related to either environmental carcinogens, a recognizable inherited predisposition, or a family cancer syndrome. Patients in this age group have the lowest rate of health insurance coverage, frequent delays in diagnosis, and the lowest accrual to clinical trials. Their psychosocial needs are unique and generally less well attended to than in any other age group. Despite an intrinsically equal ability to tolerate chemotherapy, older adolescents and young adults frequently receive lower dose intensities than do younger patients, and at times less than in older patients. Whereas the 15- to 29-year age group once had a better overall survival rate than either younger or older patients, a relative lack of progress has resulted in the majority of cancers in the age group having a worse overall survival rate than in younger patients, and several of these having a worse prognosis than in older patients. Against this background, young adults with cancer have unique survival challenges--medically, psychosocially, and economically--that are now beginning to be appreciated and addressed with a national initiative.","571":"The last decade has seen an explosion in knowledge of the molecular basis and treatment of cancer. The molecular events that define the lethal phenotype of various cancers--the genetic and cellular alterations that lead to a cancer with a poor or incurable prognosis--are being defined. While these studies describe the cellular events of the lethal phenotype of cancer in detail, how these events result in the common clinical syndromes that kill the majority of cancer patients is not well understood. It is clear that the central step that makes most cancers incurable is metastasis. Understanding the traits that a cancer acquires to successfully grow and metastasize to distant sites gives insight into how tumors produce multiple factors that result in multiple different clinical syndromes that are lethal for the patient.","572":"A multitude of noninvasive, quantitative, functional imaging techniques are currently in use to study tumor physiology, to probe tumor molecular processes, and to study tumor molecules and metabolites in vitro and in vivo using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and optical imaging (OI). Such techniques can be used in conjunction with structural imaging techniques to detect, diagnose, characterize, or monitor tumors before and after therapeutic intervention. These can also be used to study tumor gene expression, to track cells and therapeutic drugs, to optimize individualized treatment planning for patients with tumors, and to foster new oncologic drug development. In this article, we review the rich variety of functional imaging techniques that are available for these purposes, which are becoming increasingly important for optimal individualized patient treatment in this day and age of \"personalized medicine.\"","573":"Many studies demonstrate that cancer incidence and mortality patterns among Asian Americans are heterogeneous, but national statistics on cancer for Asian ethnic groups are not routinely available. This article summarizes data on cancer incidence, mortality, risk factors, and screening for 5 of the largest Asian American ethnic groups in California. California has the largest Asian American population of any state and makes special efforts to collect health information for ethnic minority populations. We restricted our analysis to the 4 most common cancers (prostate, breast, lung, colon\/rectum) and for the 3 sites known to be more common in Asian Americans (stomach, liver, cervix). Cancer incidence and mortality were summarized for 5 Asian American ethnic groups in California in order of population size (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese). Chinese Americans had among the lowest incidence and death rate from all cancer combined; however, Chinese women had the highest lung cancer death rate. Filipinos had the highest incidence and death rate from prostate cancer and the highest death rate from female breast cancer. Vietnamese had among the highest incidence and death rates from liver, lung, and cervical cancer. Korean men and women had by far the highest incidence and mortality rates from stomach cancer. Japanese experienced the highest incidence and death rates from colorectal cancer and among the highest death rates from breast and prostate cancer. Variations in cancer risk factors were also observed and were for the most part consistent with variations in cancer incidence and mortality. Differences in cancer burden among Asian American ethnic groups should be considered in the clinical setting and in cancer control planning.","574":"Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common noncutaneous malignancy in the United States and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Approximately three quarters of patients are diagnosed with disease limited to the bowel wall or surrounding lymph nodes. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the treatment of localized colorectal cancer due to advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. For patients with Stage III colon cancer, an overall survival benefit for fluorouracil-based chemotherapy has been firmly established, and recent data have shown further efficacy through the inclusion of oxaliplatin into adjuvant treatment programs. For patients with Stage II colon cancer, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial, but may be appropriate in a subset of individuals at high risk for disease recurrence. In the treatment of patients with rectal cancer, improved outcomes have been noted with the use of total mesorectal excision and preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Current randomized clinical trials in the adjuvant therapy of colorectal cancer are examining the value of adding agents known to be active in metastatic disease, including those that modify specific molecular targets.","575":"Cancer risk perceptions are a key predictor of risk-reduction practices, health behaviors, and processing of cancer information. Nevertheless, patients and the general public (as well as health care providers) exhibit a number of errors and biases in the way they think about risk, such that their risk perceptions and decisions deviate greatly from those prescribed by normative decision models and by experts in risk assessment. For example, people are more likely to engage in screening behaviors such as mammography when faced with loss-based messages than gain-framed messages, and they often ignore the base rate of a given disease when assessing their own risk of obtaining this disease. In this article, we review many of the psychological processes that underlie risk perception and discuss how these processes lead to such deviations. Among these processes are difficulties with use of numerical information (innumeracy), cognitive processes (eg, use of time-saving heuristics), motivational factors (eg, loss and regret aversion), and emotion. We conclude with suggestions for future research in the area, as well as implications for improving the elicitation and communication of personal cancer risk.","576":"Minimal access approaches in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors of the stomach, large bowel, and genitourinary system are now being advocated in several surgical specialty areas. The laparoscope has evolved from a diagnostic tool to a modality that allows for removal of tumors using small incisions and the application of pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide. Through studies using animal models and patient investigation, the immunologic benefits of laparoscopic cancer procedures appear to be beneficial when compared with conventional laparotomy. Overall benefits of analgesic reduction, more rapid postoperative recovery, and patient satisfaction are the byproducts of minimal access approaches. Patients with cancers of the stomach, colon, and kidney show similar long-term outcomes when compared with conventional open techniques. Caution, however, should be exercised in recommending laparoscopic approaches for routine management of primary tumors of the rectum and adrenal gland.","577":"A better understanding of the molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has led to a dramatic paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with metastatic disease. Historically, a nonspecific immune approach using cytokines was employed, but recently this has transitioned to a molecularly-targeted approach against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and related pathways. Several anti-VEGF agents, including ligand-binding agents such as bevacizumab and the small molecule inhibitors of VEGF and related receptors such as sunitinib and sorafenib, have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with metastatic RCC. Other agents that inhibit alternative targets such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have also demonstrated activity. This generation of novel molecular targeted therapies continues to show great promise. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current management and to discuss potential future directions in the management of metastatic RCC.","578":"The remarkable success achieved in cervical cancer prevention is largely attributable to cervical cytology screening, also known as the Papanicolaou (Pap) test. The American Cancer Society (ACS) revised screening guidelines for Pap testing in 2002. The impact of these changes on future numbers of Pap tests has not been assessed. Using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data to determine historical screening patterns, we extrapolate the numbers of Pap tests that would be performed through 2010, under 5 different scenarios of implementation of screening guidelines. From 1993 to 2003, there was a steady increase in the number of Pap tests, with an estimated 65.6 million Pap tests performed in 2003. Approximately two thirds of women born after 1930 reported having been screened within the previous year, and 85% within the previous 3 years. Fifteen percent of Pap tests were performed in hysterectomized women, most of whom, according to current guidelines, should not be screened. Based on population projections, if screening behavior remains unchanged, 75 million Pap tests will be performed in 2010. Full compliance with ACS guidelines would approximately halve the total number of tests to 34 million. Potentially, with more appropriate allocation of resources according to guidelines, all women could be screened and the total number of Pap tests reduced, despite projected increases in the population.","579":"Each year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, including guideline updates, emerging issues that are relevant to screening for cancer, and a summary of the most current data on cancer screening rates for US adults. In 2006, there were no updates to ACS guidelines for early cancer detection. In this issue of the journal, we describe criteria for successful screening, discuss recent evidence and policy changes that have implications for cancer screening, summarize the ACS guidelines and describe guidelines reviews that are underway, and provide an update of the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).","580":"New evidence on breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) screening has become available since the American Cancer Society (ACS) last issued guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer in 2003. A guideline panel has reviewed this evidence and developed new recommendations for women at different defined levels of risk. Screening MRI is recommended for women with an approximately 20-25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer, including women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer and women who were treated for Hodgkin disease. There are several risk subgroups for which the available data are insufficient to recommend for or against screening, including women with a personal history of breast cancer, carcinoma in situ, atypical hyperplasia, and extremely dense breasts on mammography. Diagnostic uses of MRI were not considered to be within the scope of this review.","581":"","582":"Each year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data through 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are projected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all cancers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by 0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates among men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race\/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute number of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by more than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.","583":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) has published the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths in the current year for the United States that are commonly used by cancer control planners and the media. The methods used to produce these estimates have changed over the years as data (incidence) and statistical models improved. In this paper we present a new method that uses statistical models of cancer incidence that incorporate potential predictors of spatial and temporal variation of cancer occurrence and that account for delay in case reporting and then projects these estimated numbers of cases ahead 4 years using a piecewise linear (joinpoint) regression method. Based on evidence presented here that the new method produces more accurate estimates of the number of new cancer cases for years and areas for which data are available for comparison, the ACS has elected to use it to estimate the number of new cancer cases in Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2007 and in Cancer Statistics, 2007.","584":"","585":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) has developed guidelines for the use of the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for the prevention of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. These recommendations are based on a formal review of the available evidence. They address the use of prophylactic HPV vaccines, including who should be vaccinated and at what age, as well as a summary of policy and implementation issues. Implications for screening are also discussed.","586":"","587":"Staging of bone sarcomas is the process whereby patients are evaluated with regard to histology, as well as the local and distant extent, of disease. Bone sarcomas are staged based on grade, size, and the presence and location of metastases. The system is designed to help stratify patients according to known risk factors. Proper staging helps define the prognosis for patients and helps guide their treatment. Furthermore, staging allows meaningful comparisons to be done among groups of patients.","588":"The toxicity of antineoplastic drugs has been well known since they were introduced in the 1940s. Because most antineoplastic drugs are nonselective in their mechanism of action, they affect noncancerous as well as cancerous cells, resulting in well-documented side effects. During the 1970s, evidence came to light indicating health care workers may be at risk of harmful effects from antineoplastic drugs as a result of occupational exposure. Since that time, reports from several countries have documented drug contamination of the workplace, identified drugs in the urine of health care workers, and measured genotoxic responses in workers. Evidence also exists of teratogenic and adverse reproductive outcomes and increased cancers in health care workers. During the past 30 years, professional organizations and government agencies have developed guidelines to protect health care workers from adverse effects from occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs. Although many safety provisions were advanced to reduce worker exposure in the 1980s, recent studies have shown that workers continue to be exposed to these drugs despite safety policy improvements. In 2004, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published an alert reviewing the most recent information available and promoting a program of safe handling during their use.","589":"Cancer survivors are often highly motivated to seek information about food choices, physical activity, and dietary supplement use to improve their treatment outcomes, quality of life, and survival. To address these concerns, the American Cancer Society (ACS) convened a group of experts in nutrition, physical activity, and cancer to evaluate the scientific evidence and best clinical practices related to optimal nutrition and physical activity after the diagnosis of cancer. This report summarizes their findings and is intended to present health care providers with the best possible information from which to help cancer survivors and their families make informed choices related to nutrition and physical activity. The report discusses nutrition and physical activity issues during the phases of cancer treatment and recovery, living after recovery from treatment, and living with advanced cancer; select nutrition and physical activity issues such as body weight, food choices, and food safety; issues related to select cancer sites; and common questions about diet, physical activity, and cancer survivorship.","590":"","591":"","592":"","593":"","594":"","595":"Since the introduction of sentinel node biopsy in 1990 as a minimally invasive surgical technique for the diagnosis of melanoma lymphatic metastases, the number of applications has expanded. We review applications and the current status of sentinel node biopsy in melanoma, breast, colon, gastric, esophageal, head and neck, thyroid, and lung cancer. Variations on techniques specific to each organ are explained, and the current role of sentinel node biopsy in diagnosis and treatment is discussed.","596":"Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is an extremely heterogeneous group of rare tumors that share a putative mesenchymal cell origin. STS can occur in any soft tissue in the body, yet all share a common feature of primarily disseminating hematogenously, particularly to the lungs. Staging for STS is particularly useful in prognosis, design of effective multimodality treatment programs, and comparing treatment outcomes from different centers and different eras. The current iteration of AJCC STS staging includes Tumor, Grade, Node, and Metastasis with \"a\" indicating superficial and \"b\" indicating deep designations. Further opportunities to improve this process exist, particularly as molecular considerations become more apparent, and future evolution into an even more useful STS staging system can be anticipated.","597":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among Americans. These Guidelines, published every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The ACS Guidelines include recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or interferes with healthy behaviors. Community efforts are essential to create a social environment that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity. Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. This recommendation for community action recognizes that a supportive social environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. The ACS Guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services' 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.","598":"Immunotherapy of cancer has been explored for over a century, but it is only in the last decade that various antibody-based products have been introduced into the management of patients with diverse cancers. At present, this is one of the most active areas of clinical research, with eight therapeutic products already approved in oncology. Antibodies against tumor-associated markers have been a part of medical practice in immunohistology and in vitro immunoassays for several decades, have even been used as radioconjugates in diagnostic imaging, and are now becoming increasingly recognized as important biological agents for the detection and treatment of cancer. Molecular engineering has improved the prospects for such antibody-based therapeutics, resulting in different constructs and humanized\/human antibodies that can be administered frequently. Consequently, a renewed interest in the development of antibodies conjugated with radionuclides, drugs, and toxins has emerged. We review how antibodies and immunoconjugates have influenced cancer detection and therapy, and also describe promising new developments and challenges for broader applications.","599":"ABSTRACT diagnostic workup of familial colorectal cancer is an elaborate and time consuming process in which the family and several medical specialists closely collaborate. However, establishing a diagnosis can be very rewarding. If a mutation is detected in the family, a satisfactory explanation can be provided for an accumulation of tumors at young age, and often of untimely death. Appropriate presymptomatic testing can be offered to reduce mortality among at-risk family members, and relatives not at risk can avoid uncertainty and needlessly intensive surveillance. We show the differential diagnostic considerations when an individual with a family history of colorectal carcinoma is encountered, with emphasis on Lynch syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Carcinoma [HNPCC]). Practical recommendations for laboratory workup of suspected Lynch syndrome, including analysis of tumor tissue by microsatellite instability analysis and immunohistochemistry, and germline DNA analysis are given. Furthermore, the clinical management after a molecular diagnosis has been made is described. The diagnostic scheme presented here allows efficient and effective analysis of colorectal carcinoma cases with (suspected) Lynch syndrome, making optimal use of currently available technology.","600":"Much has been learned about childhood bereavement in the last few decades as studies have increasingly focused on the direct interviewing of children about their recovery from the tragic loss of a parent. It has been shown that children do indeed mourn, although differently from adults. Important moderating and mediating variables have been identified that impact their recovery from the loss of a parent, which can be the focus of intervention. When death is expected, the terminal phase of an illness has been found to be particularly stressful for children, yet seldom investigated. Similarly, few studies have explored the impact of development on children's experience and expression of grief. We present research findings that clarify phases in children's experience during the terminal illness, hospital visits, the death, and its immediate aftermath, as well as how the parent is mourned and issues in longer term reconstitution. Variations in children's responses in these phases are described as they were experienced by 87 children from 3 different developmental groupings: 3 to 5 years, 6 to 8 years, and 9 to 11 years. Recommendations are suggested for parents and professionals about ways to understand and support children during the terminal illness, at the time of death, and during the phase of reconstitution.","601":"In this article, the American Cancer Society (ACS) provides estimates of new breast cancer cases and deaths in 2006 and describes trends in incidence, mortality, and survival for female breast cancer in the United States. These estimates are based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, which includes state data from NCI and the National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics for the most recent years available (1975 to 2002). This article also shows trends in screening mammography. Approximately 212,920 new cases of invasive breast cancer, 61,980 in situ cases, and 40,970 deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2006. As previously reported, breast cancer incidence rates increased rapidly among women of all races from 1980 to 1987, a period when there was increasing uptake of mammography by a growing proportion of US women, and then continued to increase, but at a much slower rate, from 1987 to 2002. Trends in incidence vary by age, race, socioeconomic status, and stage. The continuing increase in incidence (all stages combined) is limited to White women age 50 and older; recent trends are stable for African American women age 50 and older and White women under age 50 years and are decreasing for African American women under age 50 years. Although incidence rates (all races combined) are substantially higher for women age 50 and older (375.0 per 100,000 females) compared with women younger than 50 years (42.5 per 100,000 females), approximately 23% of breast cancers are diagnosed in women younger than 50 years because those women represent 73% of the female population. For women age 35 and younger, age-specific incidence rates are slightly higher among African Americans compared with Whites but then cross over so that Whites have substantially higher incidence at all later ages. Among women of all races and ages, breast cancer mortality rates declined at an average rate of 2.3% per year between 1990 and 2002, a trend that reflects progress in both early detection and treatment. However, death rates in African American women remain 37% higher than in Whites, despite lower incidence rates. Although, in national surveys, approximately 70% of women age 40 years and older report having had a mammogram in the past 2 years, rates vary by race\/ethnicity and are markedly lower among women with lower levels of education, without health insurance, and in recent immigrants. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the true percentage of women having regular mammography is lower than reported in survey data. Encouraging patients age 40 years and older to have annual mammography and clinical breast exam is the single most important step that clinicians can take to reduce suffering and death from breast cancer. Clinicians should also ensure that patients at high risk of breast cancer are identified and offered appropriate referrals and treatment. Continued progress in the control of breast cancer will require sustained and increased efforts to provide high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment to all segments of the population.","602":"Patients with resected colorectal cancer are at risk for recurrent cancer and metachronous neoplasms in the colon. This joint update of guidelines by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer addresses only the use of endoscopy in the surveillance of these patients. Patients with endoscopically resected Stage I colorectal cancer, surgically resected Stage II and III cancers, and Stage IV cancer resected for cure (isolated hepatic or pulmonary metastasis) are candidates for endoscopic surveillance. The colorectum should be carefully cleared of synchronous neoplasia in the perioperative period. In nonobstructed colons, colonoscopy should be performed preoperatively. In obstructed colons, double contrast barium enema or computed tomography colonography should be done preoperatively, and colonoscopy should be performed 3 to 6 months after surgery. These steps complete the process of clearing synchronous disease. After clearing for synchronous disease, another colonoscopy should be performed in 1 year to look for metachronous lesions. This recommendation is based on reports of a high incidence of apparently metachronous second cancers in the first 2 years after resection. If the examination at 1 year is normal, then the interval before the next subsequent examination should be 3 years. If that colonoscopy is normal, then the interval before the next subsequent examination should be 5 years. Shorter intervals may be indicated by associated adenoma findings (see Postpolypectomy Surveillance Guideline). Shorter intervals are also indicated if the patient's age, family history, or tumor testing indicate definite or probable hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Patients undergoing low anterior resection of rectal cancer generally have higher rates of local cancer recurrence, compared with those with colon cancer. Although effectiveness is not proven, performance of endoscopic ultrasound or flexible sigmoidoscopy at 3- to 6-month intervals for the first 2 years after resection can be considered for the purpose of detecting a surgically curable recurrence of the original rectal cancer.","603":"Adenomatous polyps are the most common neoplastic findings uncovered in people who undergo colorectal screening or have a diagnostic workup for symptoms. It was common practice in the 1970s for these patients to have annual follow-up surveillance examinations to detect additional new adenomas as well as missed synchronous adenomas. As a result of the National Polyp Study report in 1993, which demonstrated clearly in a randomized design that the first postpolypectomy examination could be deferred for 3 years, guidelines published by a gastrointestinal consortium in 1997 recommended that the first follow-up surveillance be 3 years after polypectomy for most patients. In 2003, these guidelines were updated, colonoscopy was recommended as the only follow-up examination, and stratification at baseline into lower and higher risk for subsequent adenomas was suggested. The 1997 and 2003 guidelines dealt with both screening and surveillance. However, it has become increasingly clear that postpolypectomy surveillance is now a large part of endoscopic practice, draining resources from screening and diagnosis. In addition, surveys have demonstrated that a large proportion of endoscopists are conducting surveillance examinations at shorter intervals than recommended in the guidelines. In the present paper, a careful analytic approach was designed addressing all evidence available in the literature to delineate predictors of advanced pathology, both cancer and advanced adenomas, so that patients can be more definitely stratified at their baseline colonoscopy into those at lower or increased risk for a subsequent advanced neoplasia. People at increased risk have either three or more adenomas, or high-grade dysplasia, or villous features, or an adenoma &gt; or =1 cm in size. It is recommended that they have a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy. People at lower risk who have one or two small (&lt; 1 cm) tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up in 5 to 10 years, whereas people with hyperplastic polyps only should have a 10-year follow-up as average-risk people. Recent papers have reported a significant number of missed cancers by colonoscopy. However, high-quality baseline colonoscopy with excellent patient preparation and adequate withdrawal time should minimize this and reduce clinicians' concerns. These guidelines were developed jointly by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society to provide a broader consensus and thereby increase utilization of the recommendations by endoscopists. Adoption of these guidelines nationally can have a dramatic impact on shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening. It has been shown that the first screening colonoscopy and polypectomy produces the greatest effects on reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with adenomatous polyps.","604":"Much progress has been made in reducing tobacco use in the United States. Despite the continuing challenges of tobacco control and the massive burden of illness, death, and economic costs caused by tobacco products, there are now unprecedented opportunities to prevent and treat tobacco dependence through a combination of interventions that have proven effective at both the population and individual levels. This report briefly reviews population trends in tobacco use by youth and adults, describes some of the policy measures that have proven effective in comprehensive tobacco control, and discusses the role of clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of tobacco dependence in patients.","605":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,399,790 new cancer cases and 564,830 deaths from cancer are expected in the United States in 2006. When deaths are aggregated by age, cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death for those younger than age 85 since 1999. Delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates stabilized in men from 1995 through 2002, but continued to increase by 0.3% per year from 1987 through 2002 in women. Between 2002 and 2003, the actual number of recorded cancer deaths decreased by 778 in men, but increased by 409 in women, resulting in a net decrease of 369, the first decrease in the total number of cancer deaths since national mortality record keeping was instituted in 1930. The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease for the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and for breast and colon and rectum cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women continues to increase slightly. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40% and 18% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.","606":"Palliative care practitioners are now better able than ever before to ameliorate end-of-life symptom distress. What remains less developed, however, is the knowledge base and skill set necessary to recognize, assess, and compassionately address the psychosocial, existential, and spiritual aspects of the patient's dying experience. This review provides an overview of these areas, focusing primarily on empirical data that has examined these issues. A brief overview of psychiatric challenges in end-of-life care is complemented with a list of resources for readers wishing to explore this area more extensively. The experience of spiritual or existential suffering toward the end of life is explored, with an examination of the conceptual correlates of suffering. These correlates include: hopelessness, burden to others, loss of sense of dignity, and desire for death or loss of will to live. An empirically-derived model of dignity is described in some detail, with practical examples of diagnostic questions and therapeutic interventions to preserve dignity. Other interventions to reduce existential or spiritual suffering are described and evidence of their efficacy is presented. The author concludes that palliative care must continue to develop compassionate, individually tailored, and effective responses to the mounting vulnerability and increasingly difficult physical, psychosocial, and spiritual challenges facing persons nearing the end of life.","607":"A causal link between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis is explored by reviewing illustrative examples of specific cancers and causal agents and mechanisms. The causal agents or pathologic conditions include microbial agents, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and specific agents that cause chronic obstructive or diffuse interstitial lung disease. The proportion of total cancer deaths attributable to infectious agents is estimated to be about 20% to 25% in developing countries and 7% to 10% in more industrialized countries. Recurrent or persistent inflammation may induce, promote, or influence susceptibility to carcinogenesis by causing DNA damage, inciting tissue reparative proliferation, and\/or creating a stromal \"soil\" that is enriched with cytokines and growth factors. Future research on the complex cascade of cellular and humoral factors participating in the chronic inflammatory process will further understanding of the pathogenesis of various cancers and potentially provide a rationale for targeted chemopreventive interventions.","608":"The sixth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual contains some of the most extensive and significant revisions that have ever been made in the breast cancer staging system. The principal changes are related to the size, number, location, and method of detection of regional metastases to the lymph nodes. Some changes are related to the growing use of new technology (eg, sentinel lymph node biopsy, immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), whereas others are amendments of prior staging criteria, reflecting recent clinical evidence or widespread clinical consensus. Available data did not support the addition of new prognostic indicators such as histologic tumor grade to the tumor-node-metastasis system at this time. Future developments in determining breast cancer prognosis will most likely incorporate new approaches to identifying the genetic fingerprint of individual tumors.","609":"Information technology is rapidly advancing and making its way into many primary care settings. The technology may provide the means to increase the delivery of cancer preventive services. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the literature on information technology impacts on the delivery of cancer preventive services in primary care offices. Thirty studies met our selection criteria. Technology interventions studied to date have been limited to some type of reminder to either patients or providers. Patient reminders have been mailed before appointments, mailed unrelated to an appointment, mailed after a missed appointment, or given at the time of an appointment. Telephone call interventions have not used technology to automate the calls. Provider interventions have been primarily computer-generated reminders at the time of an appointment. However, there has been limited use of computer-generated audits, feedback, or report cards. The effectiveness of information technology on increasing cancer screening was modest at best. The full potential of information technology to unload the provider-patient face-to-face encounter has not been examined. There is critical need to study these new technologic approaches to understand the impact and acceptance by providers and patients.","610":"Each January, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, including guideline updates, emerging issues that are relevant to screening for cancer, and a summary of the most current data on cancer screening rates for US adults. In 2005, there were no updates to ACS guidelines. In this issue of the journal, we summarize the guidelines, discuss recent evidence and policy changes that have implications for cancer screening, and provide an update of the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening by age, sex, and insurance status from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.","611":"","612":"Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas are always treatable and frequently curable malignancies. However, choosing the most appropriate therapy requires accurate diagnosis and a careful staging evaluation. New patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma should have their tumors classified using the World Health Organization classification. The specific choice of therapy is dependent on a careful staging evaluation. Patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma are assigned an anatomic stage using the Ann Arbor system. However, patients should also be classified using the International Prognostic Index. New insights into the biology of the lymphomas in the coming years might well improve our ability to evaluate patients and choose therapy.","613":"The role of combined-modality therapy for pancreatic cancer is evolving with the recent development and completion of major, multi-institutional clinical trials. One of the challenges for the busy clinician is to appreciate the variation in staging, surgical expertise, and application of either definitive chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for local and\/or regionally advanced disease. Our aim is to summarize the current state-of-the-art management and future directions regarding the multimodality approach to pancreatic cancer.","614":"For decades, the incidence rates for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach have been declining while the rates for adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia have increased profoundly. Recent studies have shown that the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is regularly exposed to concentrated gastric acid and to a variety of nitrosating species, noxious agents that may contribute to carcinogenesis in this region. For adenocarcinomas that straddle the GEJ, it can be difficult to determine whether the tumor originated in the esophagus or in the gastric cardia. This classification problem hampers studies on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of GEJ tumors. Current concepts in the prevention of cancers of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach have emerged from advances in our understanding of the specific molecular events that occur during the evolution of these tumors. This report reviews those events and focuses on current concepts in the prevention of adenocarcinomas at the GEJ. The similarities and differences in risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, and in preventive strategies for adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia are highlighted.","615":"Many patients being treated for cancer use dietary supplements, particularly antioxidants, in the hope of reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Some researchers have claimed, furthermore, that antioxidants also increase the effectiveness of cytotoxic therapy and have explicitly recommended their use. However, mechanistic considerations suggest that antioxidants might reduce the effects of conventional cytotoxic therapies. Preclinical data are currently inconclusive and a limited number of clinical studies have not found any benefit. Clinicians should advise their patients against the use of antioxidant dietary supplements during chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Such caution should be seen as the standard approach for any unproven agent that may be harmful.","616":"Prostate cancer continues to be the most common lethal malignancy diagnosed in American men and the second leading cause of male cancer mortality. Over 60 years ago, Huggins and Hodges discovered androgen deprivation as a first-line therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, which leads to remissions typically lasting 2 to 3 years, but in most men prostate cancer ultimately progresses to an androgen-independent state resulting in death due to widespread metastases. Multiple mechanisms of androgen independence have now been documented, including amplification of the androgen receptor as well as signal transduction pathways that bypass the androgen receptor completely. In 2004, two landmark studies demonstrated a survival advantage in androgen-independent prostate cancer patients utilizing docetaxel chemotherapy, setting a new standard of care for this disease. In addition, treatments with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid and systemic radioisotopes have also been shown to have palliative benefits in this population. Building on these advances, several new traditional chemotherapeutic agents as well as new targeted therapies are under development.","617":"Approximately 50% of long-term cigarette smokers die prematurely from the adverse effects of smoking, including on cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or other illness. This risk can be substantially reduced by smoking cessation, with greater benefits occurring the earlier in the smoking career that cessation occurs. However, cessation provides benefits at any stage, including after the onset of smoking-related disease, by improving the prognosis and quality of life. Clinicians can have a significant impact on reducing tobacco use by their patients by following the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines. Proven strategies include structured methods of advising cigarette smokers to quit and guidance to facilitate their efforts, as well as the use of various pharmacotherapies. Pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence include nicotine replacement medications in the form of gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, sublingual tablet, nasal spray, and vapor inhaler formulations. The only nonnicotine medication that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is bupropion. Combination therapies, long-term medication therapies, and harm reduction strategies may further improve outcome with approved medications. Further, new medications such as varenicline and rimonabant are likely to reach tobacco users who are refractory to current treatments. Increasing the treatment options, increasing availability, and reducing the perceived cost of these medications may have an additional public health impact.","618":"Before the 1970s, a substantial percentage of cancer survivors faced blatant employment discrimination with little legal recourse, a paucity of support services, and limited medical options for curative treatment. Since then, survivors have benefited from improvements in cancer treatment, the passage of state and federal antidiscrimination laws, and a sea change in perceptions about living with and beyond cancer. Consequently, cancer survivors now face fewer barriers to employment opportunities. Because millions of cancer survivors, more than ever before, are now working age adults, advocacy efforts should shift from expanding legal protection from cancer-based discrimination to providing resources to help survivors meet their individual employment-related concerns.","619":"The sixth edition of the tumor-node-metastasis staging system for head and neck cancers incorporates some significant shifts in philosophy. As treatment paradigms shift and data from ongoing clinical and basic research become available, further revisions may be expected in the future. The purpose of this review is to highlight the complexities involved in developing a user-friendly staging system and to report the major changes in the new version. The authors also discuss some areas of current interest that may have the potential to lead to future modifications.","620":"Human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients are at an increased risk for developing both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with the general population. With the remarkable decrease in the incidence of opportunistic infections since the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related lymphoma (ARL) is now the second most common cancer associated with human immunodeficiency virus after Kaposi sarcoma. Over the last few years, advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of this heterogeneous group of lymphomas have led to the adoption of new classification systems. The prognosis of patients with ARL has improved dramatically with the availability of HAART, and the survival of many of these patients is now comparable to patients in the general population. Apart from the contribution of HAART, this improvement in prognosis can also be attributed to new initiatives in treatment of these patients, such as the use of effective infusional regimens, the feasibility of high-dose therapy with peripheral stem cell rescue for relapsed or refractory disease, and better supportive care. Nonetheless, several controversial issues persist, including the optimal timing of HAART with combination chemotherapy, the role of rituximab when incorporated into treatment regimens, and the optimal therapy for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Burkitt lymphoma. This article reviews the changes in the epidemiology of ARL in the era of HAART, advances in the biology of ARL, new developments in the management of patients with ARL, and several of the controversial issues that oncologists may encounter in the care of these patients.","621":"In this review, the reproductive impact of treatments for several common cancers and options to maintain fertility in women and men undergoing treatment for these cancers will be discussed. The options available to any particular cancer survivor will depend on her or his age at the time of diagnosis and treatment, cancer type and primary site, stage, and type of treatment.","622":"","623":"Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a mechanism by which cells undergo death to control cell proliferation or in response to DNA damage. The understanding of apoptosis has provided the basis for novel targeted therapies that can induce death in cancer cells or sensitize them to established cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. These novel agents include those targeting the extrinsic pathway such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1, and those targeting the intrinsic Bcl-2 family pathway such as antisense bcl-2 oligonucleotides. Many pathways and proteins control the apoptosis machinery. Examples include p53, the nuclear factor kappa B, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway, and the ubiquitin\/proteosome pathway. These can be targeted by specific modulators such as bortezomib, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as CCI-779 and RAD 001. Because these pathways may be preferentially altered in tumor cells, there is potential for a selective effect in tumors sparing normal tissue. This article reviews the current understanding of the apoptotic pathways, including the extrinsic (cytoplasmic) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways, and the agents being developed to target these pathways.","624":"Effective communication skills enable physicians to improve patients' understanding of their illnesses, improve patient adherence to treatment regimens, use time efficiently, avoid burnout, and increase professional fulfillment. Common communication pitfalls include blocking, lecturing, depending on a routine, collusion, and premature reassurance. Fundamental communication skills include \"ask-tell-ask,\" \"tell me more,\" and responding empathetically. Key communication tasks that are linked to the illness trajectory include: the first visit, giving bad news, making anticancer treatment decisions, offering clinical trials, completing anticancer therapy, and discontinuing palliative chemotherapy. While enhancing or acquiring new skills ultimately requires practice and feedback over time, this article provides a cognitive map for important communication skills that physicians need over the course of caring for a person with cancer.","625":"Endocrine therapy of hormone receptor-positive breast tumors is widely used as palliative therapy for metastatic breast cancer and as adjuvant therapy for early stage breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been the definitive standard of hormonal therapies for the last 30 years because of its documented efficacy and reasonable safety profile. Based on encouraging results from trials utilizing the selective, third generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in metastatic breast cancer, a number of trials were designed to examine these agents as adjuvant therapies. Trials directly comparing AIs with tamoxifen have, to date, demonstrated superior disease-free-survival with AIs. Likewise, trials examining the use of AIs after tamoxifen have demonstrated better outcomes compared with tamoxifen alone. Additionally, letrozole has been demonstrated to result in superior disease-free-survival after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, compared with no further therapy. In general, the AIs are tolerated at least as well as tamoxifen but decrease bone mineral density and increase osteoporosis due to their lack of estrogenic effects on bone. Based on the fact that AIs appear more effective at preventing contralateral breast cancers than tamoxifen, they are being examined as breast cancer preventives. Despite available data using the AIs as adjuvant therapies, many questions remain unanswered, and further trials will be needed to address these important issues.","626":"","627":"Modern advances in computers have fueled parallel advances in imaging technologies. The improvements in imaging have in turn allowed a higher level of complexity to be incorporated into radiotherapy treatment planning systems. As a result of these changes, the delivery of radiotherapy evolved from therapy designed based primarily on plain (two dimensional) x-ray images and hand calculations to three-dimensional x-ray based images incorporating increasingly complex computer algorithms. More recently, biologic variables based on differences between tumor metabolism, tumor antigens, and normal tissues have been incorporated into the treatment process. In addition, greater awareness of the challenges to the accuracy of the treatment planning process, such as problems with set-error and organ movement, have begun to be systematically addressed, ushering in an era of so-called Four-Dimensional Radiotherapy. This review article discusses how these advances have changed the way the most common neoplasms are treated now and will be treated in the near future.","628":"Many people with cancer experience pain, anxiety, and mood disturbance. Conventional treatments do not always satisfactorily relieve these symptoms, and some patients may not be able to tolerate their side effects. Complementary therapies such as acupuncture, mind-body techniques, massage, and other methods can help relieve symptoms and improve physical and mental well-being. Self-hypnosis and relaxation techniques help reduce procedural pain. Acupuncture is well documented to relieve chronic cancer pain. Massage and meditation improve anxiety and other symptoms of distress. Many dietary supplements contain biologically active constituents with effects on mood. However, not all complementary therapies are appropriate or useful, and even helpful complementary modalities may not be optimal under some circumstances. Situations when precaution is indicated include acute onset of symptoms and severe symptoms, which require immediate mainstream intervention. Dietary supplements are associated with serious negative consequences under some circumstances. The authors summarize the research on these modalities and discuss the rationale, expectation, and necessary precautions involved with combining complementary therapies and mainstream care. Practical clinical issues are addressed.","629":"Estimates of the worldwide incidence, mortality and prevalence of 26 cancers in the year 2002 are now available in the GLOBOCAN series of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The results are presented here in summary form, including the geographic variation between 20 large \"areas\" of the world. Overall, there were 10.9 million new cases, 6.7 million deaths, and 24.6 million persons alive with cancer (within three years of diagnosis). The most commonly diagnosed cancers are lung (1.35 million), breast (1.15 million), and colorectal (1 million); the most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.18 million deaths), stomach cancer (700,000 deaths), and liver cancer (598,000 deaths). The most prevalent cancer in the world is breast cancer (4.4 million survivors up to 5 years following diagnosis). There are striking variations in the risk of different cancers by geographic area. Most of the international variation is due to exposure to known or suspected risk factors related to lifestyle or environment, and provides a clear challenge to prevention.","630":"Epidemiology is very successful in identifying environmental and lifestyle factors that increase or reduce risk of specific cancers, leading to cancer prevention strategies. However, the etiology of many types of cancer is still poorly understood, despite extensive use of questionnaires and interview-based approaches in conventional epidemiologic studies. The integration of molecular techniques into epidemiology studies may provide new insights and has been referred to as molecular epidemiology. For instance, our ability to make connections between lifestyle and cancer risk is limited by difficulty in accurately measuring exposure to many carcinogens-newer molecular markers of exposure may provide better information. The completion of the Human Genome Project gives us knowledge of the genetic variations that presumably underlie the fact that a family history of cancer is a risk factor for most cancer types. Some of this excess risk has been explained over the last decade by identification of mutations in genes that give rise to a very high familial risk. Molecular epidemiologists are searching for genes that may give rise to much smaller increases in individual risk, but account for much of the residual risk associated with family history. These genes may also interact with environment and lifestyle factors such that cancer risk is not equally elevated in all persons exposed to an environmental factor (but not genetically susceptible), or all gene carriers (but not exposed to the environmental factor). Molecular markers may help to differentiate tumors with the same histologic appearance into different etiologic subtypes. Finally, response to treatment may be determined by molecular subtypes of the tumor, or inherited variation in drug metabolism. Examples will be given of how use of molecular techniques is informative in epidemiological studies of cancer and is predicted to lead to improvements in cancer incidence, early detection, and mortality.","631":"Each January, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, including guideline updates, emerging issues that are relevant to screening for cancer, and a summary of the most current data on cancer screening rates for US adults. In 2004, there were no updates to ACS guidelines. In this article, we summarize the current guidelines, discuss recent evidence and policy changes that have implications for cancer screening, and provide an update of the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening by age, gender, and insurance status from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.","632":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,372,910 new cancer cases and 570,280 deaths are expected in the United States in 2005. When deaths are aggregated by age, cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death for persons younger than 85 since 1999. When adjusted to delayed reporting, cancer incidence rates stabilized in men from 1995 through 2001 but continued to increase by 0.3% per year from 1987 through 2001 in women. The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease from the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and from breast and colorectal cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women has leveled off after increasing for many decades. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40% and 20% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.","633":"","634":"","635":"Clinical breast examination (CBE) seeks to detect breast abnormalities or evaluate patient reports of symptoms to find palpable breast cancers at an earlier stage of progression, when treatment is more effective and treatment options are greater than for later stage disease. Evidence suggests that, for some women, CBE can be an important complement to mammography in the earlier detection of breast cancer; CBE identifies some cancers missed by mammography and provides an important screening tool among women for whom mammography is not recommended or women who do not receive high-quality screening mammography according to recommended guidelines. But CBE performance and reporting approaches are inconsistent. Health care providers indicate that they are not confident in their CBE skills and would welcome training. Studies demonstrate that training can enhance CBE performance, measured in terms of execution of CBE components and accuracy. This literature review provides evidence to the extent that it is available, to support the specific recommendations of Saslow, et al. for optimizing CBE performance and reporting and to guide further research on CBE performance characteristics, reporting systems, barriers to high-quality CBE performance, and training.","636":"Clinical breast examination (CBE) seeks to detect breast abnormalities or evaluate patient reports of symptoms to find palpable breast cancers at an earlier stage of progression. Treatment options for earlier-stage cancers are generally more numerous, include less toxic alternatives, and are usually more effective than treatments for later-stage cancers. For average-risk women aged 40 and younger, earlier detection of palpable tumors identified by CBE can lead to earlier therapy. After age 40, when mammography is recommended, CBE is regarded as an adjunct to mammography. Recent debate, however, has questioned the contributions of CBE to the detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic women and particularly to improved survival and reduced mortality rates. Clinicians remain widely divided about the level of evidence supporting CBE and their confidence in the examination. Yet, CBE is practiced extensively in the United States and continues to be recommended by many leading health organizations. It is in this context that this report provides a brief review of evidence for CBE's role in the earlier detection of breast cancer, highlights current practice issues, and presents recommendations that, when implemented, could contribute to greater standardization of the practice and reporting of CBE. These recommendations may also lead to improved evidence of the nature and extent of CBE's contribution to the earlier detection of breast cancer.","637":"Hereditary cancer syndromes account for an estimated 5% of breast, ovarian, and colon cancers. The rapid discovery of cancer-related genes in the last 15 years has propelled the field of cancer genetic risk assessment forward. With patients becoming increasingly aware of available genetic testing options, it is important that various health professionals become knowledgeable in identifying and advising patients at increased risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome. This article will outline the components of providing a hereditary cancer risk assessment with a focus on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and hereditary colon cancer.","638":"Stage is the strongest predictor of survival for patients with colorectal cancer. Accurate staging also is critical for appropriate patient management and meaningful clinical research. Uniform staging criteria applied in a uniform manner are essential for accurate evaluation of therapies and outcomes. Historically, numerous different staging systems for colorectal cancer have been employed, but a single internationally recognized system is required to ensure a common language for cancer that is understood by clinicians in all specialties. For the tumor, node, metastasis system to remain relevant, it has to continuously undergo critical evaluation and change when clinically indicated.","639":"","640":"Each year, state and local health departments respond to more than 1,000 inquiries about suspected cancer clusters. Three quarters of these reports involve situations that are clearly not clusters and can be resolved by telephone. For the remainder, follow-up is needed, first to confirm the number of persons affected, their age, type of cancer, dates of diagnosis, and other factors, and then to compare cancer incidence in the affected population with background rates in state tumor registries. In approximately 5% to 15% of the reported situations, formal statistical testing confirms that the number of observed cases exceeds the number expected in a specific area, given the age, sex, and size of the affected population. Even in these instances, however, chance remains a plausible explanation for many clusters, and further epidemiologic investigation almost never identifies the underlying cause of disease with confidence. The few exceptions have involved clusters of extremely rare cancers occurring in well-defined occupational or medical settings, generally involving intense and sustained exposure to an unusual chemical, occupation, infection, or drug. This article discusses the resources and scientific tools currently available to investigate cancer clusters. It also provides a framework for understanding cancer clusters and a realistic appraisal of what cluster investigations can and cannot provide in the context of community expectations.","641":"The lymphomas are a diverse group of malignant disorders that vary with respect to their molecular features, genetics, clinical presentation, treatment approaches, and outcome. Over the past few years, there have been major advances in our understanding of the biology of these diseases, leading to a universally adopted World Health Organization classification system. New therapies are now available with the potential to improve patient outcome, and the International Prognostic Index and standardized response criteria help make clinical trials interpretable. Most notably, the chimeric antiCD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has altered our therapeutic paradigms for B-cell disorders. Combinations of this antibody with chemotherapy and other biologic agents have shown promise in treating lymphoma. Other antibodies, radioimmunoconjugates (such as Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and I-131 tositumomab), and oblimerson sodium (a BCL-2 antisense oligonucleotide) have all shown promise. New chemotherapy regimens such as bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP), agents such as gemcitabine, and monoclonal antibodies directed against CD30 are also being studied in Hodgkin Lymphoma. The challenge of clinical research is to optimize the use of these agents, select patients most likely to respond, and develop multitargeted strategies based on sound scientific rational, with the potential to increase the cure rate of patients with lymphomas.","642":"The potential for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in cervical cancer prevention programs has been a topic at the forefront of cervical cancer policy discussions in recent years. To prevent some of the anxiety and psychological distress often experienced on HPV diagnosis and during the period of management, mass patient education must accompany the incorporation of HPV DNA testing into screening protocols. To contribute to a growing body of work that provides an empiric basis for development of effective counseling messages about HPV and HPV testing, this paper highlights women's most common information gaps and psychosocial concerns and describes the different perspectives offered by women's usual sources of information about HPV, including the crucial role of the clinical community in creating a shared decision making environment in which screening decisions and results can be discussed.","643":"","644":"Survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer are one of the higher risk populations seen by health care professionals. The curative therapy administered for the cancer also affects growing and developing tissues. Following chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, many survivors will experience chronic or late-occurring health problems, often not becoming clinically apparent until decades after therapy. Survivors face an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and diminished quality of life associated with their previous cancer therapy. Risk is further modified by the survivor's genetics, lifestyle habits, and comorbid health conditions. Over their lifetime, survivors will see health care professionals from an array of specialties and disciplines. The aim of this review is threefold: (1) to convey a sense of the risk faced by survivors to clinicians unfamiliar with the population; (2) to provide an up-to-date tool for clinicians, regardless of specialty or discipline, when providing care for a survivor; and (3) to complement the recently completed recommendations for screening, prevention, and management of childhood cancer survivors.","645":"Collectively, cardiovascular disease (including stroke), cancer, and diabetes account for approximately two-thirds of all deaths in the United States and about 700 billion US dollars in direct and indirect economic costs each year. Current approaches to health promotion and prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes do not approach the potential of the existing state of knowledge. A concerted effort to increase application of public health and clinical interventions of known efficacy to reduce prevalence of tobacco use, poor diet, and insufficient physical activity-the major risk factors for these diseases-and to increase utilization of screening tests for their early detection could substantially reduce the human and economic cost of these diseases. In this article, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the American Heart Association review strategies for the prevention and early detection of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, as the beginning of a new collaboration among the three organizations. The goal of this joint venture is to stimulate substantial improvements in primary prevention and early detection through collaboration between key organizations, greater public awareness about healthy lifestyles, legislative action that results in more funding for and access to primary prevention programs and research, and reconsideration of the concept of the periodic medical checkup as an effective platform for prevention, early detection, and treatment.","646":"","647":"","648":"Each day, more than 12.5 million health-related computer searches are conducted on the World Wide Web. Based on a meta-analysis of 24 published surveys, the author estimates that in the developed world, about 39% of persons with cancer are using the Internet, and approximately 2.3 million persons living with cancer worldwide are online. In addition, 15% to 20% of persons with cancer use the Internet \"indirectly\" through family and friends. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, the available evidence on how persons with cancer are using the Internet and the effect of Internet use on persons with cancer is summarized. The author distinguishes four areas of Internet use: communication (electronic mail), community (virtual support groups), content (health information on the World Wide Web), and e-commerce. A conceptual framework summarizing the factors involved in a possible link between Internet use and cancer outcomes is presented, and future areas for research are highlighted.","649":"In this article, the American Cancer Society (ACS) describes trends in incidence, mortality, and survival rates of female breast cancer in the United States by race and ethnicity. It also provides estimates of new cases and deaths and shows trends in screening mammography. The incidence and survival data derive from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; mortality data are from the National Center for Health Statistics. Approximately 211,300 new cases of invasive breast cancer, 55,700 in situ cases, and 39,800 deaths are expected to occur among women in the United States in 2003. Breast cancer incidence rates have increased among women of all races combined and white women since the early 1980s. The increasing rate in white women predominantly involves small (&lt; or = 2 cm) and localized-stage tumors, although a small increase in the incidence of regional-stage tumors and those larger than five cm occurred since the early 1990s. The incidence rate among African American women stabilized during the 1990s for all breast cancers and for localized tumors. African American women are more likely than white women to be diagnosed with large tumors and distant-stage disease. Other racial and ethnic groups have lower incidence rates than do either white or African American women. However, the proportion of disease diagnosed at advanced stage and with larger tumor size in all minorities is greater than in white persons. Death rates decreased by 2.5% per year among white women since 1990 and by 1% per year among African American women since 1991. The disparity in mortality rates between white and African American women increased progressively between 1980 and 2000, so that by 2000 the age-standardized death rate was 32% higher in African Americans. Clinicians should be aware that 63% and 29% of breast cancers are diagnosed at local- and regional-stage disease, for which the five-year relative survival rates are 97% and 79%, respectively. This information, coupled with decreasing mortality rates and improvements in treatment, may motivate women to have regular mammographic and clinical breast examinations. Continued efforts are needed to increase the availability of high-quality mammography and treatment to all segments of the population.","650":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. At the time of diagnosis, most patients are older than 65 years and have Stage III or IV disease. More than 80% of patients have non-small cell lung cancer and the rest have small cell lung cancer. Age is not a significant prognostic factor for overall survival and response to treatment for patients with either type of lung cancer. Treatment options should be tailored to older patients based on the same selection process and benefits seen in the population as a whole. This article reviews the available data regarding surgery, radiation, and systemic treatment for older patients with lung cancer and considers the role of geriatric assessment in the evaluation of older patients.","651":"","652":"Cancer chemoprevention is defined as the use of natural, synthetic, or biologic chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent carcinogenic progression to invasive cancer. The success of several recent clinical trials in preventing cancer in high-risk populations suggests that chemoprevention is a rational and appealing strategy. This review will highlight current clinical research in chemoprevention, the biologic effects of chemopreventive agents on epithelial carcinogenesis, and the usefulness of intermediate biomarkers as markers of premalignancy. Selected chemoprevention trials are discussed with a focus on strategies of trial design and clinical outcome. Future directions in the field of chemoprevention will be proposed that are based on recently acquired mechanistic insight into carcinogenesis.","653":"A completely revised staging system for cutaneous melanoma was implemented in 2003. The changes were validated with a prognostic factors analysis involving 17,600 melanoma patients from prospective databases. This major collaborative study of predicting melanoma outcome was conducted specifically for this project, and the results were used to finalize the criteria for this evidence-based staging system. In fact, this was the largest prognostic factors analysis of prospectively followed melanoma patients ever conducted. Important results that shaped the staging criteria involved both the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) criteria and stage grouping for all four stages of melanoma. Major changes in the staging include: (1) melanoma thickness and ulceration are the dominant predictors of survival in patients with localized melanoma (Stages I and II); deeper level of invasion (ie, IV and V) was independently associated with reduced survival only in patients with thin or T1 melanomas. (2) The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the tumor burden were the most dominant predictors of survival in patients with Stage III melanoma; patients with metastatic nodes detected by palpation had a shorter survival compared with patients whose nodal metastases were first detected by sentinel node excision of clinically occult or \"microscopic\" metastases. (3) The site of distant metastases (nonvisceral versus lung versus all other visceral metastatic sites) and the presence of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were the dominant predictors of outcome in patients with Stage IV or distant metastases. (4) An upstaging was implemented for all patients with Stage I, II, and III disease when a primary melanoma is ulcerated by histopathological criteria. (5) Satellite metastases around a primary melanoma and in-transit metastases were merged into a single staging entity that is grouped into Stage III disease. (6) A new convention was implemented for defining clinical and pathological staging so as to take into account the new staging information gained from lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy.","654":"","655":"Oncology has always coexisted with therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in biomedicine. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as \"unproven,\" suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown. Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. In this article, clinical trial data on a number of alternative cancer cures including Livingston-Wheeler, Di Bella Multitherapy, antineoplastons, vitamin C, hydrazine sulfate, Laetrile, and psychotherapy are reviewed. The label \"unproven\" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been \"disproven.\"","656":"Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors that arise predominantly from the embryonic mesoderm. They present most commonly as an asymptomatic mass originating in an extremity but can occur anywhere in the body, particularly the trunk, retroperitoneum, or the head and neck. Pretreatment radiologic imaging is critical for defining the local extent of a tumor, staging the disease, guiding biopsies, and aiding in diagnosis. Core-needle biopsy is the preferred biopsy technique for diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for soft tissue sarcomas is based on histologic grade, the tumor size and depth, and the presence of distant or nodal metastases. Despite improvements in local control rates with wide local resections and radiation therapy, metastasis and death remain a significant problem in 50% of patients who present with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas. The most common site of metastasis is the lungs, and metastasis generally occurs within two to three years after the completion of therapy. Progress in the molecular characteristics of these tumors should in the near future translate into molecularly based therapies that can be incorporated into standard treatment strategies.","657":"This article highlights disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival in relation to race\/ethnicity, and census data on poverty in the county or census tract of residence. The incidence and survival data derive from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program; mortality data are from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); data on the prevalence of major cancer risk factors and cancer screening are from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by NCHS. For all cancer sites combined, residents of poorer counties (those with greater than or equal to 20% of the population below the poverty line) have 13% higher death rates from cancer in men and 3% higher rates in women compared with more affluent counties (less than 10% below the poverty line). Differences in cancer survival account for part of this disparity. Among both men and women, five-year survival for all cancers combined is 10 percentage points lower among persons who live in poorer than in more affluent census tracts. Even when census tract poverty rate is accounted for, however, African American, American Indian\/Alaskan Native, and Asian\/Pacific Islander men and African American and American Indian\/Alaskan Native women have lower five-year survival than non-Hispanic Whites. More detailed analyses of selected cancers show large variations in cancer survival by race and ethnicity. Opportunities to reduce cancer disparities exist in prevention (reductions in tobacco use, physical inactivity, and obesity), early detection (mammography, colorectal screening, Pap tests), treatment, and palliative care.","658":"","659":"","660":"Each January, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, including updates, emerging issues that are relevant to screening for cancer, or both. In the spring of 2003, the ACS announced updated guidelines for breast cancer screening, and several other organizations released updated guidelines that we compare with recent ACS updates. Finally, the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening are presented by age and sex from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, as are U.S. maps profiling states based on the proportion of the age-eligible population not recently screened for breast cancer or colorectal cancer.","661":"Every January for more than 40 years, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has estimated the total number of cancer deaths that are expected to occur in the United States and individual states in the upcoming year. In a collaborative effort to improve the accuracy of the predictions, investigators from the National Cancer Institute and the ACS have developed and tested a new prediction method. The new method was used to create the mortality predictions for the first time in Cancer Statistics, 2004 and Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2004. The authors present a conceptual overview of the previous ACS method and the new state-space method (SSM), and they review the results of rigorous testing to determine which method provides more accurate predictions of the observed number of cancer deaths from the years 1997 to 1999. The accuracy of the methods was compared using squared deviations (the square of the predicted minus observed values) for each of the cancer sites for which predictions are published as well as for all cancer sites combined. At the national level, the squared deviations were not consistently lower for every cancer site for either method, but the average squared deviations (averaged across cancer sites, years, and sex) was substantially lower for the SSM than for the ACS method. During the period 1997 to 1999, the ACS estimates of deaths were usually greater than the observed numbers for all cancer sites combined and for several major individual cancer sites, probably because the ACS method was less sensitive to recent changes in cancer mortality rates (and associated counts) that occurred for several major cancer sites in the early and mid 1990s. The improved accuracy of the new method was particularly evident for prostate cancer, for which mortality rates changed dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the state level, the accuracy of the two methods was comparable. Based on these results, the ACS has elected to use the new method for the annual prediction of the number of cancer deaths at the national and state levels.","662":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and mortality rates are age standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,368,030 new cancer cases and 563,700 deaths are expected in the United States in 2004. Incidence rates stabilized among men from 1995 through 2000 but continued to increase among females by 0.4% per year from 1987 through 2000. Mortality rates have decreased by 1.5% per year since 1992 among men, but have stabilized from 1998 through 2000 among women. Cancer death rates continued to decrease from the three major cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and from female breast and colorectal cancers in women. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African-American men and women have 40% and 20% higher death rates from all cancers combined compared with White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and mortality rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than do Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge into practice among all segments of the population.","663":"","664":"","665":"Keratinocyte carcinoma is by far the most common cancer in the United States. Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas account for approximately 80% and 20% of cases of KC, respectively. The term nonmelanoma skin cancer is commonly used to refer to squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas; however, other types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, such as adnexal tumors and sarcomas, are less common and differ in their cell type, behavior, and epidemiologic features from KC. Primary care clinicians are well positioned to diagnose KC and to educate patients about preventive measures such as sun protection and self-examination. Here we review epidemiologic data and strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and clinical management of KC.","666":"Cancer survivors are often highly motivated to seek information about food choices, physical activity, dietary supplement use, and complementary nutritional therapies to improve their treatment outcomes, quality of life, and survival. To address these concerns, the American Cancer Society (ACS) convened a group of experts in nutrition, physical activity, and cancer to evaluate the scientific evidence and best clinical practices related to optimal nutrition and physical activity after the diagnosis of cancer. This report summarizes their findings and is intended to present health care providers with the best possible information on which to help cancer survivors and their families make informed choices related to nutrition and physical activity. The report discusses nutrition and physical activity issues during the phases of cancer treatment and recovery, living after recovery from treatment, and living with advanced cancer; selected nutritional and physical activity issues such as body weight, food choices, and complementary and alternative nutritional options; and selected issues related to breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, head and neck, and upper gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, handouts containing commonly asked questions and answers and a resource list are provided for survivors and families. Tables that grade the scientific evidence for benefit versus harm related to nutrition and physical activity for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers are also included for this growing body of knowledge to provide guidance for informed decision making and to identify areas for future research.","667":"","668":"","669":"As the population of the United States ages, women over the age of 65 have become a prominent cohort in the breast cancer population, with approximately 50% of all new breast cancers occurring in women aged 65 years and older. Early studies in breast cancer often excluded women based on age or comorbidity, leaving physicians and patients with a growing number of diagnostic and treatment options, each of which often carry short-term morbidity risks for potential long-term gain. We review the current data available for diagnosis and treatment of elderly women with breast cancer in both the adjuvant and metastatic disease setting. In addition, the role of screening and new concepts in prevention are discussed with emphasis on the older patient.","670":"In this article, the American Cancer Society (ACS) provides estimates on the number of new cancer cases and deaths, and compiles health statistics on the US Hispanic population. The compiled statistics include cancer incidence, mortality, and behaviors relevant to cancer using the most recent data on incidence from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiolgy, and End Results (SEER) Program, mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics, and behavioral information from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS], Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System [YRBSS], and National Health Interview Survey [NHIS].) An estimated 67,400 new cases of cancer and 22,100 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics in 2003. Hispanics have lower incidence and death rates from all cancers combined and from the four most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and bronchus, and colon and rectum) than non-Hispanic whites. However, Hispanics have higher incidence and mortality rates from cancers of the stomach, liver, uterine cervix, and gallbladder, reflecting in part greater exposure to specific infectious agents and lower rates of screening for cervical cancer, as well as dietary patterns and possible genetic factors. Strategies for reducing cancer risk among Hispanics include further development of effective interventions to increase screening and physical activity, reductions in tobacco use and obesity, and the development and application of effective vaccines.","671":"","672":"","673":"","674":"","675":"","676":"Nearly nine million people living in the United States have had a diagnosis of cancer.

Nicotine is a powerfully addictive substance, and the tobacco industry spends billions annually promoting it in the United States. It is therefore important for clinicians to understand why people smoke, to address smoking in patients of all ages, and to lobby for health-preserving tobacco control policies at the community level. Children take up smoking in response to social influences: smoking by friends, parents, and family, and through exposure to smoking in media. Parents who smoke not only model the behavior, but also often make the product available by leaving cigarettes around the house. Media influences include the dollar 10 billion spent per year on tobacco marketing, but more importantly, the modeling of the behavior on screen by movie and television stars. Once children start smoking, many rapidly lose autonomy over the behavior. Youth can get hooked after smoking just a few cigarettes. The most effective community efforts for reducing tobacco use are: raising the price of tobacco; halting the sale of tobacco to minors; enforcing strict school tobacco policies; and making public places smoke free through local ordinances. Working with individuals, clinicians should support cessation in all smokers, including parents of children and adolescents. They should screen children for smoking risk factors beginning at age 10. They should teach parents to maintain smoke-free households, to set nonsmoking expectations early on, and to monitor adolescents for signs of smoking. Parents should limit exposure to adult media (e.g., R-rated movies) and use family television time to discuss the effect of seeing screen depictions of smoking on adolescent behavior. Adolescents who smoke should be assessed for signs of nicotine dependence and counseled about quitting. Clinicians are effective community voices; they should participate in efforts to raise tobacco taxes, limit the display of tobacco advertising, and make public places smoke free because of the adverse health effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke.","684":"Enrollment into cancer prevention and early detection clinical trials represents a unique challenge compared with a diagnostic or treatment trial because it involves subjects without a diagnosis of cancer.

Although surveys have documented patients' and physicians' willingness to consider participation in clinical research studies, accrual to clinical trials by adults in cancer research studies remains embarrassingly low. This may be due in part to a lack of knowledge about available studies by community oncologists, a lack of time or interest, or a lack of resources to support the cost of performing clinical trials.

In the year 2003, we estimate that 1,334,100 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed, and 556,500 people will die from cancer in the United States. Age-adjusted cancer death rates declined in both males and females in the 1990s, though the magnitude of decline is substantially higher in males than in females. In contrast, incidence rates continued to increase in females while stabilizing in males. African-American males showed the largest decline for mortality. However, African Americans still carry the highest burden of cancer with diagnosis of cancer at a later stage and poorer survival within each stage compared with Whites.

Based on analysis of cytogenetic and molecular data, it is known that leukemic cells in older patients are intrinsically resistant to standard chemotherapy. Due to comorbid disease and impaired bone marrow stem cell reserve, older adults tolerate myelosuppressive chemotherapy poorly, with a treatment-related mortality rate of 25 percent. About 35 percent of adults under age 40 are cured, but the complete remission rate (likelihood of temporary disease eradication) is 45 percent in those over age 60, considerably lower than the 75% rate among younger patients, and the possibility of long-term disease free survival is 20 percent in those achieving remission or less than 10 percent overall. Standard allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is too dangerous to be considered as a means to eradicate minimal residual disease after remission is obtained and myelointensive chemotherapy is not a beneficial post-remission strategy in this age cohort. These disappointing results call for more effective and less toxic therapeutic options. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML and promising early clinical data suggest that the era of truly targeted therapy in this difficult disease may soon be a reality.","694":"An update to the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline regarding screening for the early detection of cervical neoplasia and cancer, based on recommendations from a formal review and recent workshop, is presented.

During the same period, death rates declined by 2.1 percent and 0.4 percent per year among African-American males and females, respectively. The decrease in both incidence and death rates from cancer among African-American males was the largest of any racial or ethnic group. Nonetheless, African Americans still carry the highest cancer burden among US racial and ethnic groups. Most cancers detectable by screening are diagnosed at a later stage and survival rates are lower within each stage of disease in African Americans than in whites.

Although use of DDT and PCBs has been banned in the United States since the 1970s, some organochlorine compounds have accumulated and persisted within the environment. As a result, measurable amounts can still be found in human tissue. Because some organochlorine compounds act as estrogen agonists or antagonists within in vitro and experimental animal systems, a possible association of breast cancer risk with organochlorine exposure has been hypothesized and investigated. Although a few studies support this hypothesis, the vast majority of epidemiological studies do not. While some of these compounds may have other adverse environmental or health effects, organochlorine exposure is not believed to be causally related to breast cancer.

The continued growth in mammographic evaluation and technology has resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS). The resulting guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making for patients with DCIS based on review of relevant literature, and includes information on patient selection and evaluation, technical aspects of surgical treatment, techniques of irradiation, and follow-up care.","700":"","701":"We examined information from community-based and philanthropic organizations to document the cancer-related services that are currently available, establish which services are still needed, and determine who utilizes these formal support networks. In Phase I, 32 of 41 eligible organizations participated in a survey conducted from December 1999 to March 2000. The most common mission focus among participating organizations was information\/referral-centered. The most common services provided were referrals to information resources and provision of cancer-related information. Only two of the organizations in Phase I provided client demographic information and both indicated that client populations were predominantly white, female, and over age 40. Phase II of the study involved analyzing patient data from Cancer Care, Inc., a national service organizations for cancer patients. Between 1983 and 1997, there were 2,714 prostate cancer patients and 9,451 breast cancer patients included in the Cancer Care database. Their most commonly reported problems were related to personal adjustment to illness, financial, home care, and transportation needs. There were significant differences in problems reported depending upon age and disease status. In addition, the results of this study support the idea that those at highest risk for developing and dying of cancer are the least likely to utilize formal support networks. Further, a gap in service provision for assistance with practical needs (e.g., transportation, home care, child care, psychosocial support) was identified. Due to the increasing use of outpatient care for cancer patients, a greater demand for practical assistance can be expected in the future. The availability of practical services will need to be increased in order to effectively meet cancer patient needs.","702":"To provide the clinician with current concepts regarding prevention of ovarian cancer. Specifically, in this review, we provide a rationale for chemoprevention of ovarian cancer, a description of promising chemopreventive agents, and an overview of surgical strategies used in the prevention of ovarian cancer. A computerized search of articles published through December 2001 was performed using the MEDLINE database from the period of 1966 to present. Search terms utilized included ovarian neoplasms, primary prevention, chemoprevention, oral contraceptives, NSAIDs, retinoids, ovariectomy, and tubal sterilization. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. All identified references relevant to prevention of ovarian carcinoma were reviewed. Each reference was reviewed to determine the relevant contribution to the fundamental science of ovarian cancer prevention. Particular attention was paid to those studies that offered insight into the development of translational trials in ovarian cancer chemoprevention. Investigation into chemoprevention for ovarian cancer represents a vastly underdeveloped area of research. Continued research efforts toward identification of novel compounds will accelerate the progress of clinical trials in this neglected area of investigation. ","703":"In the United States, cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx represent approximately three percent of all malignancies in men and two percent of all malignancies in women. The American Cancer Society estimates that 28,900 new cases of oral cancer will be diagnosed in 2002, and nearly 7,400 people will die from this disease. Over 90 percent of these tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, which arise from the oral mucosal lining. In spite of the ready accessibility of the oral cavity to direct examination, these malignancies still are often not detected until a late stage, and the survival rate for oral cancer has remained essentially unchanged over the past three decades. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical features of oral cancer and premalignant oral lesions, with an emphasis on early detection.","704":"","705":"","706":"Androgen deprivation therapy remains a mainstay of treatment for men with prostate cancer. New uses for hormonal therapy, including use in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting, are being evaluated. Prevention of the side effects of therapy has led to the development of alternative schedules and therapeutics.","707":"Health literacy is increasingly recognized as a critical factor affecting communication across the continuum of cancer care. We reviewed research on health literacy and examined its impact on cancer outcomes and communication. According to the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), considered the most accurate portrait of literacy in our society, about one in five American adults may lack the necessary literacy skills to function adequately in our society. As patients, such individuals are at a disadvantage in their capacity to obtain, process, and understand cancer information and services needed to make appropriate health care decisions. Patients with poor health literacy have a complex array of difficulties with written and oral communication that may limit their understanding of cancer screening and of symptoms of cancer, adversely affecting their stage at diagnosis. In addition, these barriers impair communication and discussion about risks and benefits of treatment options, and patient understanding of informed consent for routine procedures and clinical trials. More research is needed to identify successful methods for educating and communicating with patients who have limited health literacy. Based on our own experience, we offer practical communication aids that can help bridge the cancer communication gap.","708":"","709":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) has set aggressive challenge goals for the nation to decrease cancer incidence and mortality--and to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors--by the year 2015. To address these critical goals, the ACS publishes the Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among Americans. These guidelines, published every five years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The American Cancer Society guidelines include recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or interferes with healthy behaviors. Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices for nutrition and physical activity to reduce cancer risk. This recommendation for community action underscores just how important community measures are to the support of healthy behaviors by means of increasing access to healthful food choices and opportunities to be physically active. The ACS guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services' 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.","710":"Cachexia is among the most debilitating and life-threatening aspects of cancer. Associated with anorexia, fat and muscle tissue wasting, psychological distress, and a lower quality of life, cachexia arises from a complex interaction between the cancer and the host. This process includes cytokine production, release of lipid-mobilizing and proteolysis-inducing factors, and alterations in intermediary metabolism. Cachexia should be suspected in patients with cancer if an involuntary weight loss of greater than five percent of premorbid weight occurs within a six-month period. The two major options for pharmacological therapy have been either progestational agents, such as megestrol acetate, or corticosteroids. However, knowledge of the mechanisms of cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome has led to, and continues to lead to, effective therapeutic interventions for several aspects of the syndrome. These include antiserotonergic drugs, gastroprokinetic agents, branched-chain amino acids, eicosapentanoic acid, cannabinoids, melatonin, and thalidomide--all of which act on the feeding-regulatory circuitry to increase appetite and inhibit tumor-derived catabolic factors to antagonize tissue wasting and\/or host cytokine release. Because weight loss shortens the survival time of cancer patients and decreases performance status, effective therapy would extend patient survival and improve quality of life.","711":"","712":"","713":"","714":"","715":"Each year the American Cancer Society publishes a summary of existing recommendations for early cancer detection, including updates, and\/or emerging issues that are relevant to screening for cancer. In last year's article, the guidelines regarding screening for the early detection of prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers were updated, as was the narrative pertaining to testing for early lung cancer detection. Although none of the ACS's guidelines were updated in 2001, work is proceeding on an update of screening recommendations for breast and cervical cancer and an update of these guidelines will be announced in the January\/February 2003 issue of CA. As in previous issues, we review recommendations for the \"cancer-related check-up,\" in which clinical encounters provide case-finding and health counseling opportunities. Finally, we provide an update of the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening by age, gender, and ethnicity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).","716":"","717":"","718":"Every year the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival, using National Cancer Institute (NCI) incidence and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality data. Incidence and death rates are age adjusted to the 1970 US standard population. It is estimated that 1,284,900 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed and 555,500 people will die from cancer in the United States in the year 2002. From 1992 to 1998, cancer death rates declined in males and females, while cancer incidence rates decreased among males and increased slightly among females. Most notably, African-American men showed the largest decline for both incidence and mortality. Nevertheless, African Americans still carry the highest burden of cancer with later-stage cancer diagnosis and poorer survival compared with whites. Despite the continued decline in cancer death rates, the total number of recorded cancer deaths in the United States continues to increase slightly due to the aging and expanding population.","719":"Breast cancer mortality rates have decreased during the last 20 years in the United States overall. However, declines in breast cancer mortality rates differ among individual states. This analysis ranked states from the highest to the lowest percentage change in mortality between 1986 to 1990 and 1991 to 1995. Data on white and black females were analyzed separately. Among white women, the 10 states showing the greatest percentage change in mortality during those two periods had the greatest baseline mortality in the 1986-to-1990 period. Similarly, the 10 states with the lowest percentage change in mortality had the lowest mortality rate in 1986 to 1990. In contrast, among black women, the top 10 states ranked by percentage change in mortality included either a decline or an increase. The disparities in mortality rates by state likely depend on the stage of disease at diagnoses, socioeconomic status, access to care, and adequacy of medical care.","720":"","721":"Gallbladder cancer is usually associated with gallstone disease, late diagnosis, unsatisfactory treatment, and poor prognosis. We report here the worldwide geographical distribution of gallbladder cancer, review the main etiologic hypotheses, and provide some comments on perspectives for prevention. The highest incidence rate of gallbladder cancer is found among populations of the Andean area, North American Indians, and Mexican Americans. Gallbladder cancer is up to three times higher among women than men in all populations. The highest incidence rates in Europe are found in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Incidence rates in other regions of the world are relatively low. The highest mortality rates are also reported from South America, 3.5-15.5 per 100,000 among Chilean Mapuche Indians, Bolivians, and Chilean Hispanics. Intermediate rates, 3.7 to 9.1 per 100,000, are reported from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil. Mortality rates are low in North America, with the exception of high rates among American Indians in New Mexico (11.3 per 100,000) and among Mexican Americans. The main associated risk factors identified so far include cholelithiasis (especially untreated chronic symptomatic gallstones), obesity, reproductive factors, chronic infections of the gallbladder, and environmental exposure to specific chemicals. These suspected factors likely represent promoters of carcinogenesis. The main limitations of epidemiologic studies on gallbladder cancer are the small sample sizes and specific problems in quantifying exposure to putative risk factors. The natural history of gallbladder disease should be characterized to support the allocation of more resources for early treatment of symptomatic gallbladder disease in high-risk populations. Secondary prevention of gallbladder cancer could be effective if supported by cost-effective studies of prophylactic cholecystectomy among asymptomatic gallstone patients in high-risk areas.","722":"Residential and occupational exposure to radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking. As many as eight million homes in the US have elevated radon levels according to Environmental Protection Agency estimates. High exposure levels in homes are largely a result of radon-contaminated gas rising from the soil. This makes it an unusual indoor air pollutant in that it has a natural source. This study examines the synergism between smoking and radon, what levels are considered safe, and what to do to safeguard against overexposure to radon.","723":"Although it is generally acknowledged that comorbidity has a significant impact on treatment selection and outcomes for elderly patients with cancer, an understanding of how comorbid conditions should influence clinical decisions is quite incomplete. This issue remains an important and challenging area of geriatric oncology research. Measures of comorbidity require recognition, documentation, and accurate data extraction. Extensive prospective evaluations and medical chart reviews have the greatest reliability but are costly. Administrative data are convenient and applicable to large populations, but suffer from relatively poor reliability and therefore should be used with caution. Perhaps in the future more refined nosology and better information systems will improve our understanding and ability to use administrative data sets to study comorbidity in the elderly--the eventual goal of such investigation being evidence-based criteria for care of elderly cancer patients.","724":"The burden of cancer is felt disproportionately among the elderly with the majority of cancers occurring in adults over the age of 65.

CA will continue this series on geriatric oncology in future issues.","725":"","726":"","727":"Many studies have been conducted about dietary interventions aimed at preventing cancer. The American Cancer Society has published guidelines on diet, nutrition and cancer prevention, which are updated periodically as new evidence emerges, and other groups, too, have issued statements or guidelines about nutritional strategies to prevent cancer. Much less is known, however, about optimal nutrition for cancer survivors. This report looks at the different phases of cancer survivorship, from active treatment to advanced disease, and presents existing evidence from which informed decisions can be made regarding dietary choices. Popular complementary and alternative methods related to dietary intervention are reviewed. Nutrition information is also provided according to common cancer sites. As this is an area that requires survivors and health care providers to communicate effectively, a special section on \"frequently asked questions\" is provided for use as a patient education handout.","728":"A diagnosis of cancer is often accompanied by feelings of loss of control.

This side effect causes significant morbidity and may delay the treatment plan, as well as increase therapeutic expenses. The pathogenesis of this debilitating side effect can be attributed to the direct mucosal toxicity of cytotoxic agents and ionizing radiation and to indirect mucosal damage caused by a concomitant inflammatory reaction exacerbated in the presence of neutropenia, and the emergence of bacterial, mycotic, and viral infections. The prophylactic and therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of oral mucositis consists of locally and systemically applied nonpharmacological measures and pharmacotherapeutics.","730":"Multiple myeloma is a currently incurable malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells. It typically occurs in older patients (median age 71 years). Clinical manifestations result from monoclonal protein (immunoglobulin) production and its accumulation in the serum and\/or urine, anemia, lytic bone disease, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and immune deficiency. Myeloma cells have low proliferative activity--most myeloma experts opine that the initial oncogenic event occurs 10-15 years before clinical disease manifestation. In addition, myeloma cells develop multiple chromosomal abnormalities, which may explain the native resistance of myeloma patients to conventional therapy and our inability to completely eradicate the disease. Indeed, with conventional therapy, only 5% of patients achieve complete response. Minimal improvement has been observed with conventional therapies over the past 20-30 years; the median duration of initial response remains approximately 18 months with median survival in the 36-month range. However, recent clinical trials have established high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant as superior to conventional therapy: complete remission rates of 25-30% can be affected with median survival exceeding 5 years. Newer approaches to improve treatment outcomes are in active clinical trials including: more potent induction regimens utilizing thalidomide, alone or in combination with dexamethasone; tandem transplants to improve complete remission rates; newer approaches to maintenance therapy using thalidomide with corticosteroids; non-myeloablative therapy with allogeneic transplant; and post-transplant vaccinations.","731":"With conventional therapy, only 5% of multiple myeloma patients achieve complete response.

The current controversy over the appropriate Federal limit for arsenic in drinking water highlights some of the difficult scientific, ethical, economic, and political issues that complicate standard-setting in occupational and environmental health. These include limitations in the scientific evidence concerning the risk at low doses, uncertainty about the appropriate mathematical models for estimating the risk at low-level exposures based on data from higher-level exposures, and controversies concerning the appropriate safety margin, level of evidence required for standard-setting, and costs of remediation.","733":"Patients with advanced cancer commonly experience nausea, vomiting, and\/or retching (NVR) as a result of the malignant process and its treatment. Recently, increasing attention is being focused on end-of-life care, which includes relief or reduction of symptoms such as NVR. Pre-chemotherapy preparation and patient education in the palliative care setting are essential to preventing acute and delayed distress from NVR, as well as anticipatory symptoms. Careful assessment of chemotherapy-related symptoms should distinguish between the three phenomena rather than taking a global approach. Strategies for preventing anticipatory nausea, for instance, may differ significantly from those designed to reduce frequency of vomiting. Management of anticancer treatment-related NVR should incorporate both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, whenever appropriate, with the overall goal of improving and\/or maintaining the patient's quality of life.","734":"Changes in the health care system have resulted in a shift of cancer care from the in-patient arena to ambulatory and home settings. This shift has likewise translated into increased family involvement in the day-to-day care of the person with cancer. Cancer patients have multifaceted needs, including disease and treatment monitoring, symptom management, medication administration, emotional support, assistance with personal care, and assistance with instrument care. Family caregivers may be ill prepared to assume these tasks, requiring information on the disease and treatment, as well as instruction in technical and care skills. Moreover, caregiving must be balanced against already established roles and role responsibilities. In addition, family caregivers have their own emotional responses to the patients' diagnosis and prognosis, and may require coaching and emotional support themselves. The health care system can facilitate positive outcomes by embracing the family caregiver as a partner in the health care team, providing instruction and guidance to the caregiver as he\/she assumes this role, and evaluating the home care situation. Research to date has only scratched the surface of testing interventions that meet the needs of the cancer caregiver. A research agenda is proposed to more fully elucidate the cancer caregiver's experience throughout the illness and treatment trajectory, and identify the means to effecting positive outcomes for the person with cancer, their family caregiver, and the health care system.","735":"","736":"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Because of its association with human papilloma virus infection, as well as the ability to screen for premalignant stages of the disease, it is now largely a preventable disease. This article describes the molecular basis for cervical cancer, and presents a clinical overview of current treatment approaches and technological advances, emphasizing the unique aspects of this viral disease as it relates to the immune system and vaccination or other immunotherapeutic strategies.","737":"The decline in deaths from cervical cancer in the US, as well as the improved survival of women with advanced disease have resulted, according to Dr. Rubin, from widespread application of routine screening with the Pap test, the emergence of gynecologic oncology as a distinct medical subspecialty, and the completion of important clinical trials.","738":"","739":"","740":"As cellular telephones are a relatively new technology, we do not yet have long-term follow-up on their possible biological effects. However, the lack of ionizing radiation and the low energy level emitted from cell phones and absorbed by human tissues make it unlikely that these devices cause cancer. Moreover, several well-designed epidemiologic studies find no consistent association between cell phone use and brain cancer. It is impossible to prove that any product or exposure is absolutely safe, especially in the absence of very long-term follow-up. Accordingly, the following summary from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health offers advice to people concerned about their risk: If there is a risk from these products--and at this point we do not know that there is--it is probably very small. But if people are concerned about avoiding even potential risks, there are simple steps they can take to do so. People who must conduct extended conversations in their cars every day could switch to a type of mobile phone that places more distance between their bodies and the source of the RF, since the exposure level drops off dramatically with distance. For example, they could switch to: a mobile phone in which the antenna is located outside the vehicle, a hand-held phone with a built-in antenna connected to a different antenna mounted on the outside of the car or built into a separate package, or a headset with a remote antenna to a mobile phone carried at the waist. Again the scientific data do not demonstrate that mobile phones are harmful. But if people are concerned about the radiofrequency energy from these products, taking the simple precautions outlined above can reduce any possible risk. In addition, people who are concerned might choose digital rather than analog telephones, since the former use lower RF levels.","741":"Despite her scientific training and experience in medical practice, after being diagnosed with an indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the author was subjected to intense pressure about alternative therapies from well-meaning friends and relatives. While insulated at first from these forces, disease recurrences and progression increased her vulnerability to the lure of seemingly gentler approaches. A data-driven study of alternative therapeutic methods, however, convinced the author that investigational strategies offered her a better chance of cure or improvement than unproven alternative methods. She offers guidelines for physicians about what patients want, and emphasizes the importance of hope, caring, and information.","742":"Cancer is still the chief cause of death by disease in children, ages one to 14. As improved survival rates have been reported for pediatric cancer patients who are treated on controlled clinical trials, it is important to understand the national utilization of such protocols. In 1993, a survey of childhood cancer was conducted by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. Data regarding type of disease, protocol participation, age, sex, race, insurance, and geographical region were voluntarily submitted by more than 200 hospital cancer registries. Included in this study were 2,208 children and adolescents 21 years of age or younger who were diagnosed in 1987, and 2,293 who were diagnosed in 1992. Pediatric centers (i.e., members of the Pediatric Oncology Group or Children's Cancer Group) submitted 55.1% of the cases and other institutions, 44.9%. It was found that more patients treated at pediatric centers were on protocols (53.8%) than were those treated at other institutions (25.1%). In general, the younger the patient (five years of age or younger), the greater the chance of being on protocol (pediatric centers, 63.7%; others, 42.0%), with very poor adolescent protocol participation (pediatric centers, 34.8%; others, 12.1%). Nevertheless, overall protocol participation was still lower than expected, even in children younger than five years of age, and adolescent participation in controlled clinical trials was low and similar to adult figures. The percentage of childhood cancer cases seen at pediatric centers was smaller than in other series. It was concluded that pediatric cancer centers need to continue to encourage patient participation in controlled clinical trials, with special emphasis on adolescents.","743":"Updates to the American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines regarding screening for the early detection of prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers, based on the recommendations of recent ACS workshops, are presented. Additionally, the authors review the \"cancer-related check-up,\" clinical encounters that provide case-finding and health counseling opportunities. Finally, the ACS is issuing an updated narrative related to testing for early lung cancer detection for clinicians and individuals at high risk of lung cancer in light of emerging data on new imaging technologies. Although it is likely that current screening protocols will be supplanted in the future by newer, more effective technologies, the establishment of an organized and systematic approach to early cancer detection would lead to greater utilization of existing technology and greater progress in cancer control.","744":"Each year the American Cancer Society compiles estimates of the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the US in the current year and the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. An estimated 1,268,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the year 2001 and an estimated 553,400 Americans will die from cancer. Overall cancer incidence and death rates have continued to decrease in men and women since the early 1990s, and the decline in overall cancer mortality has been greater in recent years. Despite reductions in age-adjusted rates of cancer death, the total number of recorded cancer deaths in the US continues to increase, due to an aging and expanding population. Large disparities in cancer incidence and mortality across racial\/ethnic groups continue. Black men and women experience higher incidence of cancer and poorer survival than white men and women. The disparity in survival reflects both diagnosis of cancer at later disease stages, and poorer survival within each stage of diagnosis.","745":"In his first Guest Editorial for CA as newly elected President of the American Cancer Society, Dr. Dileep Bal moves beyond the encouraging trends reported in the annual cancer statistics article to target areas for future efforts and improvement. Noting that resources and the public health activities of local, regional, and national medical communities should focus on cancer prevention, screening and early detection\/treatment, technology transfer, and research, Dr. Bal emphasizes the feasibility of the 2015 goals set by the ACS: A 25% reduction in cancer incidence and a 50% reduction in mortality from cancer.","746":"The leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States is epithelial ovarian cancer. The significant risk factor for development of ovarian cancer is advancing age, although there is clearly a genetic predisposition--often associated with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes--in at least 5% to 10% of all epithelial ovarian cancers. Oral contraceptives are known to reduce the risk for development of ovarian cancer and should be considered as a method of birth control in women at increased risk. Currently, there is no acceptable method of screening for this disease, although measurement of CA-125 level and transvaginal ultrasound have been utilized. Ovarian cancer is a surgically staged disease. In apparent early-stage disease, complete surgical staging is critical for the selection of adjunctive therapy. In advanced-stage disease, the goal is primary cytoreduction. Standard postoperative therapy for advanced-stage ovarian cancer includes platinum-based chemotherapy with the substitution of paclitaxel for cyclophosphamide occurring in the last decade. Despite these advances in chemotherapy, ovarian cancer continues to be fatal in far too many cases.","747":"With current clinical practice, most newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are potentially life-threatening yet still curable. The anatomical (nerve-sparing) radical prostatectomy has dramatically improved the results of surgical treatment. Other new management options, including conformal (three-dimensional) external beam radiation therapy, radioactive seed implantation (brachytherapy), cryoablation, and hormonal therapy, may be useful in some patients, but they are all probably less effective than radical prostatectomy. Suitability for radical prostatectomy generally requires a clinically localized, potentially life-threatening tumor [as defined by Gleason grade, tumor stage, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level], a life expectancy of 10 years, and no serious co-morbid medical conditions. With contemporary radical prostatectomy, about 70% of men with clinically localized disease will be cured, depending on tumor grade, tumor stage, and the serum PSA level. Urinary continence and sexual potency can be preserved in most patients, but substantially better results have been reported from centers of excellence than from community-based series. Other complications occur in about 10% of patients and with greater frequency in older patients. The operative mortality rate is less than 0.5%. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy does not appear to affect treatment failure rates in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Prostatectomy may be beneficial in patients with microscopic lymph node metastases. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy may also be beneficial for patients with adverse pathologic findings. Salvage radical prostatectomy after radiation failure is associated with a 10-fold higher risk of complications and limited prospects for cure. Prospective, randomized clinical trials are underway to compare the results of radical prostatectomy with other treatments. Currently, radical prostatectomy is considered the preferred treatment for men with localized disease and a 10-year life expectancy.","748":"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most important of all tumor markers in that it has significant applications in all aspects of the management of men with prostatic disease. Certainly, the most important utilization of PSA is for the early detection of this most ubiquitous of all human neoplasms. This article reviews the salient features of PSA, with particular emphasis on strategies to improve its utility in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. So-called PSA derivatives--including age-specific PSA, PSA velocity, and PSA density--are discussed. With the recognition of molecular forms of PSA, however, the ratio of free-to-total PSA, and now the complex form of PSA, have been shown to be more specific indicators of the presence of malignancy. Significant public interest and research efforts in prostate cancer have resulted in numerous advances over the past decade. The discovery of PSA and the development of assays to measure it will undoubtedly be recorded as one of the most important advances in the management of men with prostate cancer.","749":"","750":"\"Complementary and alternative\" therapies are actually a vast collection of disparate, unrelated regimens and products, ranging from adjunctive modalities that effectively enhance quality of life and promising antitumor herbal remedies now under investigation, to bogus therapies that claim to cure cancer and that harm not only directly, but also indirectly by encouraging patients to avoid or postpone effective cancer care. Complementary therapies such as music and massage, herbal teas to aid digestion and relieve nausea, yoga, tai chi, meditation, and the many other well-documented techniques that relieve stress and enhance well-being should be made available to patients to augment and ease the experience of cancer treatment and recovery. Many time-tested herbal and diet-based remedies are now being studied for their abilities to induce or extend remission without toxicity. At the same time, lack of government regulatory authority leaves consumers at the mercy of those who promote unproved remedies, scores of which the grocery store and pharmacy shelves. Many of these over-the-counter products contain harmful ingredients. Herb-drug interactions, only some of which are documented, occur with frequency and are sufficiently problematic to require that patients stop taking herbal remedies prior to surgery (to prevent interactions with anesthetics and anticoagulant effects); before radiation (due to potential for increased photosensitivity); and during courses of chemotherapy (to prevent product-drug interactions). Moreover, both good information and misinformation that appear in printed materials and on the Internet appeal to better educated consumers, who are, in fact, the most likely to try complementary and alternative methods.","751":"Randomized controlled trials are regarded as the most definitive of study designs. The randomized controlled trials that have tested nutritional factors for cancer prevention are reviewed. Trials that have tested the effects of nutrients given as high-dose supplements have been largely disappointing, typically showing either no or harmful effects. Possible benefits of vitamin E for prostate cancer prevention and selenium for prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer prevention have emerged only as secondary endpoints in trials conducted for other purposes; confirmatory new trials for these nutrients are now underway or are planned. The limitations of both past and current randomized controlled trials for studying diet-cancer relationships are discussed. The disappointing findings that have emerged from short-term studies of high-dose supplements cannot be interpreted as direct tests of the diet-cancer relationship because high-dose supplements cannot fully simulate the effects of whole foods on cancer risk. As we await findings from current and future trials, we should not forget that the ample evidence from observational epidemiologic research--suggesting that diets rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of many of the most common cancers--can provide a sound basis for nutritional recommendations aimed at reducing cancer risk.","752":"Ongoing research continues to support the hypothesis that dietary factors significantly influence the incidence of many human malignancies. Despite some conflicting and confusing studies reported over the past two decades, it is becoming increasingly clear that maintenance of a healthy adult weight, through proper balance of caloric intake and physical activity, is key to cancer prevention. Moreover, current nutritional recommendations for the prevention of cancer include increased consumption of fruits and vegetables; reduced consumption of red meat and animal fat; and avoidance of excessive alcohol use. For many individuals, a daily multivitamin that contains folic acid may also be part of a reasonable overall cancer prevention strategy.","753":"","754":"","755":"The goal of harnessing the immune system to recognize tumor as \"nonself\" is not new.

Hepatic resection in appropriately selected patients remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with such metastases. Recommendations for preoperative patient evaluation, patient selection, adjuvant therapy, and postoperative follow-up are presented. Other surgical modalities utilized in the treatment of unresectable or recurrent hepatic colorectal metastases, including ablative modalities and surgical delivery of regional chemotherapy, are described.","761":"Laparoscopic treatment of colorectal cancer has emerged as a result of the technical advances that have been made since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The minimal-access approach to treatment of benign disease results in smaller incisions, reduced length of hospital stay, and a faster return to productive life. Laparoscopic approaches to colon cancer must take into consideration the potential effects of the technique on tumor dissemination at the time of the surgical procedure, as well as rates of recurrence and overall survival. Several technical approaches to laparascopic colon resection have now become possible, utilizing either total intra-abdominal maneuvers or laparoscopic-assisted techniques. Margins of resection and lymph node removal with the minimal-access techniques compare favorably with those of open colectomy. Several series now show that early results utilizing laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer are favorable but that routine implementation of this procedure should await confirmatory outcomes generated by well-done prospective clinical trials.","762":"Adjuvant therapy, believed by some to be of no benefit for colorectal cancer as recently as 10 years ago, now offers thousands of patients considerable hope after surgical resection. The first effective adjuvant regimen--combined fluorouracil (5-FU) and levamisole--described in 1989, was soon supplanted by a variety of 5-FU-based regimens, usually combined with leucovorin. Although most recent research in the adjuvant setting has focused on refining chemotherapy doses, schedules, and combinations, with the aim of improving efficacy and decreasing toxicity, investigators have also explored other approaches, such as portal vein infusion, monoclonal antibodies, interferon-alpha, and vaccines. Future directions being evaluated for adjuvant therapy of colon cancer include the use of oral fluorinated pyrimidines, which may replace current intravenous treatments, as well as the incorporation of new agents, such as oxaliplatin and CPT-11, into adjuvant chemotherapy programs.","763":"","764":"The choice of treatment for clinically organ-confined prostate cancer is complicated by the fact that there are no studies demonstrating the clear superiority of one option. As a radiation oncologist who performs both external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, Dr. Roach provides a fascinating and balanced perspective on how he views the selection process, as well as how he approaches a decision.","765":"Of all the treatment options available for men with organ-confined prostate cancer, brachytherapy--permament implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate gland--is the least disruptive for the patient, both physiologically and practically. Early brachytherapy represents the oldest technique for delivering radiation to the prostate gland, preceding external beam therapy of the prostate by several decades. Although there have not been, and are not likely to be, any definitive randomized studies comparing radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy, treatment decisions will continue to be made on the basis of patient and physician preferences in conjunction with clinical probabilities. Long-term results in this series show that monotherapy with seed implants achieved disease-free survival of 66%; moreover, 79% of patients with higher grade disease who were treated with a combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation also experienced long-term disease-free survival. The following article provides a brief historical review of prostate brachytherapy, rationale for treatments, patient selection criteria, up-to-date implant techniques, and long-term (12-year) outcome results.","766":"Men with non-metastatic prostate cancer have many treatment options. For over 35 years, radiation therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for this disease. With improvements in technology and better use of pretreatment prognostic factors, such as prostate specific antigen level and Gleason score, biochemical and clinical results have steadily improved. This article reviews the current status of radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. Results of treatment utilizing three-dimensional conformal and conventional techniques are compared and contrasted. The appropriate use of adjuvant hormones and particle beam therapy in the management of this disease is also discussed. Finally, the toxicity and future directions of radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer are addressed.","767":"","768":"In the hope of resolving underlying policy questions related to the value of breast cancer screening with mammography for women younger than 50 years of age, the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute in 1997 jointly sponsored a consensus conference on the subject. While the panel concluded that the data were insufficient to endorse mammography for this age group apart from individual choice, the conclusion was not the \"consensus\" sought by many of those with strong opinions on both sides of this issue, and the debate raged on. Prior to the 1997 conference, and since, meta-analyses of trial data and assessments of service screening programs have indicated that breast cancer screening with mammography for women between 40 and 49 meets recommended levels of performance compared with performance in women 50 years and older, especially if programs achieve high quality and screen at 12-to-18 month intervals. Because the detectable preclinical phase is shorter in younger women who develop breast cancer compared with that in women 50 years of age or older, a key component of any screening program for those younger than 50 is an appropriate screening interval. Many of the screening programs that had historically been developed for women in their forties--and whose disappointing results contributed to the confusion and controversy about the efficacy of mammography in younger women--had a 24-month screening interval, which was not found to be of significant benefit for early detection of breast cancer in this age group. While a new emphasis of this controversy has focused on the balance of benefits and harms in women ages 40 to 49, women of all ages need to be fully informed about the benefits and limitations of breast cancer screening--more specifically, what to expect at the time of screening, and what to expect from screening. There are differences in the performance and effectiveness of mammography in different age groups of women aged 40 and older, but these differences are not so great to question the value of screening in any one group. While some questions remain unresolved, the efficacy of mammography in women ages 40 to 49 should no longer be considered controversial.","769":"Lymphedema is a common and troublesome problem that can develop following breast cancer treatment. As with other quality-of-life and nonlethal conditions, it receives less research funding and attention than do many other areas of study. In 1998, an invited workshop sponsored by the American Cancer Society reviewed and evaluated the current state of knowledge about lymphedema. Recommendations and research initiatives proposed by the 60 international participants are presented in the conclusion section of the article, following a summary of current knowledge of the anatomy, physiology, detection, and current treatment of lymphedema. The etiology of lymphedema is multifaceted; all of the factors that contribute to the condition and the nature of their interaction have not yet been identified. To compound the problem, methods of assessing the degree of arm and hand swelling vary and are not agreed upon, and reliable methods of assessing the functional impact of lymphedema have not yet been developed. In the absence of a cure for lymphedema, precautions and prevention are emphasized. Current treatments include elevation, elastic garments, pneumatic compression pumps, and complete decongestive therapy; surgical and medical techniques remain controversial. Elements and details of these treatments are described.","770":"Because the tumor status of the regional lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor in patients with early-stage breast cancer, accurate histopathologic assessment of these nodes is essential for optimal management, including the selection of candidates for adjuvant systemic therapies. Intraoperative lymphatic mapping using a vital blue dye, with or without a radiocolloid, can identify the first axillary node to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary breast carcinoma. Focused histopathologic assessment of this sentinel node can be used to determine the tumor status of the entire axillary basin. The minimal morbidity and high accuracy of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in breast cancer have been validated by multiple independent investigators, and the data suggest that this surgical technique may eventually replace complete lymph node dissection as the preferred axillary procedure for the management of early-stage disease. In experienced hands, SLND can be successfully performed in more than 90% of eligible breast cancer patients; the tumor status of the sentinel node accurately predicts the status of all axillary nodes in more than 95% of cases. This article reviews the current status, controversies, and future directions of SLND as a staging technique for patients with primary breast carcinoma.","771":"","772":"","773":"This review focuses on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although much is needed to improve the still dismal outlook for patients with this disease, significant progress has been made in its surgical and oncologic management. Furthermore, our deepening understanding of the molecular genetics of pancreatic cancer lends hope for the possibility of earlier detection, which would result in substantial improvements in survival.","774":"Malignant melanoma continues to present a significant public health problem as its incidence is rising faster than that of any other cancer in the US. At current rates, 1 in 74 Americans will develop melanoma during his or her lifetime. Management of melanoma is a complex issue requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The most effective method of protection against the development of melanoma is minimization of ultraviolet exposure from sunlight. Early detection and treatment are critical and result in improved patient survival rates. Surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment but many new promising therapies are being investigated. It is hoped that increased public and professional awareness and education in all areas relating to the prevention, detection, and treatment of malignant melanoma will contribute to decreasing trends in the incidence and mortality from this cancer in the future.","775":"","776":"","777":"","778":"The widespread utilization of screening mammography has produced a shift in the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis in the US: Currently, 12% to 15% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases annually are ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). The diagnosis is made, in at least 90% of patients, with mammography. Only about 10% of patients will have a palpable mass. The accurate characterization and visualization of calcifications typically requires magnification of mammographic imaging. The morphology of the calcifications is generally considered to be the most important factor in differentiating benign from malignant formations. Round and uniform shapes are more likely to be benign, while linear and heterogeneous morphologies are associated with DCIS. Following a complete mammographic work-up, most suspicious lesions are potential candidates for a stereotactic core needle biopsy. Ten percent to 50% of patients initially diagnosed with atypical ductal hyperplasia by needle biopsy have subsequently been surgically diagnosed with cancer near the biopsy site. Due to this relatively high incidence of co-existent carcinoma, a needle biopsy diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia necessitates subsequent surgical excision. The most important change in our thinking about DCIS was from a monolithic view, conceiving of DCIS as a single disease highly likely to invade if left untreated, to the realization that DCIS represents a non-obligate precursor with a variable risk of progression, depending on a combination of factors, such as histology, lesion, size, and margin status. In discussing treatment options, patients should understand that local recurrence following total mastectomy is rare and that this is the procedure of choice for disease that cannot be adequately encompassed with a breast-conserving approach. If the patient and her surgeon are in agreement about proceeding with a breast-conserving approach, there needs to be a clear understanding of the incidence and implications of local recurrence. In all such discussions with newly diagnosed patients, however, it is essential to emphasize the excellent prognosis with this disease, irrespective of the surgical approach.","779":"The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is the empirical data collection and analysis arm of the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, and is supported in part by the American Cancer Society. The NCDB collects oncology patient demographic information, diagnostic and treatment information, and outcomes data from a broad spectrum of hospital-based cancer registries throughout the US, ranging from large research and teaching facilities to small community hospitals. Through this unique network, data are aggregated and reported back to participating hospitals to allow individual facilities to evaluate local patient care practices and outcomes. This article highlights the principal findings of articles published in 1999 and early 2000 that used NCDB data as the empirical basis of their analyses. Included among these are articles on breast cancer, gastric carcinoma, head and neck cancers, leukemia, liver carcinoma, lung cancer, parathyroid tumors, prostate carcinoma, small bowel adenocarcinoma, testicular malignancies, and vulvar melanoma. These articles are based on cases diagnosed between 1985 and 1996. The NCDB has accrued more than 6.4 million cancer cases for this time period. Sufficient numbers of rare cancers are reported to the NCDB to permit some types of clinical evaluation not possible using other data sources.","780":"The National Cancer Institute has created a breast cancer risk assessment tool that quickly estimates a woman's individualized absolute risk of developing breast cancer. Understanding the magnitude of risk is important because recent data show that breast cancer incidence may be reduced. All women may improve their overall health and thus perhaps minimize breast cancer risk by maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding cigarettes, limiting alcohol consumption, getting regular exercise, and avoiding non-diagnostic ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, no lifestyle modifications have yet been proven to prevent or definitively lower the risk of breast cancer. In addition, women whose personal breast cancer risk is high may consider reducing risk by pharmacologic or surgical means. In such women, a five-year course of tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49%; women with lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia experienced even greater risk reductions. Because of the potential for vascular and endometrial side effects, women who are candidates for a preventive course of tamoxifen must be counseled regarding its relative risks and benefits. Prophylactic mastectomy offers at least a 90% reduction in the risk of breast cancer, but the physical and psychological changes involved in such a procedure make it a difficult choice for many women. Breast cancer risk assessment and appropriate counseling are becoming standard components of breast cancer screening and overall health maintenance.","781":"Helping cigarette smokers to permanently stop smoking is one of the most effective ways to prevent cancer. A physician's instruction to a patient to stop smoking and to offer assistance in this endeavor is an important motivator. Current guidelines state that clinicians should encourage all smokers who want to quit to use medications and should offer psychosocial therapies, as well. It has been shown that even brief clinician advice about smoking cessation increases quit rates. Five medications--bupropion, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine patch--and one proven psychosocial therapy (behavior therapy) appear equally effective and safe; i.e., they all double quit rates and are associated with a less than 5% dropout rate due to adverse events. In 1998, approximately one third of those who attempted to quit smoking used a medication. Attending group behavior therapy to supplement medications increases quit rates but is not essential for medications to work. As there are no proven treatment-matching protocols, patients should choose the treatment(s) they believe will be most effective for them. In the future, people who continue to smoke will be individuals with severe nicotine dependence or psychiatric symptoms; thus, clinicians will increasingly be called on to provide pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.","782":"","783":"","784":"","785":"Cancer care extends from diagnosis through the late stages of advanced illness as patients confront dying and their families cope with caregiving and grief. Palliative care is a rapidly developing area of clinical focus that offers valuable services to patients in terms of symptom management and adjustment to illness, including issues of life completion and life closure. It is often appropriate to offer certain elements of palliative care early in the course of illness. As disease progresses, physical comfort and enhancing quality of life increasingly become primary goals of cancer care. Specialized palliative care programs, epitomized by hospice, are invaluable resources for patients with far-advanced illness and their families. Current regulations and prevailing payment structures limit access to and the scope of hospice services and highlight the need for innovative models of delivering and financing palliative care.","786":"Any therapeutic strategy developed for patients experiencing cancer pain depends on the goals of care, which can be broadly categorized as prolonging survival, optimizing comfort, and optimizing function. The relative priority of these goals for any individual should direct therapeutic decision-making. By combining primary treatments, systemic analgesic agents, and other techniques, most cancer patients can achieve satisfactory relief of pain. In cases where pain appears refractory to these interventions, invasive anesthetic or neurosurgical maneuvers may be necessary, and sedation may be offered to those with unrelieved pain at the end of life. The principles of analgesic therapy are presented, as well as the practical issues involved in drug administration, ranging from calculating dosage to adverse effects, and, when necessary, how to switch and\/or combine therapies. Adjuvant analgesics, which are drugs indicated for purposes other than relief of pain but which may have analgesic effects, are also listed and discussed in some detail. Surgical and neurodestructive techniques, such as rhizotomy or cordotomy, although not frequently required or performed, represent yet other options for patients with unremitting pain and diminished hope of relief. Although cancer pain can be a complex medical problem arising from multiple sources, patients should be assured that suffering is not inevitable and that relief is attainable.","787":"","788":"This review explores factors potentially contributing to the disparity in survival after breast cancer between African-American and Caucasian women in the United States. A number of factors have been implicated as the cause of poorer survival for black women, including clinical and pathologic features of the disease that are indicative of poor prognosis, economic resource inequities, and differences in treatment access and efficacy. The latter is explored in detail using data from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), a nationwide multicenter clinical trials group for breast and colorectal cancers. Key studies into the disparity in breast cancer survival are reviewed according to proposed principal determinants of poorer outcome for black women. Results among black and white women participating in several randomized NSABP clinical trials are also presented. Primary endpoints in those studies were clinical and pathologic disease characteristics at study entry, time to disease progression or new cancers, and total survival time after breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. In most studies reported in the literature, the primary explanatory factor alone, such as stage of disease at diagnosis, did not fully account for differences in outcome between groups; when additional factors were taken into account, however, prognoses became more similar. Results from the NSABP clinical trials similarly indicated that when stage of disease and treatment were comparable, outcomes for blacks did not differ markedly from those of whites. In summary, black women, diagnosed at comparable disease stage as white women and treated appropriately, tend to experience similar breast cancer prognoses and survival. However, important clinical and pathologic disease characteristics may continue to place certain women at increased risk of poorer outcome, and warrant continued study. The opportunity for increased clinical trial participation by black women is encouraged.","789":"This issue of CA inaugurates a yearly report on American Cancer Society guidelines for early detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals. The current recommendations, which reflect almost 20 years of updates, cover screening recommendations for breast, colorectal, prostate, and cervical cancers, as well as for other cancers, depending on patient age, history, environmental and\/or occupational exposures, etc. A key concept for both the general public and health providers is the distinction between public health recommendations regarding screening and decisions about early detection tests that might be undertaken on an individual basis. Although it is likely that current screening protocols will be supplanted by newer technologies, such as genetic and molecular markers of risk and disease, greater utilization of the technologies at hand will improve efforts toward establishing an organized and systematic approach to early cancer detection.","790":"The Surveillance Research Program of the American Cancer Society's Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance Research reports its annual compilation of estimated cancer incidence, mortality, and survival data for the United States in the year 2000. After 70 years of increases, the recorded number of total cancer deaths among men in the US declined for the first time from 1996 to 1997. This decrease in overall male mortality is the result of recent down-turns in lung and bronchus cancer deaths, prostate cancer deaths, and colon and rectum cancer deaths. Despite decreasing numbers of deaths from female breast cancer and colon and rectum cancer, mortality associated with lung and bronchus cancer among women continues to increase. Lung cancer is expected to account for 25% of all female cancer deaths in 2000. This report also includes a summary of global cancer mortality rates using data from the World Health Organization.","791":"","792":"","793":"The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a joint project of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society, collects and analyzes data from a wide variety of sources throughout the United States, including small community hospitals.

This article highlights the principal findings of the NCDB and Patient Care Evaluation articles published in 1998 on breast, prostate, cervical, endometrial, gallbladder, head and neck, nasopharyngeal, rectal, thyroid, and vaginal cancers, as well as on melanoma, brain tumors, and Hodgkin's disease.

Nevertheless, after treatment is complete, many survivors continue to feel a profound tiredness that affects almost all aspects of life. Even after recovery, patients are often frustrated by their continuing need for extra rest. In this deeply personal, first-person account, a physician relates the various ways that cancer-related fatigue can affect family dynamics, job responsibilities, social interactions, finances, and intimacy. Clinicians can help by searching for treatable medical conditions, but also by taking cancer-related fatigue, and the frustrations it causes, seriously. Patients should be reassured that the fatigue they feel is real, and that by learning personal energy conservation, they should be able to improve their abilities to function, to socialize, to interact with others, and ultimately to adjust to a \"new normal\" baseline.","797":"Findings from major National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project studies in women with breast cancer and negative axillary nodes are reported and discussed. Results of the B-13 and B-19 studies demonstrated that systemic chemotherapy (either with methotrexate and sequentially administered fluorouracil followed by leucovorin, or with cyclophosphamide plus methotrexate and fluorouracil) increased overall disease-free survival in women 49 years of age or younger, as well as in those 50 years old or older. Women older than 50 also experienced a survival advantage with chemotherapy. Moreover, women who received systemic chemotherapy after lumpectomy plus radiation therapy were significantly less likely to develop an ipsilateral recurrence of tumor. The B-14 study established the benefit of tamoxifen. When chemotherapy was added to tamoxifen in the B-20 trial, there was an increased benefit. The B-18 trial demonstrated that the outcome of patients who received preoperative chemotherapy was comparable to that of patients who received the same therapy postoperatively. Moreover, results suggested that breast tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy correlated with outcome. Also, larger tumors were sufficiently downstaged by preoperative chemotherapy to permit lumpectomy rather than mastectomy. The B-17 study in women with ductal carcinoma in situ concluded that radiation therapy should follow lumpectomy in women with localized, mammographically detected lesions. The P-1 Breast Cancer Prevention trial showed that tamoxifen was effective in significantly reducing the incidence of both invasive and noninvasive breast tumors in women at high risk for the disease. Although many questions remain, and a new study, P-2, has been designed to compare tamoxifen and raloxifene, it is appropriate to offer tamoxifen to women who are similar to those in the P-1 study and who may benefit from it.","798":"Breast cancer mortality is declining in the United States, as well as in certain other industrialized areas--such as Canada, Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom--possibly due to increased utilization of mammographic screening, early detection of disease, and availability of improved therapies. At least some of the decline has been attributed, however, to the higher fertility rates of the cohort of women born between 1924 and 1938 who bore children during the post-World War II period. In contrast, certain European nations--Spain, Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Poland, and Italy--have not reported these favorable trends. The lowest breast cancer mortality rates are reported in Asian regions, leading researchers to speculate that dietary, cultural, and\/or environmental factors might be implicated in the etiology of the disease.","799":"","800":"","801":"Statistics are given for global patterns of cancer incidence and mortality for males and females in 23 regions of the world.","802":"The Surveillance Research Program of the American Cancer Society's Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance Research reports its 33rd annual compilation of cancer frequency, incidence, mortality, and survival data for the United States.","803":"","804":"","805":"","806":"","807":"Molecular biology, laboratory and human studies, and clinical trials have furthered knowledge about the pathogenesis, behavior, and treatment of brain tumors.

By comparison, 10 years of exposure to natural background sources of thyroid radiation results in a cumulative dose of 1 rad. Americans living in certain high-deposition areas received an average cumulative thyroid dose of as much as 16 rad. Individual dose rates vary considerably as a function of age at the time of exposure, site of residence, and dietary habits with respect to milk consumption. The individual cumulative thyroid dose for persons born between 1945 and 1958 may be significantly higher than the reported averages for their locale. The NCI report contains voluminous data tables permitting detailed calculations of individual dose. Additionally, color-coded dose maps allow one to approximate individual dose conveniently. Translation of cumulative thyroid dose attributable to 131I to predictions of increased rates of thyroid cancer appears problematic and is the subject of further study. In contrast to studies of patients receiving external thyroid irradiation, existing studies of patients treated with 131I for diagnostic and therapeutic medical purposes do not document increased rates of thyroid cancer. An Institute of Medicine task force is expected to issue a report on this subject in September 1998. This review also briefly summarizes the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with papillary and follicular thyroid cancers.

The procedure typically can be done in a period of 2 hours or less on an outpatient basis with minimal blood loss and with the patient under regional or general anesthesia. With more experience in using the equipment and the techniques described, urologists can treat all stages of localized prostate cancer with relatively little morbidity. The results of this technique in the treatment of prostate cancer continue to appear promising. With follow-up of 5 years or more available in several series, cryoablation appears to be an effective modality for the eradication of localized prostate cancer, particularly low-volume cancer (PSA less than 10 ng\/ml and Gleason score less than 7). Improved results, i.e., undetectable postcryoablation PSA levels and negative biopsies, may occur with modifications such as double freezing and pullback apical freezing. However, the complication rate also may increase with increased tissue destruction. To date, most complications reported have been relatively minor and require limited intervention. Notably, complications, especially incontinence, are significantly greater, in spite of successful eradication of residual tumor, in patients who undergo salvage cryoablation for recurrent disease after radiation therapy. In our experience, transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate cryoablation appears to be effective in controlling local prostate cancer in 81% of patients with minimal morbidity. As with radical prostatectomy and irradiation techniques, longer follow-up is required; however, at this time prostate cryosurgery can be considered in the following situations: as a primary treatment alternative to surgery or irradiation, as salvage treatment for recurrent cancer after irradiation, and for debulking of large symptomatic primary tumors. We look forward to the prospective randomized clinical trial comparing prostate cryoablation with external irradiation.","817":"","818":"","819":"","820":"Combined induction chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy is an effective treatment for selected patients with advanced-stage laryngeal cancer.

Hope exists that in the near future our capabilities will be bolstered by the availability of powerful new biologic and molecular genetic tools.

Oral nutrition should be used whenever possible; in patients unable to ingest adequate amounts orally, enteral and parenteral feedings are safe and effective.","832":"Initially, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was not used in cancer patients because of the fear of sepsis and the potential for stimulation of tumor growth. It was used first in cancer patients who had failed all attempts at enteral nutrition and in whom adequate anticancer therapy would have been otherwise impossible. TPN candidates today remain patients with responsive tumors who cannot tolerate the toxicity of cancer therapy because they are malnourished.","833":"A sufficient body of knowledge has developed about ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast to warrant a separate report on standards of care for women with this disease. This consensus report by these four organizations discusses evaluation of the patient, selection of treatment, technical aspects of diagnostic biopsy and definitive local excision, pathologic evaluation, radiation therapy considerations, follow-up care recommendations, and questions for future research.","834":"Because knowledge has advanced in several fields related to the treatment of early breast cancer, revising the landmark 1992 standards for breast-conservation treatment by these four organizations is appropriate. The current report reviews and summarizes the literature and describes the selection and evaluation of patients, the technical aspects of surgical treatment and irradiation, follow-up care, and areas for further research.","835":"The enactment of an effective national tobacco control policy is a needed first step toward reducing smoking, controlling the tobacco industry, and significantly reducing tobacco-related disease and death. Dr. Seffrin, Chief Executive Officer of the American Cancer Society, outlines the critical public health measures that the ACS is working to see included in comprehensive federal tobacco control legislation.","836":"The evaluation of common breast problems requires an assessment of the patient's risks and symptoms and a thorough physical examination. When indicated, appropriate imaging studies should be done, the patient should be referred to a surgeon or a breast specialist, and operative interventions should be used.","837":"Key findings on cancer incidence and mortality are presented for five racial and ethnic groups in the United States--African Americans, American Indians, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and whites. Information on the prevalence of cancer risk factors and screening examinations among these racial and ethnic groups is also included.","838":"The Surveillance Research Program of the American Cancer Society's Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance reports its 32nd annual compilation of cancer incidence, mortality, and survival data for the United States and around the world.","839":"Dr. Rosenthal, President of the American Cancer Society, notes that in this year's annual cancer statistics article, for the first time a favorable change in direction is reported. The data document a reduction in the total number of new cancer cases and declining cancer death rates in the United States. In addition, 5-year survival rates continue to improve for most cancers. Nevertheless, some areas still need further attention, such as the differences in survival statistics between African Americans and whites and the more favorable decline in mortality among men than among women.","840":"Considerable progress has been made in the classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas during the past 15 years, and the use of specific monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface antigens has contributed to the understanding of the immunology of the disease. Early-stage indolent lymphoma is treated with radiotherapy; treatment of advanced-stage indolent lymphoma varies. Aggressive lymphomas are treated with combination chemotherapy with or without regional radiotherapy, and highly aggressive lymphomas are treated with regimens similar to those for children with leukemia.","841":"Laparoscopy is an effective tool for diagnosis and staging of malignancies. Laparoscopic resection of abdominal tumors has been performed rarely, with two exceptions: laparoscopic adrenalectomy and laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer. One of the best applications of minimally invasive surgery is the use of laparoscopic techniques for palliation of abdominal cancer. Requiring thorough training and preparation of surgeons and mandating their strict credentialing will reduce the risk of complications from laparoscopic surgery.","842":"Treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas vary widely. Because all treatments are not useful to all patients, the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas must be divided into clinically relevant subgroups. Previous systems used to subdivide the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were based on morphology. Later systems added immunologic subgrouping. The International Lymphoma Study Group recently has proposed that lymphomas be grouped as clinical-pathologic entities. Diagnoses based on this system were much more accurate than those using previous systems, but much work remains to be done in the classification of these cancers.","843":"Needle biopsy of the prostate plays a central role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and the prediction of outcome. Strategies for sampling the prostate are being refined, which will increase the diagnostic yield. In combination with other clinical factors, the pathologic findings obtained from the biopsy specimen provide enhanced predictive accuracy for stage and individual outcome.","844":"Prostate Cancer Awareness Week is a recognized national event, the primary purpose of which is public education and promotion of early detection of the disease. This article describes a 5-year longitudinal study begun in 1992 to capture demographic and clinical data from patients participating in Awareness Week.","845":"Malignant transformation of the prostate and progression of carcinoma appear to be the consequence of a complex series of initiation and promotional events under genetic and environmental influences. Increased incidence of the condition may be the result of improved detection, greater awareness of the condition, and possibly an increased life expectancy accompanied by a decrease in competing causes of death rather than a true increase in the prevalence of the disease. The marked racial and geographic differences are probably multifactorial, with genetic, environmental, and possibly social influences affecting progression of the disease. Among several risk factors, evidence for the familial inheritance of some prostate cancers is compelling. Dietary influences, hormonal milieu, and the role of environmental carcinogens are currently under intense investigation. As further risk factors are identified, it will become increasingly important to identify individuals at increased risk for the disease. These men should undergo regular evaluation with state-of-the-art methods.","846":"The ACS National Prostate Cancer Detection Project was established in 1987 to demonstrate the feasibility of early detection as a cancer control strategy for prostate cancer. Ten years later, the compliance results suggest that early detection programs can achieve long-term participation in a healthy population.","847":"In summary, the 1997 revision of the ACS guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer is based on knowledge gained by a critical analysis of experience since the original version of 1992. This is only a milestone along a continuous journey rather than being the final destination. Other revisions will be considered when new knowledge becomes available, but for the present, this guideline is offered to health care professionals seeking to provide optimal care to asymptomatic men at risk for prostate cancer.","848":"","849":"Adjuvant therapy for colon cancer is now a mature and widely accepted standard of care for patients with resected large bowel tumors: adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer has also been shown to be highly cost-effective. The cost of 5-FU\/levamisole therapy for stage III colon cancer per year of life saved is less than $ 5,000, which represents a favorable cost-benefit relationship for a medical intervention. The clinician managing a patient with colon cancer at the present time has several options for therapy. In patients with stage III colon cancer, therapy with 5-FU-based regimens clearly increases overall and disease-free survival. It is also clear that the results that have been obtained are not perfect; therefore, the first option of therapy should always be an ongoing clinical trial. Many such trials are available, and Table 7 lists currently active studies in the United States. The clinician managing a patient with stage III colon cancer who is not in a clinical trial may choose a variety of regimens administered for durations of 6 to 12 months (Table 8). The preponderance of evidence suggests that 5-FU plus levamisole for 12 months is equal in efficacy to 5-FU plus leucovorin-based regimens given for a shorter period of time. A clinician may still choose the 5-FU plus levamisole regimen because of the decreased oral, myelosuppressive, and diarrheal toxicities associated with that regimen as opposed to the 5-FU\/leucovorin regimens. Portal vein infusion of fluorinated pyrimidines still must be considered investigational. Finally, although we cannot be absolutely sure about the benefit of adjuvant therapy in patients with resected node-negative colon cancer, the NSABP data suggest that some benefit may be seen in these patients. It is known that patients with stage II cancers demonstrating high-grade bowel obstruction or bowel perforation have poor prognoses with surgery alone. Such patients may be good candidates for adjuvant therapy. Also, a major effort to define high risk and low risk for recurrence in patients with stage II colon cancer by analyzing molecular genetic factors (tumor ploidy and alternations in tumor suppressor genes) may lead to a selection of Dukes B patients definitely requiring adjuvant therapy.","850":"","851":"","852":"","853":"","854":"We have reviewed management of the patient with colorectal cancer both after primary treatment and in the palliative setting. Although we have addressed quantitative measures of quality of life as applied to patients with colorectal cancer, the limitations of combining disparate variables that encompass morbidity, an idealized lifestyle, and personal variation in interpretation of that lifestyle into a single number or point on a graph are self-evident. The caring family physician has a better intuitive integration of patient complexity than does the outcomes analyst. When the apparently cured patient returns to the family physician after initial operative treatment, recovery is just beginning. We have addressed the morbidity of surgery, the role of adjuvant treatments, the short-term and long-term effects of adjuvant treatments on quality of life, and the management of these effects. Restoration of quality of life extends beyond cure or survival and embraces repair of the patient's confidence and psychosocial well-being. The patient with persistent or recurrent colorectal cancer merits the entire range of medical skills of the family physician. Not all patient findings arise from cancer; other treatable medical and surgical diseases occur. If findings are from recurrent colorectal cancer, the patient may still be curable by treatment or may enjoy prolonged quality of life with or without anticancer treatment. Do not rush to judgment about remaining life span. Although pain control is the benchmark of palliative care, psychological elements that affect severity of pain and the invariably associated depression of the patient require the emotional support and compassion of the family physician.","855":"The importance of considering quality-of-life issues throughout the treatment of these cancers is evident. Although quality-of-life variables are being delineated for cancers of various organ systems, safeguarding the patient's sense of well being and self-esteem while preserving organ, endocrine, exocrine, and hormonal function, fosters the best possible quality of life for the patient in either a palliative or a curative setting. The next millennium will usher into practice more aggressive, targeted therapies that combine surgery, radiotherapy, and genetic and biologic agents. The proper sequencing, administration, and toxicity of these therapies will decrease morbidity and improve the quality of life for patients. Above all, the healthcare provider must be aware of the patient's personal concerns and needs for a good quality of life. The dictum espoused by Hippocrates of \"primum non nocere\" (\"first, do no harm\") is nowhere more appropriate than in the planning of individual therapies to achieve optimal quality of life.","856":"A national task force consisting of members from the American College of Radiology, the American College of Surgeons, and the College of American Pathologists examined the issues surrounding stereotactic core-needle biopsy for occult breast lesions. Their report includes indications and contraindications, informed consent, specimen handling, and management of indeterminate, atypical, or discordant lesions.","857":"The following highlights summarize the principle findings of the NCDB, which are presented in more detail in other reports, some of which have been published and others of which are in press or submitted awaiting review. Collectively, these findings present a broad pattern of NCDB assessment of cancer patterns of care. In addition to the resulting journal publications, 1,600 NCDB participating hospitals receive a customized summary of similar patterns of care and outcome at their facility compared with national norms, which is then used for quality assurance purposes.","858":"In the past, differences in opinion among professional groups about colorectal cancer screening have been a barrier to colorectal cancer prevention. It is clear that screening for colorectal cancer is currently practiced by fewer than 20% of American adults. However, a growing consensus now exists that even though we do not yet have trial data to compare precisely the various methods for screening, there is now both a compelling case for screening and a reasonable set of methods that clinicians and patients can consider. By applying the knowledge we already have, it is likely that most of the deaths from colorectal cancer in the United States could be prevented.","859":"The American Cancer Society (ACS) convened a workshop in March 1997 to consider new scientific findings related to breast cancer screening and to determine whether these findings warrant a change in the existing ACS guidelines. The meeting was timed so that participants could benefit from new data related to screening women aged 40 to 49 years. A recommendation based on the new data and subsequently approved by the ACS Board of Directors is reported.","860":"This study reports on the 20-year follow-up of the women diagnosed with breast cancer in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) between 1973 and 1980. This project provided 5 years of screening with physical examination and two-view mammography for 280,000 volunteer women across the United States. Based on a 96% follow-up from 1993 to 1995 of the 4,051 women with breast cancer available for analysis, 2,658 (66%) were alive and 1,393 (34%) were dead. A high proportion of the cancers were detected by mammography alone, and 28.6% of all the cancers were smaller than 1.0 cm. Survival rates were calculated by life table method with deaths from breast cancer as the outcome. The adjusted survival rate for the entire group was 80.5%, and the observed survival rate was 61.7%. Adjusted and observed survival rates were 97.2% and 78.5%, respectively, for women with non-invasive cancers and 78.2% and 59.3%, respectively, for those with invasive cancers. Lymph node status and the size of the cancer at diagnosis were prognostic indicators of survival in the BCDDP Women with invasive cancers and negative lymph nodes had an 85.5% breast cancer survival rate and a 65.6% observed survival rate. Adjusted survival rates for women with invasive breast cancers were 90.2% for cancers smaller than 1 cm, 80.5%, for cancers 1.0 to 1.9 cm, 70.5% for cancers 2.0 to 4.9 cm, and 60.6% for cancers larger than 5 cm. Women 40 to 49 years of age demonstrated a greater survival with noninvasive or invasive cancers smaller than 5.0 cm compared with women 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 years of age at diagnosis. These results from the BCDDP are discussed in the context of the recent decline in breast cancer incidence and mortality in the United States.","861":"The Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project was initiated 25 years ago to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale screening for breast cancer. A retrospective view shows that it has more than fulfilled its mission; among other important accomplishments it has significantly advanced both the notion and science of population-based breast cancer screening and provided a huge data base for epidemiologic research.","862":"","863":"","864":"In summary, the ability to decrease the mortality of colorectal carcinoma is increasingly within the grasp of clinicians. With accurate family and personal history, it is possible to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer and initiate FOBT and colonoscopy where appropriate. In the future, germline and even somatic genetic testing will further increase our ability to diagnose cancers before they become widely invasive. As molecular biology unravels the cause of what currently appears to be the majority of sporadic cancers, it may be possible to characterize more colorectal cancers that are caused by novel, as yet not recognized mutator genes. Unfortunately, a set of patients is likely to exist who remain to be diagnosed by symptoms caused by advanced cancer. The goal for the clinician is to decrease this subset to as small a group as possible.","865":"","866":"Management of ductal carcinoma in situ has become one of the most controversial topics in breast disease. While mastectomy has been the traditional treatment, many now feel it is excessive in most cases. As a result, a great effort has been made to identify pathobiological characteristics of DCIS that can be used to stratify appropriate treatment decisions. This article reviews efforts to relate pathobiological characteristics to disease management and provides treatment recommendations based on the latest evidence.","867":"Interest in prognostic factors for breast cancer has been stimulated by the success of systemic adjuvant therapy for early-stage operable disease. Patients destined for recurrence can be selected for systemic adjuvant therapy, while patients not likely to recur can be spared the morbidity of unnecessary treatment. The number of tumor-related features available for prognosis has grown impressively in recent years. The purpose of this article is to review tumor-related biologic factors and relate them to prognosis and treatment objectives.","868":"","869":"The yearly cancer statistics article represents a snapshot of the evolving trends in cancer events, providing a reference point for evaluating the successes and failures of cancer control in the United States. Dr. Cunningham, President of the American Cancer Society and a Surgical Oncologist at St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, Illinois, provides an overview of important observations from this year's data, including the observation that for the first time overall cancer mortality is following a downward trend in the United States.","870":"In patients with hormonally sensitive tumors, estrogen replacement therapy carries a theoretical risk of stimulating recurrent disease as well as contributing to an increased risk of other hormonally related cancers. In women with hormone-related cancers, it is unknown if their inherently increased risk for other related cancers can be further increased by the administration of hormones. In genetically susceptible animal models, hormones have been shown to promote growth of hormonally sensitive cancers. The uncertainty and potential risk of hormone replacement therapy demonstrates the need for randomized, prospective trials to provide women with a reasonable basis for therapeutic alternatives. The most prudent approach with this population is to consider alternative treatments until the ongoing, randomized clinical trials have been evaluated with adequate longterm follow-up. Until such time, nonhormonal alternatives to manage symptomatic patients should be employed. It is incumbent on physicians to educate themselves and become adept in their use. Diet and exercise will have to be an essential component of the counseling provided to patients following cancer therapy.","871":"The preponderance of data support the benefits of HRT in estrogen-deprived and menopausal women to reduce the risks of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease and to enhance quality of life and life expectancy. Controversies exist with regards to the risk-benefit ratio in women with a history of estrogen-dependent gynecologic tumors or breast cancer. Until these issues are resolved, physicians must carefully weigh, on an individual basis for each patient, the potential risks against the known benefits. Women should be counseled regarding the benefits of exercise, weight control, breast feeding, and cessation of cigarette smoking or excessive alcohol to reduce their risks of cancer, cardiac disease, and\/or osteoporosis. HRT is not a panacea for an unhealthy lifestyle. When ERT is contraindicated, viable alternatives to retard bone loss and\/or control vasomotor symptoms include calcium supplementation and progestin therapy. The role of tamoxifen as an alternative HRT in women at increased risk for breast cancer development is currently under investigation.","872":"The American Cancer Society periodically assembles an expert advisory committee to evaluate recent evidence and update the American Cancer Society's guidelines for diet, nutrition, and cancer prevention.

Numerous studies performed to date have demonstrated significant benefits from the use of these cytokines. The side effect profiles, particularly for \"later acting\" growth factors, indicate that they are generally well tolerated by most patients. The table summarizes the potential indications for hematopoietic growth factor use as discussed in this article, as justified by current evidence of benefit, harm, and cost effectiveness resulting from their use in various clinical settings. It has been clearly demonstrated in standard-dose chemotherapy regimens that these agents shorten the duration of myelosuppression, reduce the incidence of significant infection, can shorten hospital stay, and reduce antibiotic use for most patients, although the cost\/benefit ratio for growth factors such as G-CSF makes this a cost-effective approach only for regimens with a high (40 percent or more) incidence of febrile neutropenia. Limited indirect evidence supports the use of growth factors in patients with a prior episode of fever and neutropenia. The suppressive approach to growth factor use could potentially benefit patients with documented infection or clinical deterioration, but it has not otherwise been shown to be a particularly effective or cost-effective approach. Administration of hematopoietic growth factors has been instrumental in facilitating both autologous and allogeneic peripheral progenitor cell mobilization and techniques such as ex vivo expansion. There is an increasing body of data supporting the use of high-dose chemotherapy regimens with progenitor cell rescue for a number of malignancies and limited data supporting the benefits of maintaining dose-intensity for certain malignancies in standard-dose settings. Although of continuing concern, clinically significant evidence of disease stimulation and recurrence has not been unequivocally demonstrated in studies to date. A comprehensive set of evidence-based guidelines has recently been published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. As often is the case, current studies have perhaps generated more questions than answers. Future investigation will undoubtedly focus on use of hematopoietic growth factors in conjunction with other techniques, such as outpatient-based treatment of febrile neutropenia, CD34-positive stem cell selection in autologous transplantation, selective manipulation of T-cell subsets (to decrease the incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease) in allogeneic transplantation, and high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation.","886":"Since its first successful application 25 years ago, the clinical use of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation has increased dramatically. Transplantation allows for the administration of high doses of systematic chemotherapy and radiotherapy and confers an antitumor effect separate from the effects of chemotherapy. However,complications including toxicity of treatment, graft failure, and graft-versus-host disease exist. This article reviews the history and current use of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and outlines new approaches for clinical application.","887":"For the past 50 years, the search has continued for systematically administered agents that can produce profound and lasting effects on human cancers. This has led to the use of many cytoxically and hormonally active agents and, more recently, to the use of biologic agents.

Superficial bladder cancer is remarkably sensitive to immunotherapy, particularly BCG. The use of BCG eradicates about two thirds of papillary carcinoma and nearly 90 percent of carcinoma in situ and reduces tumor recurrence by an average of 40 percent. Data now suggest that BCG immunotherapy reduces long-term tumor recurrence, disease progression, and mortality. The proclivity for tumor recurrence makes superficial bladder cancer an ideal malignancy for the evaluation of chemoprevention, and preliminary data suggest that high doses of vitamins may also reduce tumor recurrence. In locally advanced T2b to T4, N0 or N1, M0 bladder cancer, substantial clinical responses can be achieved if chemotherapy is used prior to surgical resection of muscle-invasive tumor (neoadjuvant treatment). Controlled trials are necessary to ascertain whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival. The use of CMV prior to and concomitant with bladder irradiation is also encouraging, but will require randomized trials to clarify its role in the treatment of invasive, nonmetastatic cancer. Finally, trials suggest benefit for chemotherapy used adjuvantly (after cystectomy) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, further investigation is necessary to clarify and confirm the role of chemotherapy in this setting before it can be recommended routinely for patients. In metastatic disease, chemotherapy with CMV or M-VAC with surgical resection of residual masses can produce a cohort of long-term survivors with advanced bladder cancer. How to increase this small but important population of patients is a question for further research.","890":"The study of occupationally related cancers has played an important role in the control of cancer in general. The very nature of the workplace allows for studies that can help establish a relationship between an environmental exposure and cancer. Once carcinogens are identified, strategies can be developed to prevent disease. The article reviews procedures for identifying, evaluating, and categorizing human carcinogens; provides an overview of the basic epidemiologic strategies that have been used to study cancer and the workplace; and outlines the clinical evaluation of occupational exposures.","891":"Occupational exposures to carcinogens are widespread and can result in tragic consequences for exposed workers. Clinicians are in a unique position to identify associations between workplace exposures and human malignancy, and virtually all occupational carcinogens have first been recognized by astute clinicians. Further, occupational cancers are usually preventable, and clinicians can be very effective in triggering preventive activities by industry, unions, and public authorities.","892":"","893":"","894":"Although cancer remains a major public health burden for African Americans, progress is being achieved. For both genders, stomach cancer mortality and mortality related to Hodgkin's disease showed large decreases over the past 30 years. Among African-American females, large decreases in cancer mortality occurred for nonmelanoma skin cancers, rectal cancers, and cervical and other uterine cancers. Tobacco use continues to decline among African Americans and, at present, is significantly lower among African-American youths than among their white counterparts. Despite these successes, additional work remains. Increased patient education regarding self-examinations and improved access to cancer screening are necessary to reduce the high percentage of cancers diagnosed at late stages among African Americans. Improved screening ultimately would increase survival and decrease cancer mortality. Some research has suggested that the increased morbidity and mortality in African Americans are related to poverty, lower education, and inadequate access to care as opposed to inherent racial characteristics. A recent study of black-white differences according to stage at diagnosis of breast cancer confirms some of these factors but also suggests that multiple factors may explain these differences, including mammograms, having a breast examination by a physician, and a history of patient delay. Such observations point to the importance of enacting broad social policies and establishing support mechanisms to diminish the impact of cancer in the African-American community.","895":"The American Cancer Society's Department of Epidemiology and Statistics reports its 30th annual compilation of cancer incidence, survival, and mortality data for the United States and around the world.","896":"Wilms tumor is the most common primary malignant renal tumor of childhood, representing about six percent of all childhood cancers in the United States.

Completion and clear documentation of the entire examination should be recorded. Detected lesions that do not resolve in a reasonable length of time--two to three weeks--require intense and assiduous investigation. The following specifics should be considered. 1. Alcohol drinkers and cigarette smokers, especially those 40 years of age and older, are at very high risk for the development of upper aerodigestive tract and lung squamous carcinomas. 2. The floor of the mouth, the ventrolateral tongue, and the soft palate complex are the high-risk sites within the oral cavity and oropharynx. 3. Persistent mucosal erythroplasia rather than leukoplakia is the earliest visual sign of oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma. These lesions should not be regarded merely as precancerous changes. The evidence indicates that these lesions in high-risk sites should be considered to be invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ unless proven otherwise by biopsy. 4. Toluidine blue staining is a useful diagnostic adjunct, particularly as a method of ruling out false-negative clinical impressions. It may also be used as a rinse in high-risk patients to encompass the entire oral mucosa after a negative clinical examination and as a guide to improve biopsy yields. 5.

As a member of the breast management team, the reconstructive surgeon provides valuable input on the appropriate timing and techniques for surgery. With the surgical oncologist and the plastic surgeon working together, the mastectomy and breast reconstruction can often be combined in one operation with less skin removal, shorter scars, and reduced inconvenience for the patient. Techniques of tissue expansion permit breast reconstruction without additional scars or significant hospitalization. With the development of autogenous tissue breast reconstruction techniques, women are also able to have natural, long-lasting breast reconstruction without the need for a breast implant.","907":"The treatment of operable primary breast cancer has evolved dramatically in the past few decades. The standard operative procedure has changed from the radical mastectomy to the modified radical mastectomy, and the use of breast-conserving treatment is increasing.

At present, the only clinically available method of breast cancer prevention is prophylactic mastectomy. However, there are no absolute indications for its use, and it is not often appropriate in relation to actual risk for disease.

This article reviews current concepts regarding the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ.","911":"We have reviewed the current status of primary chemotherapy for resectable breast cancer in view of the possibility that it may improve on results of present adjuvant drug therapies. The observed kinetic acceleration of micrometastases following noncurative surgical excision in animal studies represents strong biologic evidence supporting primary chemotherapy. From a clinical perspective, primary chemotherapy has consistently reduced the frequency of mastectomy in women with tumors initially considered too large for breast-conserving surgery. From studies of various drug combinations, it appears that the incidence of pathologic complete remission usually remains less than 10 percent. Based on results from the Milan study, it appears that the degree of tumor response is a marker of treatment outcome, at least for the first five years. A higher complete-remission rate could be expected by combining doxorubicin with paclitaxel, as has already been observed in the treatment of clinically disseminated breast cancer. In spite of the logical and scientific rationale, the available data do not as yet provide sufficient evidence to indicate a clear superiority of primary chemotherapy over adjuvant chemotherapy. The real question to answer through prospective, randomized trials is not whether the shift from adjuvant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy will result in a superior outcome, but rather how to properly integrate effective primary and adjuvant drug regimens to maximize tumor cell kill. This strategy should be further tested in patients at high risk for occult axillary adenopathy and\/or distant micrometastases (i.e., tumor size larger than 2 to 3 cm). However, a more-refined risk assessment approach (e.g., using tumor grade or proliferative index) will clearly be needed. The new treatment approach may also allow for a wider use of fine-needle aspiration biopsy to obtain the primary diagnosis of cancer, a more uniform adoption of breast-conserving surgery, and use of response to chemotherapy as a marker of treatment outcome.","912":"Results from studies of adjuvant systemic therapy for primary breast cancer accumulated over the past 20 years have clearly established that this treatment approach improves disease-free and overall survival rates in high-risk patients. As a result, adjuvant systemic therapy has become an integral component of the modern, multimodality approach to management of primary breast cancer. However, controversies about the most effective approaches remain, and research continues. This article reviews the current status of adjuvant systemic therapy for primary breast cancer and discusses areas of persistent controversy.","913":"In 1969, the late Roald M. Grant, MD, then Editor in Chief of CA, wrote an editorial on breast cancer titled \"The Foremost Cancer.\" In this issue, Jeanne A. Petrek, MD, an Associate Attending Surgeon in the Department of Surgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Arthur I. Holleb, MD, CA's Editor Emeritus, update Dr. Grant's essay on breast cancer and comment on the articles that appear in this issue.","914":"Neuroblastoma is the third most common malignancy in childhood and accounts for at least 15 percent of cancer-related deaths in children. The varied clinical behavior of this disease, ranging from spontaneous regression in some to progression while under aggressive therapy in others, has been associated with various biologic differences, providing insight into pathophysiology and possibilities for more specific treatments. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment of neuroblastoma.","915":"Brachytherapy is one of the oldest techniques of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. However, its use has been controversial due to mixed results with older implant techniques and the availability of different treatment methods. New methods of brachytherapy based on improved technology and increased understanding of radiobiology hold promise for consistently improved results. This article describe the various methods of prostate brachytherapy and reviews the clinical results for these methods.","916":"At present, increased early detection of prostate cancer appears to be the most feasible way to reduce cancer-related mortality. As a result significant efforts have been made to identify more men with curable cancer. This article reviews the role of serum prostate-specific antigen in an early detection or screening strategy and describes efforts to enhance the specificity of prostate-specific antigen testing.","917":"Several common misconceptions have fueled the debate over the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. While prostate cancer is often described as a common cancer that older men die with rather than of, the reality is that the incidence, mortality, and mean age and stage at diagnosis of prostate cancer are very similar to those of breast cancer, which is rarely the subject of similar concerns. Many studies have confirmed that given enough time, all clinically detected prostate cancers will inexorably progress locally and eventually metastasize to regional lymph nodes as well as to distant sites. The relatively slow doubling time compared to that of other cancers and the wide spectrum of biologic activity of prostate cancer have made retrospective studies reporting the long-term survival of conservatively treated patients highly suspect due to selection bias and inadequate follow-up. While it is accepted that a large number of men harbor clinically insignificant cancers in their prostate glands, these estimates have been based on careful pathologic step-sectioning studies of prostates obtained either at autopsy or after cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. Several studies have now demonstrated that currently available diagnostic modalities for detecting prostate cancer, DRE, PSA, and TRUS, are not able to detect a significant proportion of small, clinically unimportant cancers. Rather, studies have shown that while the traditional DRE has been largely unsuccessful in detecting prostate cancers at a sufficiently early stage for effective treatment with either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, a combination of the DRE and PSA followed by TRUS and ultrasound-guided biopsy in those with abnormal results can detect an increased proportion of clinically significant prostate cancers while they are still confined to the prostate gland and thus more likely to be eradicated by treatment. Several randomized trials are now under way in this country and in Europe that may settle many of these issues over the next decade. However, currently available data suggest that prostate cancer screening holds the promise of decreasing the considerable morbidity and mortality caused by this disease.","918":"","919":"The treatment and long-term survival of patients with ovarian cancer varies by stage. At present, five-year survival for patients with early-stage disease ranges from 50 to 95 percent, while five-year survival for patients with advanced-stage disease is less than 25 percent. Several new drugs with significant activity in advanced-stage ovarian cancer offer hope for increased long-term survival in the future. This article reviews the current and experimental approaches to the treatment of all stages of ovarian cancer.","920":"Ovarian cancer meets the criteria of a disease for which screening can be justified. The disease is most often diagnosed in advanced stages, when chances for long-term survival are poor. Yet effective treatment exists for early-stage disease, such that early detection can increase long-term survival. However, screening for early-stage ovarian cancer with the high specificity necessary for this low-prevalence disease has proven to be a challenge. This article reviews the issues of early detection of ovarian cancer, including pathology, statistical considerations, diagnostic modalities, and results of the major clinical studies undertaken.","921":"","922":"Health care workers and breast cancer survivors have an important role to play as advocates for breast cancer patients. At the most basic level, advocates must ensure that the patient has access to medical care. In addition they must help to ensure that the quality of care is optimal, enhancing the likelihood of survival, rehabilitation, and psychological adaptation. This article describes important advocacy issues for women with breast cancer, including informational needs, patient-physician communication, choice of primary surgical treatment, reconstructive surgery, adjuvant therapy, psychosocial issues, and employment and insurance problems.","923":"The National Cancer Data Base, a joint project of the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, provides a mechanism for periodic assessment of hospital-based cancer patient care.

This article provides a first look at highlights of the 1995 annual summary.","924":"","925":"","926":"Up to one fourth of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer present with liver metastases, and by the time of death, up to 70 percent of patients with colorectal cancer have metastatic disease to the liver. At present, surgical excision is the standard therapy for resectable liver metastases from colorectal primaries. This article reviews the natural history of colorectal metastases to the liver and results of studies of systemic chemotherapy, surgical resection, and alternative surgical approaches.","927":"The best way to control cancer is to find means to reduce the risk of cancer. Mr. Garfinkel, the former Vice President for Epidemiology and Statistics and Director of Cancer Prevention for the American Cancer Society, discusses the ongoing research on cancer prevention and suggests that based on the accumulated evidence, authoritative groups must now seriously consider making recommendations about chemopreventive substances to reduce cancer risk.","928":"Chemoprevention has been shown to be an extremely promising approach to the prevention of invasive cancer. Through the identification of chemopreventive agents that inhibit or reverse the process of carcinogenesis, new strategies of early intervention can be developed for patients at high risk that potentially prevent the onset of invasive and metastatic phases of cancer. This articles reviews the present efforts in chemoprevention research, including the identification of promising agents, screening, and preclinical and clinical evaluations.","929":"The American Cancer Society's Department of Epidemiology and Statistics reports its 29th annual compilation of cancer incidence, survival and mortality data for the United States and around the world.","930":"A multidisciplinary group of healthcare experts recently convened at a meeting sponsored by the American Cancer Society to report on and discuss recent advances in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer. This report highlights some of the important issues covered at the meeting.","931":"Chronic leukemias include a broad spectrum of disorders generally characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of mature, differentiated cells of the hematopoietic system. Clinical manifestations and treatment strategies vary widely among the disorders. In some cases, immediate aggressive treatment is required; while in others, it is more appropriate to withhold immediate treatment and perhaps not treat at all. This article reviews the pathologic features, clinical characteristics, and treatment of chronic leukemias.","932":"Major advances in the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of adult acute leukemias have resulted in significant increases in the number of complete remissions and long-term disease-free survivors. Despite these improvements, most adult patients with acute leukemias still eventually die from their disease or complications of its treatment. New experimental and clinical approaches used to diagnose, monitor, and treat these diseases hold promise for further increased cure rates in the future. This article reviews the classification, immunobiology, cytogenetics, diagnosis, and treatment of adult acute leukemias and describes new directions being taken toward their cure.","933":"The progression in understanding the biology of leukemia represents a remarkable bridging of clinical and laboratory science, which has provided much critical knowledge necessary for the design of curative protocols. Drs. Rachel Borson and Virgil Loeb, Jr., of the Division of Hematology\/Oncology in the Department of Medicine at the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis note advances that have led to increased survival in the present and research that holds even greater promise for the future.","934":"","935":"","936":"Surveys indicate that clinicians are frequently ill equipped to treat cancer pain. Pain is often poorly assessed, and many caregivers lack sufficient knowledge to optimize treatment. Effective management requires an understanding of pain pathophysiology, the ability to identify and evaluate pain syndromes, and familiarity with proven therapeutic strategies. Opioid pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Practical aspects of opioid therapy include selection of both drug and route, dose titration, and management of side effects. Specific strategies for the management of patients who are unable to attain an acceptable balance between pain relief and side effects include both noninvasive interventions (such as adjuvant analgesics, psychological therapies, and physiatric techniques) and invasive interventions (such as the use of intraspinal opioids, neural blockade, and neuroablative therapies). Sedation is an option at the end of life for the treatment of pain that is refractory to other interventions. These approaches can provide adequate relief to the vast majority of patients, most of whom will respond to systemic pharmacotherapy alone. Patients with refractory pain should have access to specialists in pain management or palliative medicine.","937":"In summary, the ACS has acknowledged the magnitude and severity of the cancer pain problem nationally and recognized that cancer pain can be relieved. It has identified cancer pain control as a priority and has devised programs that emphasize the importance of pain assessment, recognize the availability of pain relief programs, and encourage treatment to achieve optimum pain relief for the cancer patient.","938":"Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease for the patient and presents challenging diagnostic and management problems for the physician. A range of serologic and radiologic studies are available for evaluation and staging of this disease. However, invasive studies, including laparotomy, are often necessary to establish the diagnosis and resectability. Despite advances in diagnostic technology that have shortened the interval between onset of symptoms and definitive treatment, no appreciable impact on survival has been demonstrated conclusively. Operative resection offers the only hope for cure, but fewer than 15 percent of patients have resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. Palliative therapy, whether operative or nonoperative, can be performed with low morbidity and provides significant relief of symptoms. Combined-modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy prolongs survival following curative resection.","939":"Over the past year, the National Cancer Institute has altered its guidelines for early breast cancer screening by omitting any recommendation for mammography and clinical breast examination for women aged 40 to 49 years, while the American Cancer Society has reaffirmed its recommendation for these screening procedures in this age group. This article reviews the process and some of the evidence the American Cancer Society has relied upon in reaffirming its recommended guidelines for early breast cancer detection.","940":"Soft tissue sarcomas are the sixth most common cancer in children and collectively account for about seven percent of all pediatric cancers. The development of increasingly intensive, multimodality treatment protocols for these tumors has led to a steady increase in cure rates for these neoplasms, especially for rhabdomyosarcoma, the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. This article provides an overview of the basic biology, clinical management, and clinical research for pediatric soft tissue sarcomas.","941":"Soft tissue sarcomas are relatively rare in adults, accounting for less than one percent of newly diagnosed cancers in the United States each year. However, increased physician awareness of these tumors may lead to earlier diagnosis and improved results. The five-year survival rate has been increasing, and treatment using a combination of modalities has significantly reduced the number of amputations performed. This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of soft tissue sarcomas in adults.","942":"In most cases, soft tissue sarcomas in children are quite different from soft tissue sarcomas in adults and require a different approach to staging and treatment. Dr. Lawrence, Professor of Surgery and Director Emeritus of the Massey Cancer Center at the Medical College of Virginia, provides his insight into the differences and similarities in the clinical management of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas in adults.","943":"The substantial majority of questionable lesions detected by mammography are benign, and there is growing interest among health care professionals and patients in alternatives to surgical biopsy for diagnosing these lesions. Stereotactic breast biopsy is an x-ray guided method for localizing and sampling breast lesions discovered on mammography and considered to be suspicious for malignancy. Its use in sampling small, nonpalpable breast lesions has been investigated over the past 15 years, using fine-needle aspiration for cytology and, more recently, core-needle biopsy for histology. Multiple series comparing stereotactic biopsy with surgical biopsy have shown that stereotactic techniques accurately sample small lesions and have a sensitivity of 90 to 95 percent for breast cancer detection. State-of-the-art stereotactic breast biopsy is comparable in sensitivity to surgical biopsy, and the procedure is quicker, cheaper, and easier than the standard practice of preoperative, mammographically guided localization followed by surgical biopsy. In an age of miniaturization, stereotactic techniques provide miniature breast biopsies. The University of Chicago acquired the first prone stereotactic table in the United States in 1986, and we have found stereotactic breast biopsy to be a very good alternative for certain lesions that would otherwise require surgical biopsy for diagnosis. Most lesions (70 percent) sent to conventional biopsy at the University of Chicago between 1986 and 1989 were graded by observers as being in a low-suspicion category (less than 10 percent chance of malignancy based on mammographic findings), and the positive malignancy yield of this category of lesions was seven percent. These lesions were also examined with stereotactic fine-needle aspiration performed as a \"piggy-back\" procedure to the needle localization for surgery. The results of this study have led us to use stereotactic biopsy rather than surgical biopsy for low-suspicion lesions since then. We currently use stereotactic breast biopsy for about half the nonpalpable lesions considered for breast biopsy at our institution and find it to be reliable and readily accepted by informed patients. The introduction of automated core-biopsy guns has escalated interest in the technique, due to increased confidence in the histologic samples obtained and the ability to make specific benign diagnoses more frequently. Some centers have extended the potential use of stereotaxis to virtually all suspicious mammographic lesions, including those with a high probability of malignancy, to plan definitive surgery. Based on current estimates, there are now over 1,000 centers either investigating or using stereotactic biopsy for occult breast lesions.","944":"In the past 15 years, many of the mechanisms underlying the molecular origins of cancer have been uncovered, and a clear picture of the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in carcinogenesis has developed.

This article provides a first look at highlights from the 1994 annual summary.","951":"Since the 1930s the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons have been working together to create and support programs that collect and report on data on cancer patient care at a national level. The National Cancer Data Base is the direct result of this commitment. Funded through private donations and dependent on the voluntary, nonreimbursed time of hospital staff, it provides vital information on cancer patient care in the United States.","952":"After careful study of the literature and other information available to it, the American Cancer Society has found no evidence that treatment with the devices mentioned in this review results in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings. Lacking such evidence, the American Cancer Society strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment with such devices.","953":"True improvements in the treatment of cancer--by the introduction of new drugs or novel drug combinations, new therapeutic modalities, or technologic improvements of old modalities--result in higher response rates and prolonged survival when compared with existing therapies. When a new treatment convincingly meets the test of improving survival rates or, at worst, improving patients' quality of life, it becomes the accepted standard of care if its side effects are acceptable and its cost is not prohibitive. Improved therapeutic results can be demonstrated only by clinical trials with an adequate numbers of patients, appropriate control subjects, and a sufficient duration of follow-up. Therapeutic breakthroughs are revolutionary advances in treatment, usually rapidly and dramatically obvious in comparison with historic controls; demonstration of benefit in these cases does not usually require randomized trials. Much more common, however, are new therapies that represent modest, incremental advances over existing treatment and that usually require randomized comparison trials to demonstrate convincingly statistically significant improvement. A randomized clinical trial should test an important hypothesis. It must be carefully designed to ensure that both groups of patients are comparable in terms of various prognostic variables and to minimize subtle sources of bias. An honest belief that both arms of the trial are a priori equal must be maintained. Meeting these criteria, the randomized clinical trial offers to the individual cancer patient treatment that should be at least equal to the best available nonexperimental therapy. This equates with Good Medicine.","954":"","955":"Since 1967, the January\/February issue of CA has contained a cancer statistics article with data prepared by the American Cancer Society's Department of Epidemiology and Statistics.

This paper focuses on seven questionable modalities: vitamin C, pau d'arco tea, the Gerson diet, Hoxsey herbal therapy, the macrobiotic diet, Manner metabolic therapy, and Kelley metabolic therapy. Some of these approaches involve a diet that is nutritionally inadequate. Some involve potentially toxic doses of vitamins and\/or other substances. Some are quite expensive. All pose the risk that patients who use them will abandon effective treatment.

This article overviews the detection and treatment of testicular cancer, as well as its histology, epidemiology, and natural history.","977":"","978":"Cost-effectiveness calculations of prostate cancer early detection have not been possible due to the lack of any data demonstrating reduction in mortality from any test or procedure. Prior analyses focused only on cost assessments without consideration of any possible benefits. We used current data from three consecutive years of the American Cancer Society-National Prostate Cancer Detection Project to assess different economic perspectives of test performance, marginal costs, and benefit-cost analysis. The marginal cost, or cost per cancer, of digital rectal examination (DRE) markedly increased by the third year relative to several proposed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) scenarios. Sensitivity analysis for average cost showed that at 4 ng\/ml, pricing PSA below $30 would be the most potent factor in potentially lowering costs. Analysis of receiver operator characteristic curves suggested that optimal performance for PSA may be at 3 ng\/ml when combined with DRE or between 2 to 3 ng\/ml when used alone. Benefit-cost calculations demonstrated that DRE when performed by highly skilled examiners had the lowest cost. However, DRE became one of the most costly detection scenarios when a minor decrease in performance was assumed. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the three most determinant parameters of net benefit, in decreasing order, are: specificity, benefits from earlier therapy, and prevalence. If a slightly more specific PSA assay is developed, the higher prevalence of clinically detectable prostate cancer could also make screening less costly than breast cancer screening. Under the assumptions of these analyses, the combination of PSA and DRE appears to represent an ethical and economical detection choice for individual patients in consultation with their physicians. Additional research is needed to quantify the significance of differences between different screening strategies.","979":"","980":"","981":"","982":"","983":"","984":"","985":"","986":"","987":"The Committee for Freedom of Choice in Medicine is the political arm of several interlocking corporations promoting and\/or marketing questionable remedies for cancer and other serious diseases.

The most highly touted \"hyperoxygenating\" agents are hydrogen peroxide, germanium sesquioxide, and ozone. Although these compounds have been the subject of legitimate research, there is little or no evidence that they are effective for the treatment of any serious disease, and each has demonstrated potential for harm.

An additional three years of incidence and mortality data are included in this update of the earlier analyses; however, the focus of this report remains on examining the steeply increasing incidence trend between 1982 and 1986. Over this period, incidence rates for in situ and localized invasive tumors increased among women age 50 and older, while rates for regional and distant tumors remained stable. The incidence of localized tumors less than 1.0, 1.0 to 1.9, and 2.0 to 2.9 cm in size increased more rapidly than that of tumors 3.0 cm and greater among women over age 50. Survival rates also improved among cases diagnosed over this time period. These descriptive data suggest that early detection may be playing a role in the recent increase in the incidence of breast cancer in women, although other factors cannot be ruled out. Conclusions regarding improved cancer control await confirmation by reduced breast cancer mortality.","995":"During May 1987, a total of 10,207 Wisconsin women were screened as part of a statewide Breast Cancer Detection and Awareness program sponsored by the Wisconsin Division of the American Cancer Society. Data from a population-based cancer reporting system were used to predict the number of expected breast cancer cases for that year. After controlling for secular and seasonal trends, we found that, compared with the number of cases that would have been expected, 51 more cases of localized breast cancer were diagnosed in the state during the time of the program. This study demonstrates the public health impact of a statewide screening program and the usefulness of a cancer reporting system in program evaluation.","996":"Colonoscopy is an accepted technique for investigation of the colon.

It is therefore reasonable to offer radical prostatectomy for the cure of localized prostate cancer to patients who are otherwise well and have a life expectancy of more than 10 years.","1007":"Screening for prostate cancer represents a clinical dilemma with no clear evidence to suggest decreased mortality from any diagnostic test. We now possess new knowledge regarding optimal combinations of DRE, TRUS, and PSA. While DRE and TRUS may be too subjective and PSA too nonspecific, their combined predictive values identify not only men at high risk but also those for whom continued frequent screening may not be cost effective. A monoclonal PSA decision level of no more than 4.0 ng\/ml should be used, since 40 percent of cancers detected from 4.0 to 10.0 ng\/ml already have extracapsular extension. Assuming that DRE is performed by experienced examiners, the combination of PSA and DRE should produce cost-effective early detection and minimize missed cancers below 4.0 ng\/ml. TRUS should be reserved for those patients with either PSA elevations and\/or DRE abnormalities. The use of TRUS gland volume data to further modify PSA decision levels, such as the \"predicted\" PSA concept, may also improve TRUS biopsy criteria and predictive values. Prostate cancer detection can then be objectively limited to a small percentage of the population and better selected for earlier, more localized disease. The ultimate decrease in mortality from screening remains to be demonstrated in randomized trials or observed only after decades of increased public awareness about prompt early detection combined with effective, definitive therapy.","1008":"To assess nationally the use of questionable cancer therapies. Survey of cancer patients or their families regarding use of questionable methods of cancer treatment; sample survey of physicians' perception of use. 36,000 households; 5,047 individuals; 91 physicians. The prevalence of use of questionable cancer methods was nine percent overall. An increase in use was directly proportional to increased income and education. Prolonged illness and certain types of cancer were more commonly associated with use. Harmful side effects of questionable cancer treatments were regarded as modest (six percent). There was a wide range in cost. Third-party reimbursement was reported by 25 percent of patients. Important discrepancies were found between patients' and physicians' perceptions of questionable therapies. While some questionable therapies are harmless or inexpensive, others have toxic effects and may be costly, and none have scientifically proven efficacy. Although the percentage of usage reported is relatively low, overall large numbers of patients are involved, especially in certain groups. The physician plays a key role in encouraging or preventing the use of questionable methods, and substantial improvements in public and professional education are needed.

This article has described the important elements of any such screening effort. To be successful, the program will require a multidisciplinary cadre of health care professionals working collaboratively throughout all phases of the planning, screening, and follow-up process. An agency should be identified to lead these professionals and monitor the progress of the screening effort. These screening programs can have direct and indirect benefits in the community. The direct benefits include improved access and delivery of health services, particularly those that meet state-of-the-art quality standards. The indirect benefits involve the promotion of breast cancer screening through education of women and providers about good breast health practices.

A therapeutic trial remains the only method to determine if patients have responsive tumors, and several patients who do not conform to a defined subset do respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there is still a large group of patients with relatively insensitive tumors. Improved therapy for these patients will probably await advances in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and the other gastrointestinal cancers, since the majority of insensitive carcinomas probably arise from these occult primary sites. We have a registry at Vanderbilt and are attempting to register patients of other physicians around the country. We request pathology material and clinical summaries and follow-up data on all these patients. An unstained slide bank has also been established so that special stains developed in the future may be rapidly evaluated. These data may eventually enable us to better determine the frequency and spectrum of these neoplasms and may allow for more specific diagnoses and therapy.","1013":"","1014":"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is an intermediate-grade sarcoma that arises in the dermis of the trunk, proximal extremities, and less commonly, in the head and neck area of adults. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans has a deceptively innocuous early clinical appearance and generally exhibits an indolent course for years before entering a rapid growth phase. Its locally invasive behavior results in early recurrence if prompt, wide excision is not performed. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans rarely metastasizes through the bloodstream or, less often, to locoregional lymph nodes after multiple local recurrences. Fibrosarcomatous areas within the tumor result in a more aggressive course. Although wide excision is the mainstay of therapy, recent trials using the Mohs' surgical approach suggest that this technique may have a role in the future treatment of this tumor.","1015":"","1016":"Although cancer remains a major public health burden for African Americans, progress is being achieved.

Some patients are diagnosed using standard methods prior to arrival at the clinics, but many healthy individuals are misdiagnosed as having cancer or \"precancer\" and are then treated there. Others are told they have been cured or are improving even though they still have active disease. The modalities and regimens used are often referred to as \"metabolic therapy\" and, for the most part, are either not based on sound scientific principles or have been shown in controlled clinical trials to be useless or even dangerous. A basic metabolic regimen consists of three phases: detoxification with fasting and bowel cleansing, strengthening the immune system with numerous \"supplements,\" and attacking cancer with \"natural and non-toxic\" chemicals. Popular treatments include injections of hydrogen peroxide, large quantities of pressed liver and carrot juice, coffee enemas, infusions of Laetrile mixed with massive doses of vitamins and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), special diets, and a host of other pseudoscientific regimens. Unfortunately, no evidence exists that any of these modalities is more effective than no treatment at all. Patients traveling to the Mexican border clinics for metabolic therapy are subjecting themselves to costly and hazardous regimens, especially if they forgo responsible medical care in the process.

Examples of such data are the TNM histopathologic classification of the anatomic extent of the cancer used for the stage grouping (T = the extent of the primary tumor, N = the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis, and M = the absence or presence of distant metastasis); tumor size, histologic type, and histologic and\/or nuclear grade; assessment of blood vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion; analysis of steroid receptors, and other special studies as appropriate.","1036":"","1037":"","1038":"","1039":"While metastatic breast cancer is not curable, it is treatable.

His theory was inconsistent with biochemical facts and has since been modified at least twice by his son, Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. Extensive work has been done by cancer scientists to test the claim that Laetrile fights cancer. Many animal experiments in the 1970s showed a complete lack of tumor killing by Laetrile. Reviews of the medical records of patients whose cancers were claimed to be reduced or cured after Laetrile treatment found insufficient medical evidence to judge Laetrile's efficacy. Finally, in a clinical trial in cancer patients reported in 1982, Laetrile neither caused shrinkage of tumors, nor increased survival time, nor alleviated cancer symptoms, nor enhanced well-being. Several reports in the medical literature document instances in which Laetrile has caused serious, life-threatening toxicity when taken in large doses in the manner prescribed by Laetrile advocates.

With the exception of age, country of birth, and a history of breast cancer in both a mother and a sister, all of the relative risks reported to date are of a relatively modest magnitude. Thus, new risk factors need to be identified and knowledge of existing risk factors refined. Factors for which the evidence of an etiologic role has mounted over the past several years, but which are not yet considered to be established, include the protective effects of parity and lactation in certain age groups and the increased risks associated with alcohol consumption and with DES exposure during pregnancy. In addition, physical activity has emerged as a factor worthy of further study. Some evidence suggests that use of oral contraceptives for several years at an early age modestly increases the risk for breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 and perhaps age 45. Use of estrogen-replacement therapy for 20 years or more has been found by a few studies to increase the risk for breast cancer in the postmenopausal years; further studies of very long-term users are needed. Also, other risks and benefits of these hormones need to be taken into account when women decide whether to use them. Surprisingly elusive has been the etiologic role of endogenous hormones, especially in view of the large number of studies that have been concerned with them. A better understanding of the role of endogenous hormones should help explain the mechanisms of action of known and suspected risk factors. Areas of high priority for further research thus include establishing with more certainty whether the risk for breast cancer is increased in any subgroups of women who use oral contraceptives and estrogen-replacement therapy and determining the etiologic roles of specific endogenous hormones. The possible risks associated with alcohol consumption and lack of physical activity need to be studied more thoroughly, and ideas about new potential risk factors are needed. Although epidemiologic studies will continue to be concerned with diet, enthusiasm for its etiologic role in women has been considerably dampened by the lack of association in many of the studies reported to date. The studies in women exposed to radiation, DES, and oral contraceptives suggest that the timing of some exposures may be critical, since the effects of these agents may mostly be limited to specific time periods of rapid breast development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1048":"","1049":"Livingston-Wheeler's cancer treatment is based on the belief that cancer is caused by a bacterium she has named Progenitor cryptocides.

The effectiveness of breast conservation and reconstruction in preventing or ameliorating sexual problems after breast cancer diagnosis is less clear, however. Any impact these options have on sexuality is subtle and may relate more to a woman's feelings of being desirable than to how often she has sex, her lovemaking practices, or how much she enjoys sex. We need more information on how chemotherapy and hormonal therapy affect women's sex lives. As clinicians, we should pay more attention to our patients' complaints of vaginal pain, dryness, and overall loss of sexual desire during systemic treatment. Practical advice on lovemaking techniques and a clinician's open attitude towards discussing sexual issues can prevent a great deal of anxiety and sadness as women with breast cancer search for ways to keep their sex lives satisfying.","1057":"","1058":"","1059":"","1060":"","1061":"","1062":"","1063":"","1064":"","1065":"","1066":"","1067":"","1068":"","1069":"","1070":"","1071":"","1072":"A case of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the thyroid is reported in which treatment by means of radioactive iodine has been successful.

In October 1939 a pulsating tumor removed from the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra proved to be metastatic thyroid adenocarcinoma (histologically well differentiated, with small follicles and colloid). In the next two years hyperthyroidism increased and roentgenograms revealed new metastases in the lungs, upper part of the right femur, second rib on the left side, left ilium, and skull. Roentgenologic irradiation of the metastases proved ineffectual. In March 1943 a tracer dose of radioactive iodine revealed iodine retention by all the known lesions and no evidence of residual thyroid tissue in the neck. Therapeutic amounts of radioactive iodine were administered orally between May and October 1943. Definite and lasting clinical improvement followed. In April 1944 and March 1945 additional I* was administered with a resultant disappearance of pain, increase in weight, and progressive change in all clinical criteria in the direction of hypothyroidism.

In general, the design, quality, and analytic strategies used in these studies have improved over the years, and the number of subjects in each study has increased. The results from studies published prior to 1985 can be summarized as showing a small increase in the risk of breast cancer after many years of estrogen use. Even this tentative conclusion is debatable, however, since many rigorous studies showed no association between estrogen use and breast cancer. This review will summarize the earlier findings and emphasize several large, recent studies that add at least two new dimensions to this body of research; they provide data from Europe and on the addition of progestins to the therapeutic regimen. This review indicates the following: 1. Analyses of ever versus never use of estrogen-replacement therapy show no association with breast cancer risk. 2. Duration of estrogen-replacement therapy affects risk. Based on studies in the United States, a relative risk of about 1.5 may be reached after 15 or more years of use. 3. The increase in risk after long-duration hormone use is present for women with either a natural or a surgical menopause. 4. European studies exhibit higher risks after shorter durations of hormone use than do US studies. 5. The type of estrogen used and the addition of progestins to hormone-replacement therapy may alter the risk of breast cancer. Data that substantiate these points are reviewed and placed in context with hormonal theories of carcinogenesis.","1075":"","1076":"The contribution of radon daughter exposure to excess lung cancer in underground miners is universally accepted. These miners received exposures from tens to thousands of WLM in a relatively few years. Although the miners were also exposed to other noxious agents in mines, the appearance of the excess lung cancer mortality in several types of mines and the increase with increasing exposure provide convincing evidence of the role of radon as the carcinogen. It is conceivable that exposures to radon at an average concentration of one to two pCi\/liter, the levels for a majority of homes, might not produce excess lung cancers. This would require that a lifetime exposure at low concentrations produce a different response from that of a few years at higher levels for the miners. This is unlikely but not impossible. The current environmental epidemiology is of varying quality. The better studies may give some answers in a few years. These studies are more likely to establish an upper limit of risk than to provide an exposure-response model. Present risk estimates cannot be used accurately in estimating the overall lung cancer risk to the US population, since there are no good data on average exposure and exposure distribution. For example, the number of homes above the EPA guideline of four pCi\/liter may range from two million to 10 million. An estimate of the actual radon exposure in the US may be forthcoming from a planned EPA survey, but these data will not be available for a few years. In the conservative tradition of radiation protection, indoor radon exposures in homes are estimated to produce a number of excess lung cancers in the population. One estimate by the NCRP is about 10,000 deaths per year in the US, for an average annual estimated exposure of 0.2 WLM (about one pCi\/liter). The National Academy of Sciences (BEIR IV) estimates 13,000 deaths for the same exposure, and the EPA's estimate is 5,000 to 20,000.","1077":"","1078":"","1079":"","1080":"","1081":"","1082":"Bile duct cancer, although not among the common tumors, still accounts for more than 4,000 deaths a year in the United States.

Men and women who reported a good family history of longevity showed consistently lower death rates in each five-year age group than those with average or poor family history of longevity. Persons with an average family history of longevity generally had lower death rates than those with a poor family history of longevity.

Coronary heart disease accounted for about 35 percent of all deaths, with the proportion decreasing with age. Deaths from stroke rose from 15 to about 20 percent with increase in age. Deaths from all sites of cancer declined with advancing age in both sexes, from about 16 percent of all deaths at ages 75 to 79 to about six percent at ages 90 to 99.

In this regard the observation that PIN may be associated with elevation of the serum PSA is particularly intriguing. Considerable interest exists for early detection of prostate cancer. The high morbidity and mortality associated with this tumor coupled with the late stage at presentation by conventional means underscore the justification for such enthusiasm. However, the wisdom of screening for a cancer for which the mortality is far less than the histologic incidence remains to be proven. In the final analysis, the question is not whether we can detect more carcinoma, but rather whether we can significantly decrease patient morbidity and mortality.

In an early-detection program setting, the hypoechoic lesion proved to be twice as sensitive as a palpable abnormality in predicting the presence of cancer; for every two cancers detected by transrectal ultrasound, one was detected by digital rectal examination. When the presence of a hypoechoic lesion was the criterion for biopsy in a clinical setting, 41 percent proved to be cancer. Sixty-eight percent of these cancers were palpable; thus, for every four cancers detected by transrectal ultrasound, three were detected by digital rectal examination. Hence, in our diagnostic settings, transrectal ultrasound is more sensitive than digital rectal examination. Because transrectal ultrasound can measure tumor size and offer information regarding tumor spread, we recommend that transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy be performed first on all palpable lesions. Up to 50 percent of negative biopsies guided by palpation have subsequently proved to be cancer with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. If transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of a palpable lesion does not reveal cancer, however, a biopsy guided by palpation should be performed. Strategic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy for staging should be performed to obtain tissue from areas where microscopic extracapsular tumor extension is likely to be present. Based on presently available evidence, broader implementation and evaluation of transrectal ultrasound, a tool to be complemented by digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen, is advocated for the early detection of prostate cancer. It is hoped that the use of transrectal ultrasound will lead to increased survival, with good quality of life, in a cost-effective manner, for men at increasing risk from prostate cancer in the aging national population.","1113":"New as well as standard techniques for the detection and diagnosis of early prostate cancer have been described.

All of these innovations may enhance our ability to diagnose and follow patients with early prostate cancer. Full documentation and evaluation of long-term (15 to 20 years) follow-up, however, are needed to determine whether these new techniques will make a difference in the ultimate morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer in the United States. In the meantime, however, the use of these new diagnostic tools should not be avoided.

Patients should not be denied adequate cancer treatment because of the fear of complications secondary to malnutrition.

Appropriate clinical judgment is required in proper selection of the TPN candidate. Malnutrition is almost always a prerequisite, as is failure of the gastrointestinal tract.

The use of diets that are glutamine- and arginine-supplemented are only now being examined in animal experiments. Since TPN allows total and complete control of exogenous nutrients, it should be used to explore alternative therapies in the form of nutrient composition. For example, if tumors are preferential glutamine utilizers, then TPN-enriched solutions might be employed to increase the number of cells in a phase of mitosis that makes them more susceptible to attack by cell-cycle specific chemotherapeutic agents.

Using a statewide cancer registry system, the analysis suggested that the preoperative level of serum CEA was an indicator of survival in patients with colorectal cancer, independent of the stage of disease at diagnosis.","1146":"Breast reconstruction after mastectomy can avoid a permanent deformity. As a member of the breast management team, the reconstructive surgeon can give advice on timing and techniques. Breast reconstruction can either be started at the time of the mastectomy or delayed for months or years. Newer techniques of tissue expansion permit breast reconstruction without additional scars or significant hospitalization. Autogenous tissue breast reconstruction techniques are available that provide natural, long-lasting breast reconstruction without the need for a silicone breast implant.","1147":"","1148":"","1149":"","1150":"","1151":"The pathologic changes in tissues from 100 women who had received radiation therapy for breast cancer were studied. It is concluded that carcinoma of the breast cannot be considered a radiosensitive tumor, that irradiation should not be considered conservative treatment, and that radiotherapy is not innocuous. More studies of post-irradiation breasts are needed, from biopsy, surgical, and autopsy specimens. These studies should evaluate the tissues for the presence or absence of tumor, for radiation changes in the breast and the tumor, for evidence of tumor regression, for multicentricity, and for histologic types and patterns. Until this is done, the final results of radiation therapy for carcinoma of the breast will remain unknown.","1152":"","1153":"Locally advanced nonresectable radioresistant tumors can often be ablated by external irradiation using high-energy fast neutrons. Long-term remission, with local control rates of 50 to 70 percent, have been reported in a number of very large osteogenic sarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, melanomas, and adenocarcinomas of the alimentary tract. Malignant salivary gland tumors and prostate carcinomas respond well to neutron therapy, with high remission rates and significantly increased survival, even in locally advanced stages of the disease. Neutron beam therapy is a valuable adjunct in the management of nonresectable cancers that are resistant to conventional therapy.","1154":"Cancer-related pain can be well controlled in most patients. With prolonged survival and cure now possible with many tumors, pain management becomes a compelling issue for the quality of the patient's remaining life. In advanced stages of disease, analgesia is an imperative for both the patient and family; it provides the patient the opportunity for a dignified and comfortable death and lifts from the family the added burden of anger and despair that is so often associated with uncontrolled pain in a loved one. Astute assessment, a systematic approach to pharmacologic treatment, and ongoing monitoring of therapy are the fundamental elements of successful management of pain in most patients.","1155":"","1156":"","1157":"","1158":"","1159":"Recombinant interferon alpha has now been established as having a distinct if narrow role when used as a single agent in cancer therapy. The responses to single-agent therapy can be grouped as shown in Table 7. Interferon is likely to be the treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia and possibly also for symptomatic nodular lymphoma. Interferon is very useful in treating papillomas and condylomas, and its role as a local agent will probably expand. The list of responding cancers for alpha interferon or other subtypes as a single agent is unlikely to expand greatly over the next few years. Nevertheless, in both melanoma and renal carcinoma, meaningful responses do occur. It is important to be aware of the possibility of both delayed and increasing extent of response with duration of treatment; adequate trials of interferon may therefore require longer periods of treatment than does conventional chemotherapy. Furthermore, because prior failure to respond to chemotherapy does not predict response to interferon, its use as a second-line agent should also be considered. The future of such biological agents, however, clearly lies in combination with other agents as the \"fourth arm\" of cancer therapy. The challenge is to define what the role of that fourth arm will be. There seems to be a clear choice with the interferons. They can be used at pharmacological doses, in which case their antiproliferative effect is likely to be due to induction of certain enzymes that result in a cytostatic effect in susceptible cancers, of which there are a limited but therapeutically important number. Alternatively, the interferons can be used at physiological doses, which are more likely to cause immunological and cell membrane effects such as NK-cell stimulation, as well as Fc-receptor and tumor-antigen expression. Thus, combination with cytotoxic agents may well require high doses, whereas combination with other biological agents, such as monoclonal antibodies or LAK cells, may be most effective at much lower doses. Over the next few years it will be important to establish the optimal biological doses of the interferons, so that we can maximize their usefulness in therapy and avoid the trap of thinking of them as purely cytotoxic agents.","1160":"The following may be concluded about nicotine and smokeless tobacco use: Systemic absorption and levels of nicotine are similar in users of smokeless tobacco and cigarette smokers. Data from the few studies performed to date suggest that smokeless tobacco users develop a dependency similar to that for cigarette smokers. Effective treatment strategies to help smokeless tobacco users quit need to be developed. Smokeless tobacco use in young people also poses a concern for later development of dependence on cigarettes. The health hazards known to be caused by cigarette smoking and suspected to be related to chronic nicotine exposure are expected to be a hazard of habitual use of smokeless tobacco. A major concern in young males is accelerated coronary artery disease. Information about the potential health hazards of nicotine, as well as oral pathology, may be incorporated into educational programs to help discourage the use of smokeless tobacco, with a resultant decrease in the associated cancer risk.","1161":"In summary, evidence from human populations has shown that smokeless tobacco users have risks of cancer several times higher than that of nonsmokers. Smokeless tobacco is very strongly related to cancers of the cheek and gums, locations typically in direct contact with the tobacco. The association is evident in studies in the US and Scandinavia and also in Asia, where the chewing of quids containing tobacco and other ingredients is strongly related to the region's high rates of oral cancer. Reports on health effects date back to the 18th century and the evidence is consistent, with most investigators reporting positive findings. Dose-response relationships--increasing risk with increasing use--are also evident in several studies. Finally, preliminary work on cancers in other anatomic sites suggests that smokeless tobacco may also be related to other upper digestive tract cancers. With the exception of one group of medical scientists who described the relationship as only an \"association,\" expert consensus conferences and committees in both the US and France have agreed that the evidence from clinical, epidemiologic, and carcinogenesis studies supports a causal relationship between the use of smokeless tobacco and oral cancer in humans. These expert groups include the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1984), the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference on the Health Implications of Smokeless Tobacco Use (1986), and the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on the Health Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco (1986).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1162":"","1163":"","1164":"","1165":"","1166":"","1167":"","1168":"","1169":"","1170":"","1171":"","1172":"","1173":"Self-help processes of change are different and distinct from those of professional service and evolve empirically out of the patients' own experience.

Both methods appear to have a meaningful role in helping individuals with psychosocial problems, including patients with cancer.","1174":"Confronting the loss of sexual desire, feelings of sexual attractiveness, range of sexual activities, and ability to reproduce is often a seriously neglected area in oncology and a great source of distress for the breast cancer patient. Addressing the problem early in the doctor-patient relationship and simply giving the woman permission to discuss these critical concerns with the person managing her care will do much to reduce some of the anguish that accompanies breast cancer and its treatments.","1175":"Most-significant-others can play a major role in helping breast cancer patients live stable, productive, and esteemed lives. Physicians are urged to respect and exercise their clinical judgment on the emotional makeup of the patient, the most-significant-other, and their relationship, and to instruct them according to their needs and capacities. Supportive roles include mobilizing social support; monitoring the patient's return to daily living; being with her during treatments, both physically and emotionally; and understanding her instinctive requests for assistance through double-bind and other difficult communication. Most-significant-others can be an extension of the physician's common sense and clinical care to the degree that they are able and willing to perform this important role.","1176":"","1177":"In summary, the physician should view abnormal behavior in the cancer patient as an early and important diagnostic sign that an underlying medical problem (such as hypercalcemia) may be present. Depression and insomnia yield to intervention with antidepressants and hypnotics in cancer patients as readily as in noncancer patients. Finally, attentive listening is in and of itself anxiety-relieving and can go a long way toward reducing the emotional distress of people with cancer.","1178":"","1179":"","1180":"","1181":"","1182":"","1183":"","1184":"","1185":"","1186":"","1187":"","1188":"","1189":"","1190":"Depression is the most common psychiatric problem encountered among patients with cancer.

The relative five, eight, and 10-year survival rates were 88, 83, and 79 percent, respectively. Allowances were made for lead-time bias among cancers detected through screening, and the validity of the findings was supported by internal analyses, which showed that length-time bias was of little, if any, importance, and that any possible \"overdiagnosis\" of cancer cases was also of small relevance. In view of current interest in the value of screening women before age 50, intensive analyses were made comparing the BCDDP data for women in their 40s with women in their 50s. In terms of kinds of breast cancers found, modality of finding them, and survival rates once they have been found, the parallel results for the two groups show that screening was virtually as effective in the younger as in the older women. Some authorities are of the opinion that the benefits of mammography after age 50 are well documented, but at younger ages the evidence is still inconclusive. The findings in this study show there is no doubt of the very successful results of screening for breast cancer with mammography in younger as well as older women. In comparing relative five-year and eight-year survival rates for women with invasive breast cancers detected through screening in the BCDDP, with those for cases diagnosed in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (NCI SEER) program from 1977 to 1982, it is seen that for individual subcategories by tumor size and nodal class, the survival rates are about the same. However, for overall invasive cancers, the five-year and eight-year survival rates were 87 and 81 percent, respectively, for the BCDDP compared with 74 and 65 percent for SEER. Thus the substantial gains in survival followed the large shift toward a high proportion of cancers being diagnosed and treated in more favorable stages through the screening accomplishments. With respect to the relative case fatality rates, the complements of the relative survival rates, the eight-year rate of 19 percent for the BCDDP versus that of 35 percent for SEER connotes 46 percent fewer women dying in the BCDDP group.","1197":"","1198":"","1199":"There appear to be no substantial data to confirm the assumption that breast cancer in men with Klinefelter's syndrome is as common as breast cancer in the normal female population. The number of reported cases of breast cancer in Klinefelter's males is only 27, a number too small for any meaningful statistical analysis. There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent. Physicians should therefore be aware of potential breast pathology in XXY males and incorporate a careful breast examination and specific education into the routine health maintenance of men with Klinefelter's syndrome.","1200":"","1201":"Both CT and MRI address the pertinent clinical issues in the management of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and neck, and are crucial to staging, treatment, and follow-up. By combining the clinical assessment of primary mucosal extent with the objective information provided by CT or MRI about deep tissue extension of the primary tumor and any nodal metastases, accurate assessment of the actual pretreatment primary tumor and nodal stages is possible. With this objective picture of tumor extent, decisions about surgery and radiotherapy can be made for primary and recurrent tumors, as well as for nodal metastases.","1202":"Evaluation of primary lung cancers, pleural cancers, and metastases should be based on the TNM system. The optimal selection of imaging modalities can be difficult, and there is no universal agreement on the approach to the workup.

Tobacco and alcohol are the most important risk factors, but other agents may also contribute to malignant transformation. Individual susceptibility to environmental carcinogens, although significant, is still incompletely understood. Based on our present-day knowledge of risk factors, prevention should be possible in about two thirds of all oropharyngeal cancers. It cannot be achieved, however, without both public and professional education. A rational approach to prevention of oropharyngeal cancer should start in school before habits are formed, continued throughout adolescence, and reinforced in adults. Reduction or elimination of risk factors is of prime importance. For those who cannot quit tobacco, a reduction of tar content in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco, and elimination of nitrosamines, especially from smokeless tobacco, might also help to reduce risks. Control of chronic alcoholism is more difficult, but diet supplementation, especially with proteins, vitamins, and trace metals, would decrease the promoter effect of alcohol. Control of occupational risks is of less significance. The clinician must have a state-of-the-art understanding of all known risk factors for the prevention, early detection, and control of oropharyngeal cancer. The history should review in detail exposure to tobacco, alcohol, actinic radiation, and other agents. Age of first exposure or onset of habit; duration (years); quantity of tobacco smoked, chewed, or snuffed; and its relationship with the anatomic site at risk should all be precisely recorded. Exposure to alcohol or any other risk factor should be evaluated in the same way. This review has emphasized the relationship between the various risk factors and the site prevalence of malignant lesions. Habits, customs, and cultures, as well as anatomic physiologic factors, all have a bearing on the actual target sites at which the carcinogen(s) and promotor(s) are brought in contact with the oral mucosa. Habits and customs vary widely, both geographically and among individuals. Dentists and physicians should be aware of these individual factors as they examine their patients.","1215":"","1216":"","1217":"An estimated 145,000 patients will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the United States in 1987. Although half of these cancers are potentially detectable by sigmoidoscopy, rigid sigmoidoscopy is not widely used for early detection, largely because of discomfort it causes patients. Flexible sigmoidoscopy has been shown to be more acceptable and more efficient in detecting cancers. In order for flexible sigmoidoscopy to be of more value in cancer control, however, primary care physicians must learn the technique and incorporate it into their complete physical examinations. This paper reports the results of a multicenter trial that evaluated the training required for non-endoscopists to learn how to use the 30-cm flexible sigmoidoscope. Instructions with plastic models, followed by an average of six supervised patient examinations, proved sufficient for them to learn the necessary skills.","1218":"","1219":"","1220":"","1221":"","1222":"","1223":"","1224":"","1225":"","1226":"","1227":"","1228":"","1229":"","1230":"","1231":"It has been demonstrated that progesterone receptors (PRs) are at least as valuable as estrogen receptors (ERs) for predicting outcome in breast cancer patients. Retrospective analysis indicates that the presence of PRs may be the second most critical factor, after the number of positive nodes, in predicting disease-free survival, with a correlation between length of survival and number of tumor PRs. The presence of PRs has been shown to be of value for predicting response in both early and advanced breast cancer patients. In studies of assay consistency, major discordance rates were minimal in simultaneous assays, but extremely high in sequential assays of tumors that were PR-positive in initial assay. The responsible factor was interim endocrine therapy, and it was subsequently determined that the prognosis was worse for those patients whose tumors lost PR between assays.","1232":"","1233":"As noted at the beginning, a discussion of prostate cancer yields as many questions as answers. Yet, as this review has suggested, major advances in our understanding of the nature and treatment of prostate cancer have been made in recent years. As more unified and rational approaches to treatment emerge, some of the marked diversity in attitudes toward prostate cancer may lessen, and the controversies about management that characterize our present state of knowledge may abate. Carefully designed studies involving larger numbers of accurately staged and stratified patients are necessary to determine preferred treatment approaches for a disease that has such a tremendous impact on the health and well-being of so many.","1234":"Most premalignant penile lesions should be completely locally excised. Giant condyloma frequently cannot be distinguished from fungating carcinoma and usually requires limited penectomy. Cancers other than epidermoid carcinomas are very rare and, except for basal cell carcinoma, have a generally poor prognosis. Prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma, however, depends on the stage of disease as determined by both local invasion and by involvement of inguinal nodes. The three-year survival rates for 55 patients were: stage I, 95 percent; stage II, 67 percent; stage III, 29 percent; and stage IV, zero percent. Most primary lesions were treated by partial penectomy, and no patient developed local recurrence. There is a significant discrepancy between initial clinical and histologic staging, due to the difficulty of determining lymph node metastases. Current methods of radiation therapy indicate that it has a role for management of primary penile cancer, especially in young men with small lesions. The management of inguinal lymph nodes is still debated. Although the reliability of the sentinel node biopsy has not been established, it may be appropriate in patients with noninvasive primary lesions and no detectable inguinal metastases. The need for immediate or prophylactic lymph node dissection in patients with invasive primary tumors is controversial. Successful management depends on careful and frequent follow-up examinations, with early intervention for suspicious adenopathy. In view of the poor prognosis for advanced lymph node metastases, we prefer to use early lymph node dissection when the primary lesion is deeply invasive. Limited bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection is associated with minimal morbidity and seems to be an appropriate prelude to groin dissection. Extensive pelvic metastases are a sign of incurability and abrogate the need for groin dissection. We prefer to perform the inguinal dissection at the time of lymph node dissection through a separate curve groin incision.","1235":"","1236":"","1237":"","1238":"With respect to the most efficient approach to the diagnosis and treatment of carcinoma of the endometrium, the recognition of women at high risk can reduce this disease to a minimum and possibly eradicate much of the resulting mortality. Such an approach depends on the following factors: Recognition of the menopause as a time of life when high-risk patients may be identified. Recognition of adenomatous hyperplasia as a precursor of invasive endometrial cancer. Further research into the technology of obtaining suitable samples in menopausal women on an ambulatory basis without anesthesia is indicated as a search for efficient screening. Until such research yields new methods, however, recognition of the high-risk menopausal women through histologic sampling at menopause, with or without dysfunctional bleeding, can serve well. The modern FIGO staging formula shows the order of clinical virulence of any endometrial cancer and allows individualization of treatment in a manner that prevents overtreatment of those with less aggressive tumors and undertreatment of those with highly virulent tumors. Overtreatment causes an excess of complications, and undertreatment leads to a lower rate of cure than might be obtained by more radical treatment. Such individualization of treatment allows recognition of the appropriate place for surgical and\/or radiotherapeutic treatment and the combinations that are most appropriate for the particular patient. Individualization also encourages the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and more efficient use of those now existing. Hormonal treatment is indicated for several categories of perimenopausal or postmenopausal patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1239":"","1240":"Optimal management of the patient with the atypical smear requires a narrative description of the findings as well as frequent personal communication with the cytopathologist. When the cytologic abnormality suggests the possibility of an underlying early or poorly formed neoplastic lesion, colposcopy is recommended.

The palpation of what appears to be a normal size ovary in a premenopausal woman suggests an ovarian tumor in a postmenopausal woman. Ovarian cancer should be ruled out in any woman 40 years of age or older who has persistent, unexplained GI symptoms. Ninety percent of all ovarian tumors are of epithelial origin. Treatment consists of total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and appendectomy. Instillation of P32 is optional. In stages IIb, III, and IV tumors, chemotherapy is advised; in stages I and IIa, the use of prophylactic chemotherapy must be judged on an individual basis. In children, ovarian cancer that is beyond the localized stage is one of the most frustrating of all gynecologic diseases. Total surgical extirpation of disease is the only hope for cure; for now, early diagnosis is more chance than scientific method. Thanks to better public and professional education, ovarian cancer is now being diagnosed at an earlier stage. The earlier the diagnosis, the greater the chance for cure. It is becoming obvious that ovarian cancer is a disease of the GI tract, and physicians treating ovarian cancer should be prepared to deal with bowel-associated problems. The practice of tapping women with ascites for diagnosis as well as doing an exploration merely to obtain a biopsy should be discouraged. Unless the physician is prepared to carry out the optimal surgical approach for the patient, it is crucial that the patient be referred to either a center or to a physician who is actively engaged in the day-to-day care of cancer patients. With the combined use of all the available treatment methods, patients with ovarian cancer are now living longer and more comfortably. There is also indication that their long-term survival will be increased. The one message that is important for both patients and physicians is that the gloom and doom of the 1960s and 1970s can now be replaced by a spirit of optimism.","1247":"The cutaneous manifestations of internal cancer can develop either before or after the presence of an underlying tumor has been established. These signs may result either from the physical presence of tumor cells in the skin or from presumed metabolic effects of tumor cells located at visceral sites. Occasionally, skin involvement in cancer patients is biologically unrelated to the tumor but is instead part of a well-defined inherited syndrome featuring an increased incidence of internal cancer. Whatever the association, inspection of the skin remains an essential part of the complete physical examination.","1248":"Physicians with patients with cancer may be faced with two conflicting ethical obligations. One is to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge. Among the ways available to respond to this duty is to refer patients for participation in RCTs. The second obligation is to serve the health interests of the individual patient. When these two duties conflict, the latter obligation to the individual takes priority. In the words of the Declaration of Helsinki, \"Concern for the interests of the subject (patient) must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\" Quite often there is no conflict. The patient can pursue his or her health interests most effectively by enrollment in an RCT. In such cases, the referring physician can contribute to the success of the patient's participation in the RCT by explaining what the patient can expect to experience as a patient-subject. It is usually important to explain that referral does not necessarily entail severing the original doctor-patient relationship.","1249":"","1250":"","1251":"","1252":"","1253":"","1254":"","1255":"","1256":"","1257":"","1258":"","1259":"","1260":"Decision-making in cancer treatment is a complex art that requires specific attention by the physician who is principally responsible for the patient.

To achieve this, the patient must understand the situation and the likely outcomes of treatment options that might be of benefit, must be free of coercion and manipulation and capable of self-determination, and must be capable of reasoning. When a patient cannot collaborate in the decision-making, the physician needs to recognize this and a surrogate should be chosen to speak on the patient's behalf. The range of treatment options must not be unduly narrowed by lack of consideration, incorrect understanding of the governing moral and legal prohibitions, or unreflective use of imprecise categories.","1261":"","1262":"","1263":"","1264":"","1265":"","1266":"","1267":"","1268":"The impact of cancer on persons 65 years of age and older has been assessed by examining incidence rates and survival rates.

For elderly females, the incidence rate is twice that for females aged 45 to 64 (1,401.1 versus 609.7). Ratios of incidence rates for older versus younger males are about four to five for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, and urinary bladder, and for leukemia; about three for cancers of the lung and kidney, and for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; and 10 for cancer of the prostate. For females, the corresponding ratios are similar to those for males, although a little lower for cancers of the colon, rectum, and urinary bladder, and for leukemia, and a little higher for cancers of the stomach and pancreas. The ratios for breast, uterine cervix, uterine corpus, ovary, and lung are less than two. The relative survival rates for patients 65 and older are for many cancer sites only a few percentage points lower than rates for those 45 to 64 years of age (Table 5), suggesting that patients in this age group fare only a little worse than younger patients in escaping the effects of cancer once it has been diagnosed. Exceptions are cancer of the urinary bladder and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for both men and women and cancers of the uterine cervix, uterine corpus, ovary, and kidney for women. For these sites, the survival rates for older patients are considerably lower than for their younger counterparts.

Cancer represents a spectrum of diseases, and posttreatment impairments may vary from none, in the majority of cases, to major functional disability. Employers understandably have difficulty recognizing the variability that exists, both in terms of functional capacity and prognosis, and they are often unaware of the improved prognosis for many cancers. Today, many patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy or prolonged intermittent treatment and need to adjust their work schedule to allow for this. Some people need job training or vocational counseling; in many states, vocational rehabilitation agencies now have an increased interest in providing services to cancer patients. Discrimination against the cancer patient has been demonstrated; the major problems are in the area of hiring practices. Efforts need to be continued to educate employers and the public and to ensure that the rights of the cancer patient are recognized. We may, however, do our patients a disservice if we overemphasize potential problems to a degree that increases patient fear and insecurity in regard to employment. Instead, we as physicians may be able to help prevent problems by more effective communication with employers on behalf of our patients, as well as by direct patient counseling. The insurance problems of cancer patients, particularly those relating to health insurance, do require major attention. The potential productivity, as well as the quality of life, of the cancer patient are jeopardized when he or she feels unable to change jobs because of fear of loss of insurance coverage. The relatively high number of reported cancellations and changes in insurance benefits that have been reported by cancer patients also represents an area of concern, since some of these appear medically unjustified. The physician's opinion and input may be of importance in preventing or solving individual insurance problems. The physician can also help the cancer patient who has employment problems by providing information about available resources. The above-mentioned employment booklet (#4585-PS), available from the ACS, may be useful and contains information about legal resources. Referral to a vocational rehabilitation agency may be indicated.

In patients with larger, but apparently localized tumors (stage II), we now favor a staging operation (supraomohyoid neck dissection) to select those who require additional treatment directed to the neck. Our preference for patients with advanced tumors (stage III and IV) has shifted to mandible-sparing surgery whenever possible, in combination with postoperative radiation therapy. Using this approach, locoregional tumor control has improved while the morbidity of extraradical surgery and high-dosage radiation therapy has been avoided. This approach may not translate into longer survival times until effective chemotherapy is available to control distant metastases. Meanwhile, there is a need for both public and professional education to increase the proportion of early, curable lesions and promote the necessary changes in lifestyle (i.e., abstinence from alcohol and tobacco) to reduce the incidence of tongue and other cancers of the aerodigestive tract.","1281":"As antitumor therapy becomes more effective and less toxic, it is imperative to recognize potentially life-threatening or permanently disabling complications that may be prevented or reversed by prompt action.

With the exception of the proctoscopic examination and mammography, major detection procedures are being used with asymptomatic patients by a majority of physicians. In many instances, physicians' use of detection procedures does not conform with guidelines for the cancer-related checkup recommended by the American Cancer Society. Although they may disagree with some guidelines, most physicians agree they are generally helpful. Physicians disagree with guidelines for mammography, because they feel the cost of the test and radiation exposure associated with its use argue against patients' being tested annually, or being tested at all in the absence of symptoms. In contrast, belief that testing is needed at least once a year is the basis for physicians' disagreement with Pap test guidelines. Physicians also resist discontinuing use of the chest x-ray for early cancer detection, because they want to screen smokers annually. While there is substantial agreement on the value of proctoscopy in cancer detection in asymptomatic people, many physicians are not doing a proctoscopic exam if a patient's stool blood test is negative. Patient fear, discomfort, and the cost of testing influence physician decisions against proctoscopic examination. However, the growing interest in flexible sigmoidoscopy may change attitudes and influence practice toward more general use of proctoscopy. Primary care physicians widely support cancer education, both for the public and with patients in their own practice.","1285":"","1286":"Vagal body tumors (VBTs) are rare tumors of the paraganglion cells of the vagus nerve, usually occurring near the ganglion nodosum.

We present another measure of the magnitude of the cancer problem. We computed the probabilities at birth and at various ages of developing or dying of the disease within 10 years, 20 years, or total lifetime and show the trends that have occurred in these data since 1975. These probabilities were computed for males and females and among whites and blacks for 1975 and 1980, and projected to 1985. The data indicate a continuing, albeit modest, increase in the probabilities of eventually developing cancer in each of the four sex-race groups, both excluding and including carcinoma in situ. White males now show the highest probability at birth of eventually developing cancer, and black females, the lowest, with the figures for the other two groups being intermediate. Larger increases were seen for males between 1980 and 1985 (more than three percent) than for females (two percent or less). A child born in the US in 1985 has more than one in three chances of eventually developing invasive cancer (exclusive of epidermoid skin cancer). By site, for males the largest probabilities and the largest increases in the probabilities are for eventually developing lung and prostate cancer. For women, the largest eventual probabilities are for breast cancer, almost one in 10 for white females and one in 14 for black females. The largest increases are seen for lung cancer and cancer of the colon-rectum. The probability of eventually dying of cancer is increasing among the four sex-race groups and is now greater for males of both races than for their female counterparts. For males born in 1985, the chances of eventual death from cancer are almost one in four, and for females, almost one in five. With the long-term, downward trends in terms of other causes of death--most specifically, decreases in mortality from cardiovascular diseases--the effect on the population at large is greater longevity. This situation, in turn, leaves more people longer time to be exposed to cancer risks. Thus, while the probabilities of developing or dying of cancer are seen to increase, the increases should be viewed in light of the increasing numbers of people available for such an occurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1300":"","1301":"","1302":"","1303":"","1304":"","1305":"","1306":"","1307":"","1308":"","1309":"","1310":"","1311":"","1312":"","1313":"","1314":"","1315":"","1316":"During 1935 to 1951, a total of 75,494 cancer cases occurred among the inhabitants of Connecticut, of whom there were 2,000,000 in 1950.

This improvement is not due to earlier diagnosis of the cases, as can be seen from the similar distribution of localized and disseminated cases during the whole period of study.

A random sample of 445 subjects from rural Colorado were examined: 82.9 percent of the total sample were Caucasian, and 94.6 percent of those who used smokeless tobacco were Caucasian. This percentage supports the findings of an earlier urban study that the habit is predominantly one of male Caucasians. The average age of the users was 16.7 years, slightly older than in the urban study. Of the rural users, 62.5 percent had lesions of the oral tissues, compared with 48.7 percent lesional incidence in urban users. In both studies, those subjects with lesions had longer daily contact with smokeless tobacco, as well as a longer history of use than those without lesions. These are numerical averages that reflect great individual variations in susceptibility. The average duration of use for rural and urban users with lesions was almost the same; the development of lesions appears to be related to the length of daily exposure, which, on the average, was greater among rural users than urban users. Additionally, more than twice as many degree 3 lesions were found among users in the rural study. The habituating effects of nicotine and the influence of this substance on the future tobacco-usage patterns of youngsters who presently use smokeless tobacco are areas of concern. It is hoped that additional research will further delineate the scope of this current health problem.","1319":"Until recently, the use of smokeless tobacco had been restricted to a relatively small percentage of the United States population. The increased promotion and use of both snuff and chewing tobacco raise the question: What effect will such habits have on oral disease and the incidence of oral cancer? Although information for the US is sparse, extensive epidemiologic data are available from India, where the use of tobacco is prevalent and the incidence of oral cancer very high. The Indian data suggest that oral cancer and precancerous lesions occur almost solely among those with tobacco habits, the rate of malignant transformation of precancerous lesions is not greater than in the West, the relative risk of developing oral cancer is similar in India and in the US, and this risk rises with duration of use. Thus, it seems likely that increased usage of smokeless tobacco in the US will eventually lead to an increased incidence of precancerous and cancerous oral lesions in Americans.","1320":"","1321":"","1322":"","1323":"","1324":"According to animal, human, and laboratory data, the major, life-threatening risks to the woman from exogenous estrogens are neoplastic and cardiovascular.

Benign salivary tumors at all sites should be 100 percent curable, with a local recurrence rate of less than five percent; these local failures should be curable with further surgery. The majority of parotid tumors are benign. Sixty-two percent of patients with malignant parotid tumors will be alive at five years, 54 percent at 10 years, and 47 percent at 15 years. These survival rates for malignant parotid tumors are better than those for malignant tumors in the submaxillary and minor salivary glands and may be explained in part by the presence of a higher percentage of low-grade malignant tumors in the parotid gland. Since most submaxillary gland tumors are malignant, they are more dangerous than parotid tumors. A total of 80 percent of patients with submaxillary gland tumors die as a result of cancer. Almost all minor salivary gland tumors are malignant; curability relates to size, local extension, histology, and nodal metastases. Forty-five percent are alive at five years, and 21 percent at 15 years. Wide-field radical surgical excision is needed for malignant salivary tumors to minimize local recurrences and treatment failures.

Follicular cancer can be treated by lobectomy (for small lesions) or subtotal thyroidectomy. Although total or near-total thyroidectomy may be required in selected patients with large primary cancers or in those with extensive capsular invasion or extrathyroid extension, the number of cases indicating this is small. There were only a few such patients with large primaries requiring total thyroidectomy in this study. Total thyroidectomy is best avoided in most cases, considering the price of hypoparathyroidism and the lack of significant improvement in survival compared with lesser ablative techniques. Postoperative ablation with iodine-131 did not improve survival in staged patients with papillary cancer (the number of patients with follicular cancer was too small for analysis).

Unlike the tumors of adults, however, they have a predilection for the posterior fossa. The most common types of tumors among children are astrocytomas, ependymomas, and medulloblastomas. The definitive diagnosis of these lesions can usually be made with relative ease by CT scans of the brain. Treatment typically consists of the surgical removal of all or as much tumor as possible, followed by radiation therapy, and occasionally also by chemotherapy with one of the nitrosoureas combined with vincristine and\/or other antitumor drugs. Recurrence-free survival may be expected for about half of the children past infancy who develop brain tumors. The substantial progress recently made in both the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors in childhood has heightened, not diminished, the clinical responsibilities of primary care clinicians throughout the management of this disease. Since tumor-free survival so heavily depends upon an early diagnosis, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for commonplace non-specific symptomatology. The primary physician must pursue critical aspects of the medical history at the first suggestion of an atypical course. A skillful physical examination is then needed to detect subtle clinical signs that are indicators for the prompt performance of definitive diagnostic tests. Further, since there are now so many therapeutic modalities that can be brought into the comprehensive management of children with brain tumors, the primary clinician should maintain close contact with the patient not only to provide medical and psychological support, but also to monitor the clinical response or side effects of therapeutic agents and to serve as the patient advocate at times of great personal and family need.","1511":"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder was found at autopsy in a 65-year-old male.

Significant advances in the preoperative workup of a cervical mass attached to the carotid sheath are now recommended: ultrasonography, radioisotope perfusion scanning, and selective carotid arteriography. Catecholamine determination should be considered for any paraganglioma exhibiting vasomotor instability or hypertension. Prior to 1945 the carotid bifurcation was sacrificed eight times with a 50 percent mortality occurring in relatively youthful subjects.

For example, patients with leukemia or lymphoma may present with nodular skin lesions that may represent malignant infiltration, septic emboli, vasculitis, or a drug eruption. The most banal skin eruption may signal an impending or ongoing catastrophe. If one is able to make some clinical evaluation regarding the likelihood of a drug being responsible for the mucocutaneous eruption, it may help avoid further clinical or laboratory investigation and patient discomfort.

The same cannot be said of endometrial cancer, and this article outlines some possible diagnostic tests and indications for them in the hope of reducing incidence of and severity of endometrial cancer in peri- and postmenopausal women.  Women at high risk of endometrial carcinoma are those with adenomatous hyperplasia, which must be recognized as a precursor of invasive endometrial cancer: carcinoma in situ of the endometrium also qualifies as a true precursor.  This author recommends histologic sampling of high-risk menopausal patients, with or without the presence of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.  A discussion of the technology of obtaining histological specimens follows, with emphasis on the need to devise a means of obtaining histologic samples in all menopausal women on an ambulatory basis without anesthesia for screening purposes.  Vacuum curettage may be a part of such a screening.  The need to adopt a regular staging formula to characterize clinically the virulence of endometrial cancer is underscored, and such a formula is presented.  Other factors, in addition to screening, which will help control the incidence of endometrial cancer are recognition of the place for radiation and surgical intervention, recognition of menopause as the time of life when high risk patients may get identified, and caution in hormonal treatment in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women until evidence of its efficacy supercedes evidence of possible etiological roles in endometrial aberrations.","1551":"","1552":"Pure giant cell carcinoma of the liver is a rare tumor that is usually associated with cirrhosis.

The present controversy rests on the willingness or unwillingness of investigators to accept conventional case-control studies as a suitable substitute for clinical trials or longitudinal cohort studies.  In a clinical trial or longitudinal cohort study conducted with routine endometrial examinations, there would be no problem of differential detection, but the investigator has no way of knowing the magnitude of the problem in a conventional case-control study. \"Community surveillance\" is a problem that has been ignored in all of the conventional epidemiologic case-control studies.  This bias has led to a spurious overestimation of the association between exogenous estrogens and endometrial cancer.  The alleged causal association has been reported in 7 recent conventional studies that conflict with 2 older investigations and with subsequent research in which the magnitude of the association was substantially lower.  The attempt is made to demonstrate how \"community surveillance bias\" has produced the contradictory findings in the cited studies.  Community surveillance refers to medical examinations that take place before an individual becomes a case or control in the hospital.  A bias in surveillance can arise unless medical attention was sought by the patient and received prior to hospitalization in a manner that permitted the exposed (estrogen-taking) and the non-exposed an equal chance to become classified as cases.  When bias was reduced or eliminated by selecting control groups with comparable rates of diagnostic surveillance, the causal association vanished.","1568":"","1569":"","1570":"","1571":"","1572":"","1573":"","1574":"","1575":"","1576":"","1577":"","1578":"","1579":"","1580":"Cigarette smoking can be viewed mainly as a psychological habit with accompanying pharmacological and social satisfactions and reinforcements.

To quit smoking, the individual must undergo physical and psychological withdrawal. Physical withdrawal symptoms last about a week but it may take months or years to restructure a life without cigarettes. Quitting is a long-term learning process involving a great deal of unconscious, constructive and painful conflict. One can stop smoking if the problem is attacked on a broad front, if one \"burns one's bridges\" behind him\/her and if suitable satisfying alternatives and involvements are discovered.

Frozen section diagnosis forms the basis for further surgery. Because of the pathologist's role in this decision, he should be as familiar as possible with pertinent clinical data (e.g., previous biopsy or surgery) prior to operation. In some cases he may wish to observe the lesion in situ or suggest an area to be biopsied. Frozen section is very reliable in cancer diagnosis. A recent review of 2,240 consecutive sections has shown an overall accuracy of 99.3 percent with 13 false-negatives and only five false-positives. The technique is useful for most specimens, even tissue from needle biopsies. When the pathologist receives the gross specimen he must orient it and describe the color, consistency and size of the tumor and record its appearance prior to sectioning. The specimen must be carefully examined for any indications of inadequate tumor excision. Specimens may have critical areas close to the wound limits and the sections must be careflly oriented to prove or disprove adequate excision. Specimen roentgenography is very useful in evaluating excision and in pinpointing the tumor area. Microscopic description of tumors includes details of pattern, nuclear changes, stroma, and many others. However, only the microscopic findings which have prognostic or therapeutic significance should be emphasized to the surgeon. Summarizing the pertinent findings in a final paragraph of the pathology report can translate routine microscopic description into constructive clinical information which will give the surgeon a clear idea of the probable behavior of the tumor. In addition to the standard procedures for preparing and examining specimens for final diagnosis, there are some special techniques which are extremely useful. These include immunohistochemical staining, electron microscopy, tissue culture and biochemical studies.","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"","1599":"","1600":"","1601":"","1602":"","1603":"","1604":"","1605":"","1606":"","1607":"","1608":"","1609":"","1610":"","1611":"","1612":"","1613":"","1614":"","1615":"","1616":"","1617":"","1618":"","1619":"","1620":"","1621":"","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"","1631":"","1632":"","1633":"","1634":"","1635":"","1636":"","1637":"","1638":"","1639":"","1640":"","1641":"","1642":"","1643":"","1644":"","1645":"","1646":"","1647":"","1648":"","1649":"","1650":"","1651":"","1652":"","1653":"","1654":"","1655":"","1656":"","1657":"","1658":"","1659":"","1660":"","1661":"","1662":"","1663":"","1664":"","1665":"","1666":"","1667":"","1668":"","1669":"","1670":"","1671":"","1672":"","1673":"","1674":"","1675":"","1676":"","1677":"","1678":"","1679":"","1680":"","1681":"","1682":"","1683":"","1684":"","1685":"","1686":"","1687":"","1688":"","1689":"","1690":"","1691":"","1692":"","1693":"","1694":"","1695":"","1696":"","1697":"","1698":"","1699":"","1700":"","1701":"","1702":"","1703":"","1704":"","1705":"","1706":"","1707":"","1708":"","1709":"","1710":"","1711":"","1712":"","1713":"","1714":"","1715":"","1716":"","1717":"","1718":"","1719":"","1720":"","1721":"","1722":"","1723":"","1724":"","1725":"","1726":"","1727":"","1728":"","1729":"","1730":"","1731":"","1732":"","1733":"","1734":"","1735":"","1736":"","1737":"","1738":"","1739":"","1740":"","1741":"","1742":"","1743":"","1744":"","1745":"","1746":"","1747":"","1748":"","1749":"","1750":"","1751":"","1752":"","1753":"","1754":"","1755":"","1756":"","1757":"","1758":"","1759":"","1760":"","1761":"","1762":"","1763":"","1764":"","1765":"","1766":"","1767":"","1768":"","1769":"","1770":"","1771":"","1772":"","1773":"","1774":"","1775":"","1776":"","1777":"","1778":"","1779":"","1780":"","1781":"","1782":"In cytology studies false negative smears range from 1.8% to 20% due to different levels of cytologic expertise and of material presented to the pathologist.

Schiller's test, using a weak aqueous solution of iodine, leaves an area of carcinoma unstained but colors normal cervical epithelium a dark brown.

Once these females reach the menarche, periodic vaginal examinations are required.  A diagnosis of cancer should be considered when abnormal vaginal bleeding occurs.

Today, he states, we know that estrogens, when given in large does over prolonged periods, induce tumors of the breast, cervix, endometrium, pituitary, testicle, kidney, and bone marrow in mice, rats, rabbits, hamsters, and dogs (the most recent study cited being the development of breast cancer in beagle dogs after ingestion of an estrogen-progesterone combination).  The applicability of these animals studies to humans is defended.  Prescription of estrogens, which is extensive, is based on the negative animal study findings, the Chief states, and since chronicity of exposure to any carcinogen is the essential factor, dosage and duration of therapy must be carefully considered.  Synergistic and antagonistic relationships between estrogen and progesterone components of combination steroid preparations are noted.
